Claim by plaintiff for <damage type = "total">$2.3 million</damage> for damage to an Abbotsford, B.C., church caused by a Dec. 11, 2004 fire. Earlier that day, the defendant Sur-Del Roofing Ltd., through its subcontractors, had begun installing a new roofing system on the flat sections of the church roof. A propane torch was used to adhere the first layer of the new roofing system to the surface of portions of the flat sections of the church roof. The issues were: (1) whether the defendant was negligent in its performance of roofing operations at the church; and (2) whether the defendant breached its contract to perform its work in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with the prevailing standards for the repair and maintenance of roofs at the time of the fire. Damages were agreed at $2,300,000 excluding costs. 

HELD: Claim allowed; plaintiff awarded <damage type = "total">$2.
3 million</damage> in damages for negligence, plus costs and interest. The torch work on the roof stopped at roughly 6:00 p.m. and it was more likely than not that Hutchings was working in the dark without floodlights from shortly after sunset at 4:14 p.m. to approximately 6:00. Hutchings did not do even a one-hour fire watch, as he was home in Langley by 7:00 p.m. following a one-hour commute. The court accepted the evidence of Reed, an expert in issues of fire protection and the cause and origin of fires, that the origin of the fire corresponded with the area in which the roofing operations were being conducted, and that a mechanism was present by virtue of the roofing operation to readily ignite combustibles. The workers did not use a fibreglass basesheet and the absence of the fire protection basesheet was a significant factor in allowing the heat from the torch to penetrate the gap at the interface between the flat roof and the gable roof. It was not disputed the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care. The claim of negligence failed with respect to the failure to carry out a fire watch, however, as even a four-hour fire watch would not have detected the fire. The defendant was negligent in performing torch-on-work in the dark and in failing to protect the combustible materials. The standard in the B.C. Fire Code was that all combustible materials within 15 metres of the location in which hot work operations were being conducted were required to be protected against ignition by removing the material, shielding the material using a non-combustible shielding, or thoroughly wetting the area. Absent the use of any fireproofing material on the roof or any steps taken to protect the combustible materials, the defendant breached the required standard of care. The evidence, both direct and circumstantial, permitted the inference that Hutchings' negligence caused the fire by allowing the torch to ignite a smouldering fire. There was no evidence to rebut the plaintiff's prima facie case on a balance of probabilities.

Introduction
1  On the evening of December 11, 2004, there was a fire at the Mennonite Church (the "Church") located at 2360 Langdon Street, Abbotsford, BC.
2  Earlier that day, Sur-Del Roofing Ltd. ("Sur-Del"), through its sub-contractors, had begun installing a 2-Ply Torch flex SBS Modified Roofing System on the flat sections of the roof of the Church.
3  Sur-Del used a propane torch to adhere the first layer of the new roofing system to the surface of portions of the flat sections of the roof of the Church.
4  Sunset on December 11, 2004 occurred at 4:14 p.m.
5  The Church had an alarm system but no sprinkler system.
6  An alarm went off in the Church at around 10 p.m. The fire commander arrived in the third fire truck to reach the scene at approximately 10:36 p.m.
7  The fire was well-advanced by the time the fire trucks arrived and it caused extensive damage to the Church.
8  The Church was demolished and rebuilt. Damages are agreed at $2,300,000 excluding costs.
9  This trial will deal with liability only.
10  The action against Daniel Gerald Fisher is discontinued without costs.
Issues
11  Was the defendant Sur-Del negligent in the performance of its roofing operations at the Church?
12  Did the defendant Sur-Del breach its contract with the Church to perform its work in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with the standards prevailing for the repair and maintenance of roofs at the time of the fire?
Facts
13  The roof of the Church consisted of a flat roof surrounding a gable over the sanctuary. The gable roof was constructed of asphalt shingles over 1/2 inch fibre board on shiplap and 2 inch by 4 inch framing on flat edges. The underside of the roof was finished with 1/2 inch cedar over 1/2 inch gypsum board.
14  The north section of the roof was a flat roof with a torch-on membrane over 1/2 inch plywood sheathing. The flat roof had 2 inch by 12 inch joists and was covered on the underside with 1/2 inch gypsum.
15  Where the flat roof meets the gable roof, there is a gap between the joists of approximately 1 1/2 inches.
16  Both the gable and the flat roof had fibreglass batt insulation.
17  The contract with the Church required Sur-Del to remove the old tar and gravel roof on the flat portion and apply the new roof.
18  To accomplish this, the Sur-Del crew had to tear away a large portion of the flat roof, leaving the plywood base exposed. It was to this base that the new roofing system would be applied using a propane torch.
19  The field propane torches used by the Sur-Del crew are 2 1/2 foot long pipes connected to a propane tank by a length of hose and a regulator. The flame produced at the end of the pipe is approximately one foot long and has a temperature of 1,000 degrees C. or more.
20  The roofing system to be used has two layers, a base layer and a cap, hence its description as a 2-ply system. The base layer is known as 180 smooth and the cap, which of course was never applied, is identified as 250 Cap. However, before the two layers are put down, it is usual practice to use a fireproof membrane. The fireproof base is Number 25 basesheet and it is nailed to the roof at 3 inch intervals before the roofing system is torched onto that basesheet.
21  The point of using Number 25 basesheet is to provide a measure of fire protection.
22  The roofing materials are all manufactured by a company called IKO.
23  After the Church had solicited bids, it reviewed them for the lowest price and then interviewed the principals. A contract was signed with Daniel Fisher, the president of Sur-Del, for a 2-Ply Torch flex SBS Modified Roofing System with a 20-year Warranty for both roofs for the contract price of <damage type = "other">$20,400</damage>, payable on completion. Initially, the Church intended to repair only part of the flat roof and later decided to re-roof two parts of it.
24  Sur-Del costed the price for the job by calculating the price of materials required and the cost of delivery and labour.
25  In the costing analysis prepared by Mr. Fisher (at Exhibit 4, tab 2), the materials listed as required for the "20-year Torchflex System" are as follows:
IKO 25# Basesheet - <damage type = "other">$9.65</damage> per square
IKO Torchflex 180FF Base - <damage type = "other">$37.00</damage> per square
IKO Torchflex 250 Cap Sheet - <damage type = "other">$48.13</damage> per square
Accessories - <damage type = "other">$13.00</damage> per square
26  A square is the unit of measurement used for roofing materials. 100 square feet is one square.
27  Sur-Del placed its order (at Exhibit 4, tab 6) for the job at the Church on December 9, 2004. The order sent to Cedar Grove Roofing Supply Centre for delivery to the Church on December 10, 2004 at 2630 Langdon Street, Abbotsford "Roof-top 8:00 AM" was for:
51 Rolls of IKO 180 smooth
64 Rolls of IKO 250 cap sheet, light grey
7 - 2" plumbing stacks, flat, lead (plastic)
2 - 3" plumbing stack, flat, lead (plastic)
2 - Gooseneck vents
5 - 3" hotweld drains, flat.
28  The stacks, vents and drains are the accessories noted in the order. Under the contract, they were to be replaced.
29  Cedar Grove's invoice (at Exhibit 4, tab 7) indicates the following materials were delivered to 2630 Langdon Street, Abbotsford:
Torchflex IP 180 3.0 mm Base (illegible) (51) <damage type = "other">$34.70</damage> (emphasis added)
Torchflex IP 250 Frostone grey (illegible) (64) <damage type = "other">$36.00</damage> (emphasis added)
2" flat lead (7)
3" flat lead (2)
26 ga gooseneck vent - galvan (illegible) (2)
3" copper drain - Hot weld (5)
30  I infer that the bolded figures above indicate the price per square for the materials.
31  Sur-Del hires subcontractors to perform the roofing job. While Mr. Fisher is an experienced roofer, he does not do the work himself. He did not attend the Church while the roofing work was being done. He did go to the site late on December 11, 2004 after he was informed of the fire in progress.
The Witnesses
Edmund Giesbrecht
32  Mr. Giesbrecht is a member of the Church and part of the committee which hired Sur-Del. He is a painter by trade and looks after the inside of the Church.
33  He described the Church building as having a steeple over the sanctuary with a lower, flat roof from the front of the building to the back. The flat roof was tar and gravel and had begun to leak into the offices at the back of the building.
34  On December 11, 2004, Mr. Giesbrecht was at the Church around noon. He wanted to check on the roofers and to determine if the room he had reserved for an evening meeting was available.
35  He saw the roofers working. They needed electrical power. The Church was locked so he ran a cord out to the roof.
36  He returned to the Church at 5:30 p.m. to set up for his evening meeting. He is the chair of the new group he was meeting with at 7:00 p.m.
37  It was a clear cold night and it was getting dark as he drove towards the Church. He could see the flare of the propane torch as he came down the hill on Langdon Street about 200 feet away. There were no floodlights in use on the roof.
38  Mr. Giesbrecht is certain there was torching going on as he approached the Church. He entered the Church on the west side of the building to avoid setting off the alarm. It took him a half hour to set up his meeting. When he came outside, he went to the back of the Church, the north side, to see if the roofers still required the use of the extension cord. The crew member on the ground said they no longer needed the cord so he unplugged it and pulled it in through the mailbox.
39  He believes there was one person using the torch at 6:00 p.m. because he could hear the hiss of the torch as it was being used. He referred to hearing the noise of "pulling the flame". However, he was never on the roof during this operation, has never been in the roofing trade and he could not see the torch in use from the ground.
40  The meeting went on for an hour and refreshments for a half hour after that. At 8:35 p.m. he left the Church after having checked every door and setting the alarm.
41  When he walked through the Church to lock up and set the alarm, he did not smell smoke.
42  He did not see anyone on the roof as he drove off.
43  The alarm company called Mr. Giesbrecht just after 10:00 p.m. He drove up to the Church to check and when he was just a few minutes away, he saw smoke coming out of the back of the building. He met the police at the northeast side of the building (the back) but the fire was too advanced to get the Church doors opened.
44  Mr. Giesbrecht knew there had been a second fire in the boarded-up church two weeks after the first fire. He had no knowledge of the circumstances of that fire or the extent of the additional damage it caused.
Keith Forrest
45  Mr. Forrest is a retired gentleman who lives with his wife in a house across the street from the Church. He has never been a member of the Church.
46  Mr. Forrest's house is directly across the street from the Church. The north end of his house borders up to the south end of the Church entrance. His house is located to the west of the Church. Exhibit 3, tab 2, photo 2 indicates reasonably well what he can see across the street from his house.
47  He sees the gable and the shingle section on the north side of the Church and has a good view of the church because his house is on a built-up lot which is higher than the Church.
48  On December 11, 2004 he heard the roofers when he got up at 7:45 a.m. He saw them working for that day until after dark and observed the torch being used off and on for the entire day. He said it got dark about 4:30 to 4:45 p.m. He was home most of the day putting up his Christmas lights. He finished that task about 3:00 p.m.
49  Mr. Forrest testified that he saw the torch being used until about 6:00 p.m. by just one or two workers with the aid of an electric light but not a floodlight. It became quiet after 6:00 p.m.
Captain Darrel Slack
50  Captain Slack has been with the Abbotsford Fire Rescue for 24 years. He was in command of the fire at the Church on December 11, 2004.
51  On arrival at the fire scene, he saw 40 to 60 foot high flames coming out of the north end of the Church. The fire appeared to be venting, had burnt through the structure and was coming out on the north end where the flat roof met the gable. He noticed work had been taking place on the roof and saw roofing material and appliances.
52  It was Captain Slack's observation that the fire was concentrated in the sanctuary below the roof and into the wall where the flat roof met the gable.
Chris Reed
53  Mr. Reed testified and was qualified as an expert in issues of fire protection and the cause and origin of fires. His report was admitted as Exhibit 7 (the "Report").
54  The thrust of Mr. Reed's Report is that the origin of the fire was most likely at the interface of the gable and flat roof at the northwest corner of the gable where the application of the membrane ended.
55  At page 9, figure 9 of the Report, there is a picture of the northwest flat roof section on which the membrane had been applied to a point where there is a small piece of plywood and beyond that, bare plywood to which the membrane would have been torched on the following day, but for the fire. The bare plywood area is approximately 3 metres from the east edge of the flat roof. The membrane had been applied to that point and intersects the base of the gable roof. To the right in the picture is a plywood wall put up following the fire. Figure 10 is a photograph taken behind the plywood wall which shows the bottom portion of the burned through gable roof where it meets the flat roof.
56  Mr. Reed took these photographs.
57  Mr. Reed stated that the photograph at page 8 of his Report demonstrates a "V" demarcation typical of a truncated cone pattern caused by a plume of smoke and heat burning upwards into the roof space from a flat surface. At the point of the "V" is the area of greatest char and damage. Damage decreases as it moves away and this is consistent with the point of origin of the fire. This burned-through portion of the roof is the gable roof over the northwest corner of the sanctuary and corresponds on the outside with the point where the applied roof membrane meets that corner and stops.
58  Figure 11 at page 10 is a photograph of what Mr. Reed postulates is the area of origin, the intersection of the flat and gable roof. He states that this photograph shows the dominant burn damage to the sanctuary roof, the "V" demarcation originating from the three laminate beams which originate at the northwest corner of the gable end where the roof membrane stops at the interface with the gable and the extent of the burn damage to those beams and surrounding framing, all of which is only consistent with the fire developing at the roof intersection and burning within the concealed roof cavities.
59  He went on to state in his report that there were only two potential mechanisms which correlate with possible fire development at this location: electrical failure or roofing operations.
60  Mr. Reed examined the possibility of electrical failure and although he agreed on vigorous cross-examination that he could not absolutely rule out the possibility of an electrical fire, he was satisfied the damage he saw to electrical conductors and wiring was consistent with published data on fire exposure rather than fire causation. He was able to trace fire-damaged electrical circuits back to where there was no damage. Since the insulation on the wires outside the area of the fire was intact, it was unlikely there was any overheating in the circuit. This would militate against an electrical fire.
61  As well, there were no junction boxes in the area of the hottest fire so there was nothing other than the fire itself which could cause an electrical arc.
62  Mr. Reed was also put through his paces with respect to the effect of the roof membrane being tucked up under the shingles. His figure 12 was demonstrated to be schematic only. He agreed it was not accurate as to scale. Nor was it an accurate representation of the way in which the flat roof intersects with the gable.
63  In fact, there is no sudden transition, and no lip from the flat roof to the gable. Rather, it slants upwards at the interface and the shingles only begin about 8 inches above the 1 1/2 inch gap between the flat surface and the pitch of the roof.
64  Not much turns on this except that the diagram was prepared some time after Mr. Reed had visited the fire site.
65  Mr. Reed agreed with counsel for Sur-Del that the membrane itself is non-combustible although this does not mean it cannot be consumed by fire. In essence the non-combustible nature of the membrane would mean that the hot work performed on the roof would not require a fire watch after the roof was covered and so Sur-Del would not have violated the BC Fire Code even if no fire watch had been conducted at the end of the work day.
66  Notwithstanding the careful cross-examination of Mr. Reed and his concession that the possibility of an electrically-caused fire could not be absolutely ruled out, I find his conclusion compelling that direct flame impingement during the roofing process on the wood framing or fibreboard surface could cause an incipient or smouldering fire.
67  At page 14 of the Report, he concludes:
The point of origin of the fire was located directly below the area that a propane torch would have been used to seal the edge to the corner of the roof. There were no other sources of ignition in the area of origin and the witness observations of fire within 240 minutes of the work being done is consistent with laboratory testing of smouldering to flaming transition times.
The origin of the fire corresponds with the area in which the roofing operations were being conducted. A mechanism was present by virtue of the roofing operation to readily ignite combustibles. The use of the torch in the northwest corner of the roof bordering the sanctuary gable roof, the fire damage at this location, the temperatures produced by LP gas flames, and the propensity for fibreboard or other readily combustible material to initiate smouldering combustion are consistent with this fire occurring as a result of the roofing operation.
68  I accept those findings. I note that the defendant did not call an expert to rebut this report but sought only to raise alternative theories of fire causation.
Chris Hutchings
69  Chris Hutchings was the leader of the subcontracted crew of four hired to do the roofing at the Church.
70  Mr. Hutchings testified that he usually provides his own tools but had to borrow Sur-Del's tools to do the torch-on job. He did not give evidence of providing any goods or materials for the roofing job at the Church.
71  Chris Hutchings had a wide range of roofing experience but only one year's experience with torch-on roofing which he had acquired while working with Daniel Fisher.
72  Mr. Hutchings described the process he used to work on the Church. He arrived with his crew at between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. and proceeded to clear off the tar and gravel. It came up easily without the need for the roof cutter.
73  Once the tar and gravel had been removed and placed in bins, the bare plywood on the flat roof was exposed. At that point, Mr. Hutchings described placing the fire protection basesheet on the roof and nailing it into the plywood at 6 inch intervals with a 3 inch overlap. He explained that the use of the fire protection leaves no place for flame, presumably from the torch, to enter the roof.
74  The fire protection basesheet was nailed into place, 6 rolls in front, as he torched on the 180 smooth.
75  Mr. Hutchings also explained that a fire is not an acceptable outcome following the application of a torch-on roof and it is part of his job to make sure there is no fire.
76  Towards the end of the day, Mr. Hutchings worked on the area where the gable roof met the flat roof. He testified that he knew there were combustible materials in this area such as framing, building paper and fibreboard but he was also aware he could protect these combustible materials by covering them up with non-combustible materials. He did state that there was no fibreboard in the gable.
77  Mr. Hutchings was also aware that the 1 1/2 inch gap between the flat roof and the gable was an area of concern. It ran the length of the roof and only the old tar and gravel protected it from leaks. He stated he put fire protection over this gap although he did not seal the corners.
78  The technique he described to cover the intersection between the gable and the flat roof was to remove the nails from the first row of shingles and to slide the fire protection basesheet 6 to 8 inches under the first row of shingles. Then he would do a temporary tuck of the 180 smooth over the fire protection. The fire protection basesheet would be tucked permanently while the 180 smooth was only a temporary placement (a loose lay) to protect for overnight water leaks until the stripping (application of narrower strips of 180 smooth) around the edge of the roof could be done the next day. The 180 smooth would be pulled out, the strip torched on and finally, the cap would be applied and stripped adjacent to the gable.
79  The cap was never applied due to the fire.
80  To explain the use of the torch, Mr. Hutchings described how he would hook the roll of membrane material with the cane, stand on the edge of the roll and lift up the material with the cane. He would then put heat on the roof with the torch and on the edge of the membrane. It is the heat from the torch which melts the membrane and prepares the roof, not the flame itself.
81  Mr. Hutchings stated he would stand on the loose lay, curl up the edge and hold the flame away so that the flame was about four to five feet away from the shingles and from himself.
82  The intersection of the gable and the flat roof was the last part of the roof he torched on that day.
83  It is Mr. Hutchings' opinion that there was no fibreboard in the gable. He saw only plywood and explained the lack of fibreboard by saying that fibreboard would not be used on a pitched roof because it is too spongey.
84  Mr. Hutchings testified that he worked at torching until 3:30 to 4:00 p.m. He stated he knew that rain was coming and he would have to tarp the bare plywood by draping it from the gable. This operation took 45 minutes to an hour.
85  The fire watch began as soon as the torches were turned off, according to Mr. Hutchings. He checked for hot spots with his bare hands on areas where he had last torched. He was able to do this because the day was cold and the torch on membrane had cooled.
86  Mr. Hutchings then cleaned up the tools and waited another 45 minutes to an hour and went back onto the roof to check for the last time. He saw no smoke and felt no fire heat. In his view, the roof had cooled down and it was safe for him to leave. He believes he left for home about 6:00 p.m.
87  He stated he turned off the torches while there was still daylight. By the time he had finished tarping, it was dark and he was sitting in the truck waiting. When he went up on the roof the last time, he did not have a light with him because he wanted to be sure he could see the glow if a fire had started. He did not need lights for the earlier fire check because there were street lights and a light above the gable.
88  In cross-examination, Mr. Hutchings indicated that he and his crew had done about one-third of the roof on December 11. He agreed that he was trying to get as much done as possible. There had been occasions when he had had to work in the dark. However, he stated he would not do torch-on in the dark because it was impossible to see the seams. The material is black and it is necessary to line up the seams and have a 3-inch overlap. He agreed that floodlights were necessary for night work with torches and he did not have any at the job at the Church.
89  Even in the dark, with the help of ambient light from streetlights, Mr. Hutchings said he would have been able to see smoke had there been a fire. His fire watch lasted from around 4:00 p.m. until he left at 6:00 p.m., and during that time he felt for fire, looked for it and smelled for smoke. His last fire watch was in the dark.
Daniel Fisher
90  Mr. Fisher went to the Church to see the roof, give a quote and secure the roofing job. Once he got the contract, he did not return to the Church until he was called to the fire. He also went to the Church the day after the fire.
91  His wife ordered the materials for the roofing job from Cedar Grove Roofing Supply.
92  When he went to see the Church roof to give his quote, he saw the tar and gravel flat roof and the shingled gable roof. Below the place the shingles began, it was his observation that a rolled roof product had been used with tar paper down to where the tar and gravel roof butted up to the sloped gable roof.
93  Mr. Fisher explained that the joint between the two roofs would have been done by mopping the rolled roof into the tar and gravel. This technique would keep the tar paper up where it was needed and seals it to the tar and gravel. Above the tar paper was where the shingles began, a distance of 18 inches from the joint. The tar and gravel could not have been used up the slope of the gable roof because the hot tar would run.
94  The shingles were a high-quality non-flammable shingle which can be seen virtually intact following the fire.
95  Mr. Fisher takes no part in the installation of roofs except to make an inspection before the finishing material, the cap, is torched on.
96  If there are any issues with the job, the foreman will call. Mr. Fisher did not receive a call about this project.
97  Making a roof watertight overnight is an important step in roofing. At the end of the day the crew will check the seams of the membrane, cover the roofing materials to be used the next day with a tarp, and tarp the areas where temporary water protection cannot be used.
98  When approaching a different grade of roof, it is not possible to pull up a whole roll of membrane because a bond onto the grade cannot be obtained. In such an area, smaller sections of roofing membrane are torched on to get a better and more watertight seal. The use of loose lay as temporary water protection is common.
99  The fire watch Mr. Fisher has taught Mr. Hutchings to use, is a mandatory 1-hour fire watch but he requires a 2-hour fire watch while cleaning up and then a return to the roof to check after clean-up is completed.
100  He described instructing a check for smoke, and using smell and touch. In particular, areas with openings are problem areas, such as those encountered at a change of grade on a roof. It is Mr. Fisher's practice to wait enough time following completion of a day's work for everything to cool down.
101  In cross-examination, Mr. Fisher stated that the order faxed to Cedar Grove, the only supplier Sur-Del uses, listed some of the materials used for the Church roof.
102  He agreed that the fibreglass basesheet was not on the order but suggested it must have come with the roofing crew.
103  I note that Mr. Hutchings was the only member of the roofing crew who testified and he did not mention bringing the fibreglass basesheet with him to the job. As well, the materials for the roofing job were lifted on to the roof by the crane truck from Cedar Grove the day before the job commenced. How Mr. Hutchings and his crew could carry a substantial number of rolls of basesheet up to the roof was not explained.
104  Mr. Fisher agreed that the fibreglass basesheet was a component of the torch-on roof but said that it would work without the basesheet. However, he insisted that the basesheet was used.
105  Since there was only one delivery to the roof site from Cedar Grove, and there was no fibreglass basesheet on the packing slip from Cedar Grove, it appears to me no fibreglass basesheet was delivered to the Church.
106  If the fibreglass basesheet was not delivered to the Church, and there is no evidence of it being at the job site through any other mechanism, it was not available for use on the Church roof.
107  Notwithstanding the evidence given by both Mr. Fisher (who was not at the Church while the roofing work was being done) and Mr. Hutchings, it is my view that the fibreglass basesheet, the fire protection, was not applied on the Church roof.
108  Mr. Fisher attempted to point to fibrous material in Exhibit 14, photograph 4 to show that the basesheet was used. However, it is my understanding that the 180 smooth membrane applied to the roof contains a textile: "A tough non-woven polyester reinforcing mat ..." (Exhibit 4, tab 9, p. 3 Torchflex TP-180-FF-Base).
109  Mr. Fisher's credibility suffered somewhat on other topics on which he was questioned. Exhibit 13 is a letter prepared by Ms. Robert, Mr. Fisher's wife, at his instruction and based on information he provided to her. In it, she states that the roofers were finished at 4:30 p.m. However, on his examination for discovery, page 188, question 1234, he states he received a call from Mr. Hutchings (a change in his evidence in direct) at "2 -something, before 3 o-clock" to say he was wrapping up and that the torching was finished at 3 pm. He attempted to explain this discrepancy by saying that he is dyslexic and has trouble with time lines. He also indicated that the difference between 2:30 p.m. (wrap-up time) and 4:30 p.m. is not a big deal to him.
110  I note, as well, that at page 185, question 1212, Mr. Fisher stated they were done by 2:00 p.m. but did not get out of there until 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. They were doing preparation setting up for the next day and doing fire watches.
111  However, if the time the roofers finished torching were to be one of the determining factors in deciding liability, it would be advantageous for Mr. Fisher if the roofing crew wrapped up the torching earlier, because if the fire had not shown up by 8:30 p.m .when Mr. Giesbrecht left the Church, the fire could not have been caused by an incipient or smouldering fire resulting from the roofing operations since the lab data included in Mr. Reed's Report suggests that 240 minutes is the longest period of time which can elapse before a smouldering fire erupts into flame.
112  In discussing the fire watch, in cross examination Mr. Fisher stated there is no need for the person charged with the fire watch to be on the roof for the entire two hours. On examination for discovery, at page 184, question 1204, he stated the person would be on the roof for the whole two hours.
113  In cross-examination, he stated that floodlights would only be useful if a fire watch were being conducted after dark in poor conditions.
114  On his examination for discovery, at page 184, questions 1207 -1210, he stated that if a fire watch were being done after dark, floodlights should be brought in.
115  In all the above cases, Mr. Fisher agreed that he had given the answers at discovery and that the answers were true.
116  Mr. Fisher also agreed that to do torching at night, floodlights are required because while you can see the torch, you cannot see the product. He commented that without a floodlight "you could leave something open and have a leak".
117  I infer from Mr. Fisher's comment that if torching went on after dark without floodlights, it would be possible to inadvertently torch an area like a corner or a gap without realizing the torch had strayed into an unprotected area. In the absence of fire protection, it would be possible when putting down the loose lay and heating the edge to form the temporary bond, to allow the torch to stray into the gap, an area which Mr. Fisher stated would be of particular concern.
Conclusions on the Evidence
118  I prefer the evidence of Mr. Giesbrecht and Mr. Forrest about the time at which the torching ceased on the Church roof. Mr. Forrest, in particular, is not now, nor has he ever been, a member of the Church. He has nothing to gain through giving evidence. I also found Mr. Giesbrecht to be a careful and honest witness.
119  I find that the torch work on the roof stopped at approximately 6:00 p.m. and that it is more likely than not that Mr. Hutchings was working in the dark without floodlights from shortly after sunset at 4:14 p.m. on December 11, 2004 to approximately 6:00 p.m.
120  Since I do not accept Mr. Hutchings' evidence that he stopped torching at between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m., and Mr. Fisher was not there to be able to support that assertion, I find that Mr. Hutchings did not do a two-hour fire watch or even a one-hour fire watch since he would have finished work around 6:00 p.m. and was home in Langley by 7:00 p.m. following a commute of approximately one hour.
121  Based on the factors Mr. Reed has set out in his Report and on the observation of Captain Slack at the scene, I find that the northwest corner of the interface between the gable and the flat roof where Mr. Hutchings finished torching that day and placed a loose lay under the shingles, was the place at which the fire originated.
122  I find that the workers did not use a fibreglass basesheet and the absence of the fire protection basesheet was a significant factor in allowing the heat from the torch to penetrate the gap at the interface between the flat roof and the gable roof.
Analysis
Negligence
123  To establish a claim for negligence the plaintiff must satisfy the Court that the defendants owed the plaintiff a duty of care; that the defendant breached that duty of care; and that damages resulted from that breach.
124  It is not disputed that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care and therefore the central issues to be determined are whether the defendant breached the relevant standard of care and if so whether that breach caused the fire.
125  The plaintiff asserts that the defendant was negligent in three respects: performing torch-on roofing work in the dark without the benefit of floodlights when it was unsafe to do so; failing to protect combustible materials in the vicinity of the torch-on work; and failing to carry out a reasonable fire watch after they had completed their work on the roof.
126  With respect to standard of care, the plaintiff submits that the applicable standard of care for a roofer performing torch-on work in British Columbia at that time can be found in the provisions of the 1998 British Columbia Fire Code,  ["Code"]. The plaintiff points to the testimony of Mr. Reed, who was qualified as an expert in fire prevention, who relied on the Code in forming his opinion regarding the appropriate precautions that ought to be taken in applying a torch-on membrane. The Code sets out minimum requirements respecting fire safety. Section 5.2 of the Code concerns "hot works", and applies to "hot works involving open flames or producing heat or sparks, including ... adhesive bonding ...": s. 5.2.1.1.1.
127  The plaintiff submits that the provisions that are relevant to the standard of care in issue in the present matter are found at s. 5.2.3 and provide as follows:
5.2.3 Prevention of Fires
5.2.3.1. Location of Operations
Except as provided in Sentence (2), hot work shall be carried out in an area free of combustible and flammable contents, with walls, ceilings and floors of non-combustible construction or lined with non combustible materials.
When it is not practicable to undertake hot work in an area described in Sentence (1),
combustible and flammable materials within a 15 m distance from the hot work shall be protected against ignition in conformance with Article 5.2.3.2.,
a fire watch shall be provided during the hot work and for a period of not less than 60 min after its completion in conformance with Article 5.2.3.3., and
a final inspection of the hot work area shall be conducted 4 h after completion of work.
...
5.2.3.2. Protection of Combustible and Flammable Materials
Any combustible and flammable material, dust or residue shall be
removed from the area where hot work is carried out, or
protected against ignition by the use of noncombustible materials.
Combustible materials or building surfaces that cannot be removed or protected against ignition as required in Sentence (1) shall be thoroughly wetted where hot work is carried out
...
128  The Code adopted the provisions of the 1995 National Fire Code of Canada, which was accepted as the standard of care in a negligence case against a roofing company that was alleged to have caused a fire: Decoste Manufacturing Ltd. v. A & B Roofing Ltd.,  at para. 27; see also Trans North Turbot Air Ltd. v. North 60 Petro Ltd.,  at para. 232, aff'd  with respect to welding. While the Supreme Court of Canada clearly states that there is no such thing as a tort for breach of a statutory duty: The Queen (Canada) v. Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, , , the Code can be used as evidence of what the standard of care would have been. The use of the Code is supported by the expert evidence of Mr. Reed that the appropriate precautions that ought to be taken are set out in the Code.
129  The defendant asserts that the applicable standard of care should be based on the standard practice of the particular industry, the roofing industry, and that the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate either that the defendant fell short of the general industry practice, or that the industry practice itself involves negligence: Webster v. Robinson,  (S.C.); and Hollis v. Birch,  (S.C.). Because the defendants produced no independent or reliable evidence with respect to the appropriate standard of care other than with respect to fire watches, the Court accepts that the standard of care for torch-on roofing work in British Columbia at the time was the 1998 British Columbia Fire Code.
130  The defendant did point to two alternate sources of evidence as to the appropriate standard of care with respect to fire watch requirements: the Manual published by the Roofing Contractors' Association and the standards set by the Workers' Compensation Board of B.C. both specifically in relation to torch-on roofing, and both of which require a one hour fire watch only. The question of which standard applies in this case, however, is not necessary for me to decide. I have already found as a fact that Mr. Hutchings did not do a one-hour fire watch since he was home in Langley by 7:00 p.m. Therefore, even if one hour were to be the applicable standard, Mr. Hutchings would have been in breach. However, it is not likely that the lack of a fire watch was determinative in any event, as the fire alarm did not go off until 10:00 p.m. Therefore, unless I were to find that a four-hour fire watch was the standard prevailing in the roofing industry, which was not determined on the evidence, a fire watch would not have detected the fire. The plaintiff's claim of negligence fails with respect to the defendant's failure to carry out a fire watch.
131  With respect to the plaintiff's other two claims: that the defendant was negligent in performing torch-on work in the dark and in failing to protect the combustible materials, it is my view that Sur-Del was negligent in those respects in the performance of its roofing operations at the Church.
132  The evidence at trial established that the work on the roof stopped at approximately 6:00 p.m. Mr. Forrest stated that it was getting dark at around 4:30 to 4:45 p.m. Because the sun set at 4:14 p.m. on December 11, 2004, work would have been performed in the dark for an hour to an hour and a half. The evidence established that torch-on work was being performed until around 6:00 p.m. It was not disputed that no floodlights were used at the Church. Mr. Fisher testified in his examination for discovery that it is general industry standard to use floodlights if you are performing torch-on work in the dark. The defendant was therefore in breach of the requisite standard of care.
133  Furthermore, I find that the defendant was in breach of the standard set out in the Code that requires that all combustible materials within 15 metres of the location in which hot work operations are being conducted are required to be protected against ignition by removing the material, shielding the material using a non-combustible shielding, or thoroughly wetting the area. The gabled area of the roof was not covered by non-combustible shielding or wetted down when Mr. Hutchings was performing torch-on work in the immediate area. I have also found as a fact that the defendant did not use a fibreglass basesheet, which was the fireproofing material that they claimed to have been using. Absent the use of any fireproofing material on the roof or any steps taken to protect the combustible materials, the defendant breached the standard of care required in the circumstances.
134  Having found the defendant breached the requisite standard of care in two respects, the next question which must be answered is whether either or both of those breaches caused the damage suffered by the Church.
135  The test for causation in negligence is well known, as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke,  at paras. 18-28, . The general test for causation remains the "but for" test, which requires the plaintiff to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the damage would not have occurred but for the negligence of the defendant. A substantial connection must exist between the acts of the defendant and the fire.
136  Mr. Reed, who testified as an expert in causes and origins of fires, stated:
Had the combustible fascia, fibreboard, or wood framing at the edge of the membrane been adequately protected in the area in which the hot work operations were being conducted in accordance with the 1998 BCFC, the combustible components would not have been exposed to the flame and therefore the fire would not have occurred.
137  The defendant's argument is that the evidence is insufficient to establish that the fire at the Church was, in fact, caused by the torching activities and not, for example, by an electrical fire. The plaintiff, on the other hand, asserts that there is compelling circumstantial evidence: the defendant had care and control of the plaintiff's roof; the defendant's crew were working with a propane torch in the vicinity of combustible materials; and a roof fire is not something that in the ordinary course occurs under the management of a reasonably careful roofer taking adequate precautions. From this circumstantial evidence, the plaintiff asks this Court to draw an inference of negligence.
138  The New Brunswick Court of Appeal in Sisters of Charity of the Immaculate Conception v. Robert J. Fudge Ltd.  (C.A.), using the language of res ipsa loquitur, found it appropriate to draw an inference of negligence in similar factual circumstances.
139  However, in light of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Fontaine v. British Columbia (Official Administrator),  at para. 27, , the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is to be treated as a common sense approach to circumstantial evidence and is not to be applied in a formalistic way:
[27] It would appear that the law would be better served if the maxim was treated as expired and no longer used as a separate component in negligence actions. After all, it was nothing more than an attempt to deal with circumstantial evidence. That evidence is more sensibly dealt with by the trier of fact, who should weigh the circumstantial evidence with the direct evidence, if any, to determine whether the plaintiff has established on a balance of probabilities a prima facie case of negligence against the defendant. Once the plaintiff has done so, the defendant must present evidence negating that of the plaintiff or necessarily the plaintiff will succeed.
140  It is my view that based on the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, that this Court can draw the inference that Mr. Hutchings' negligence caused the fire by allowing the torch to ignite a smouldering fire, likely in the unprotected gap between the flat and the gable roof. While the defendant has advanced the theory that the possible cause of the fire was electrical, there is no evidence of that to rebut the plaintiff's prima facie case on a balance of probabilities.
Breach of Contract
141  The damages claimed for breach of contract would be duplicative of those claimed for negligence. Having found the defendant negligent and liable for those damages, it is unnecessary for this Court to consider the claim for breach of contract.
142  I would note however, that Mr. Fisher gave evidence that, without the fireproofing, the warranty of the roof through the manufacturer of the roofing material would be void and therefore a breach of contract would arise from the failure to supply the roof that was promised to the Church.
Conclusion
143  Having found that the defendant was negligent and that that negligence caused the fire at the Church, the defendant is liable for the damages agreed. I award the plaintiff <damage type = "total">$2,300,000</damage>, plus costs and interest under the Court Order Interest Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 79.
144  Should the parties wish to make submissions on the issue of costs, they may arrange a time to appear before me with the Registry.

Application by the defendant for a deduction of the accident benefits payable to the plaintiff from the award of damages, apportionment of costs payable to the plaintiff and costs arising from the plaintiff's rejection of offers to settle. In 2005, the then 20-year-old plaintiff was struck by the defendant's vehicle while she was a pedestrian in a marked crosswalk. The plaintiff, who suffered from cerebral palsy, claimed she suffered a traumatic brain injury and acceleration of physical deterioration that might have occurred in the future due to cerebral palsy. Her claim included claims for lost earning capacity and cost of future care totalling more than $2 million. After a 19-day trial in June 2012, a jury found the defendant 80 per cent liable for the plaintiff's injuries and assessed the plaintiff's total damages at <damage type = "total">$82,400</damage>. Damages were reduced to <damage type = "total after">$65,920</damage> based on the finding of contributory negligence. The defendant made two formal offers to settle. The first offer, made in April 2011 shortly before the first-scheduled trial date, was for <damage type = "other">$300,000</damage>. The second offer, made in April 2012, was for <damage type = "other">$700,000</damage>. The defendant sought deductions for rehabilitation benefits payable that the plaintiff was eligible to receive in the future under the Insurance (Vehicle) Act and Regulations including <damage type = "other">$22,155</damage> for future replacement hearing aids, <damage type = "other">$9,672</damage> for physiotherapy and <damage type = "other">$5,278</damage> for occupational therapy. 

HELD: Application allowed in part.
 The plaintiff conceded that the <damage type = "other">$20,000</damage> advance she received from the defendants and the <damage type = "other">$900</damage> she received from ICBC as total disability benefits must be deducted from the award. The defendant failed to prove that the plaintiff was entitled to the benefits for which the deduction was sought. The replacement hearing aids and related expenses were a discretionary benefit that ICBC was not bound to pay. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy were mandatory benefits, but only if they expenses were incurred as a result of the injury sustained in the accident. The plaintiff's costs were reduced to 80 per cent. As the defendant was successful on the issue of contributory negligence, there was no basis to depart from the usual rule set out in s. 3(1) of the Negligence Act that costs be in the same proportion as liability. As the plaintiff did not act unreasonably in rejecting the offers to settle given the medical evidence, she was entitled to her costs as if the offers had not been made.

Reasons for Judgment
N.H. SMITH J.
1   After a 19 day trial of this personal injury action, a jury found the defendant 80 per cent liable for the plaintiff's injuries, but awarded damages that will be less than 10 per cent of the defendant's most recent formal offer to settle.
2  The defendant now seeks a deduction from the award for benefits payable under the Part 7 of the Insurance (Vehicle) Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 231 [Act] regulations, Insurance (Vehicle) Regulation,  [Regulations], apportionment of the costs payable to the plaintiff, and costs arising from the plaintiff's rejection of offers to settle. The combined effect of these orders would probably leave the plaintiff with a liability for costs far in excess of her net judgment.
3  The plaintiff is now 27 years old and is a pre-school teacher/day care worker. She was 20 when she was struck by the defendant's car while she was a pedestrian in a marked crosswalk on November 27, 2005. In its verdict of June 21, 2012 the jury assessed the plaintiff's total damages at <damage type = "total">$82,400</damage>. The finding of 20 per cent contributory negligence will reduce that amount to <damage type = "total after">$65,920</damage>.
4  The defendant made two formal offers to settle. The first, for <damage type = "other">$300,000</damage>, was made on April 7, 2011, shortly before a then-scheduled trial date. The defendant then successfully applied for an adjournment of the trial, but was ordered, as a condition of the adjournment, to make an advance payment of <damage type = "other">$20,000</damage>. The second offer, made on April 26, 2012, was for <damage type = "other">$700,000</damage>, including the <damage type = "other">$20,000</damage> advance. The plaintiff's claim at trial included claims for lost earning capacity and cost of future care totalling more than <damage type = "other">$2 million</damage>.
5  In addition to liability, the major issues at trial were the extent of the plaintiff's traumatic brain injury and the significance of a pre-existing condition. The plaintiff was born with cerebral palsy, which, prior to the accident, affected her mobility, but not her mental functioning.
6  The plaintiff contended that she had suffered a severe and permanent brain injury, as well as acceleration of physical deterioration that might have occurred in the future due to cerebral palsy. The defendant agreed the plaintiff suffered a brain injury, but said she recovered well from it and any continuing symptoms are subtle and relatively mild. As for any physical problems the plaintiff may have now or in the future, the defendant said these are part of the ordinary process of cerebral palsy and are unrelated to the accident. There was no dispute that the plaintiff also suffered a moderate left-side hearing loss, which was related to her head injury and skull fracture.
Part 7 Deductions
7  The plaintiff concedes that the $20,000 advance must be deducted from the award, along with $900.90 that the plaintiff received from the Insurance Corporation of B.C. ("ICBC" or the "corporation") as total disability benefits. The defendant seeks a further deduction of $37,104.20, representing rehabilitation benefits he says the plaintiff is eligible to receive in the future. That deduction, along with those agreed to, would reduce the plaintiff's net award, before any consideration of costs, to $7,914.90.
8  The jury's assessment of damages included $36,100 for the cost of future care. That was far less than even the amount suggested by the defendant's expert on the cost of future care, to say nothing of the plaintiff's expert, so it is impossible to know what future expenses the jury accepted. The jury accepted almost all of the plaintiff's claim for special costs, which included some past physiotherapy treatment.
9  The Act and the Regulations made under it provide for payment of certain medical and rehabilitation benefits. Where a plaintiff has been awarded a judgment for cost of future care, deductions are to be made for benefits the plaintiff has received or is entitled to receive under that scheme. Section 83(2) of the Act reads:
A person who has a claim for damages and who receives or is entitled to receive benefits respecting the loss on which the claim is based, is deemed to have released the claim to the extent of the benefits.
(This action is governed by a previous statute that was in force at the time of the accident, but the relevant provisions are substantially the same.)
10  The benefits to which s. 83 refers are benefits prescribed under Part 7 of the Regulations, including s. 88, which reads in part:
88 (1) Where an insured is injured in an accident for which benefits are provided under this Part, the corporation shall, subject to subsections (5) and (6), pay as benefits all reasonable expenses incurred by the insured as a result of the injury for necessary medical, surgical, dental, hospital, ambulance or professional nursing services, or for necessary physical therapy, chiropractic treatment, occupational therapy or speech therapy or for prosthesis or orthosis.
...
Where, in the opinion of the corporation's medical adviser, provision of any one or more of the following is likely to promote the rehabilitation of an insured who is injured in an accident for which benefits are provided under this Part, the corporation may provide any one or more of the following:
...
reimbursement to the insured for costs incurred from time to time by the insured for the purchase and reasonable repair, adjustment or replacement of one or more of the following items:
...
aids for communication, dressing, eating, grooming and hygiene;
...
The corporation is not liable to pay for more than 12 physical therapy treatments for an insured for each accident unless, before any additional treatment is given, the corporation's medical advisor or the insured's medical practitioner certifies to the corporation in writing that, in his opinion, the treatment is necessary for the insured.
11  Some benefits are mandatory under s. 88 (1), while others are discretionary under s. 88 (2). In Li v. Newson,  at para 14, Abrioux J. summarized some of the governing principles relevant to an application for deduction of benefits:
the defendant bears the onus of proving that the plaintiff is entitled to the benefits which the defendant seeks to deduct;
strict compliance with the statute is required;
uncertainty as to whether a Part 7 benefit will be paid must be resolved in favour of the plaintiff;
the ability to make the deduction is not dependant on the actual receipt of benefits by the plaintiff. Issues between the plaintiff and ICBC regarding the benefits are not relevant to the deductibility by a tort-feasor from an award to the plaintiff;
it is no longer a requirement that there be a match between the heads of damage for a tort award and specific heads of damages under the benefit recovery scheme;
the task of the court is to estimate the amount of Part 7 benefits, if any, the plaintiff is or would be entitled to receive for the costs reflected in the future care award. It then must make the appropriate deduction;
benefits under s. 88 (2) of the Regulations arise when ICBC's medical adviser holds the opinion that the costs are "likely to promote the rehabilitation" of the plaintiff. The term "rehabilitation" is defined in s. 78 of the Regulation as follows:
"Rehabilitation" means the restoration, in the shortest practical time, of an injured person to the highest level of gainful employment or self-sufficiency that, allowing for the permanent effects of his injuries, is, with medical and vocational assistance, reasonably achievable by him.
the uncertainty of the entitlement of payment created by the Regulation may lead the court to conclude that only a nominal deduction is appropriate. Trial judges must be cautious in their approach to determining the estimate inasmuch as a reduction results in a lessening of the award in the tort action. If that is a result of uncertainty created by the Regulation, ICBC cannot be heard to complain;
the court is to take into account ICBC's discretion with respect to whether certain amounts will be paid in addition to restrictions in the Regulation with respect to amounts payable.
12  The deductions sought by the defendant are for future replacement hearing aids and related expenses ($22,155), physiotherapy ($9,672) and occupational therapy ($5,278). Those figures are based on the recommendations contained in the report of the defendant's future care expert and the present value of those recommendations as calculated by the defendant's economic expert. The total present value of the defendant's expert's care recommendations was <damage type = "other">$127,169</damage>.
13  The replacement hearing aids and related expenses are a discretionary benefit under s. 88(2). The defendant has provided an affidavit from an ICBC claims examiner who says that the corporation paid for a hearing aid on one occasion, in January 2007, and who says: "I expect ICBC will continue to re-imburse reasonable incurred hearing aid expenses".
14  The examiner's stated expectation falls far short of the evidence required. Before discretionary benefits can be paid, s. 88(2) requires an opinion from "the corporation's medical advisor". No evidence from any such person has been put forward. The expert who provided a care opinion for the defendant at trial is an occupational therapist. There is no evidence that ICBC accepts her in the capacity of its "medical advisor" for purposes of s. 88.
15  Although the opinion of a medical advisor is a precondition to the payment of discretionary benefits, the corporation is still not bound to pay them. The examiner's expectation is no more than an opinion about what his employer will do in the future. There is no evidence that he has the authority to make that decision and no explanation of the basis on which he feels able to express an opinion on what the corporation will do for the remainder of the plaintiff's life.
16  Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are mandatory benefits under s. 88(1), but only if the expenses are incurred "as a result of the injury" sustained in an accident. That must be read in conjunction with s. 96, which reads:
The corporation is not liable to pay benefits under this Part in respect of the injury or death of a person
...
whose injury or death is caused, directly or indirectly, by sickness or disease, unless the sickness or disease was contracted as a direct result of an accident for which benefits are provided under this Part.
17  The Regulations would therefore permit the corporation to refuse to pay these expenses on the basis that the need for them arose from the plaintiff's pre-existing cerebral palsy, not from the injury suffered in the accident. That position would be entirely consistent with what the defendant argued, with apparent success, at trial.
18  At this stage of the proceeding, I believe it is appropriate to acknowledge the fact that in cases such as this the corporation has conduct of the defence on behalf of its insured. There is certainly no evidence that the corporation now disavows the position it instructed counsel to take at trial.
19  Accordingly, I find that the defendant has failed to meet the onus of proving the plaintiff is entitled to the benefits for which deduction has been sought.
Apportionment of Costs
20  The defendant seeks an order that the plaintiff receive only 80 per cent of her costs, reflecting the division of liability. This arises from s. 3(1) of the Negligence Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 333:
3 (1) Unless the court otherwise directs, the liability for costs of the parties to every action is in the same proportion as their respective liability to make good the damage or loss.
21  Although payment of costs in proportion to the degree of liability is the default rule, the court has discretion to depart from it. That departure must be for reasons connected with the case, with the principle consideration being whether application of the usual rule will result in an injustice: Moses v. Kim,  at para 70.
22  In Moses the plaintiff was found to be 65 per cent at fault for an accident and was awarded damages of <damage type = "other">$218,050</damage>, which was about a quarter of what he had sought and a third of the total assessed at trial. The trial judge awarded the plaintiff 90 per cent of his taxable costs. The factors considered by the trial judge included the severity of the plaintiff's injuries, the defendant's denial of liability, the amount of damages, the plaintiff's legal fees and the fact that only one day of evidence and one-half day of argument in a nine-day trial was devoted to the issue of liability.
23  The Court of Appeal reduced the recovery of costs to 75 per cent, saying that the trial judge erred in considering the plaintiff's legal fees as well as in failing to consider the defendant's success on contributory negligence.
24  In Bourelle v. Andrychuk  (BCCA), a jury found the plaintiff 90 per cent at fault. The trial judge awarded the plaintiff 100 per cent of his costs. The Court of Appeal reduced that to two-thirds, based on the division of trial time between liability and damages issues.
25  In Burdett (Guardian ad litem of) v. Mohamed, , a jury awarded damages of <damage type = "other">$1.8 million</damage>, after a 20 per cent reduction for contributory negligence. Boyd J. awarded the plaintiff 90 per cent of taxable costs, and 100 per cent of most disbursements but only 80 per cent of disbursements related to liability.
26  A common feature of all of these cases is that the plaintiff had substantial success in proving injury and damages. Based on the jury's verdict, that cannot be said to be the case here. In those circumstances, I cannot ignore the defendant's success on the contributory negligence issue and can find no basis on which to depart from the usual rule set out in s. 3(1) of the Negligence Act.
Offers to Settle
27  Rule 9-1 of the Supreme Court Civil Rules provides for pre-trial offers to settle, which the court may later consider when exercising its discretion in relation to costs. Rules 9-1(5) and (6) read:
In a proceeding in which an offer to settle has been made, the court may do one or more of the following:
deprive a party of any or all of the costs, including any or all of the disbursements, to which the party would otherwise be entitled in respect of all or some of the steps taken in the proceeding after the date of delivery or service of the offer to settle;
award double costs of all or some of the steps taken in the proceeding after the date of delivery or service of the offer to settle;
award to a party, in respect of all or some of the steps taken in the proceeding after the date of delivery or service of the offer to settle, costs to which the party would have been entitled had the offer not been made;
if the offer was made by a defendant and the judgment awarded to the plaintiff was no greater than the amount of the offer to settle, award to the defendant the defendant's costs in respect of all or some of the steps taken in the proceeding after the date of delivery or service of the offer to settle. [am. B.C. Reg. 119/2010, Sch. A, s. 21.]
In making an order under subrule (5), the court may consider the following:
whether the offer to settle was one that ought reasonably to have been accepted, either on the date that the offer to settle was delivered or served or on any later date;
the relationship between the terms of settlement offered and the final judgment of the court;
the relative financial circumstances of the parties;
any other factor the court considers appropriate.
28  Rule 9-1 is identical in wording and effect to former R. 37B, which in turn replaced a rule under which a plaintiff's failure to obtain a judgment in excess of an offer to settle resulted in mandatory costs consequences. The current rule gives the court "what is clearly intended to be an unfettered discretion": Bailey v. Jang,  at para 19.
29  The underlying purpose of the rule is to encourage settlement by rewarding the party who makes a reasonable offer and penalizing the party who declines to accept such an offer: AE (Litigation guardian of) v. DWJ,  at para 61, aff'd . In Dempsey v. Oh,  at para 19, it is made clear that "[i]t is not the court's function to ensure that a plaintiff makes a net recovery from an action when it has ignored a reasonable offer." However, this Court has said that "one should be cautious, with the advantage of hindsight, in equating having guessed wrongly with having been unreasonable in rejecting an offer": Lumanlan v. Sadler,  at para 35; Fan v. Chana,  at para 19.
30  Some of the factors the court may consider in exercising its discretion are set out in R. 9-1(6). The first of these--and, in my view, the most important in this case--is whether the offer ought reasonably to have been accepted. In Hartshorne v. Hartshorne,  the Court of Appeal said at para 27:
The first factor - whether the offer to settle was one that ought reasonably to have been accepted - is not determined by reference to the award that was ultimately made. Rather, in considering that factor, the court must determine whether, at the time that the offer was open for acceptance, it would have been reasonable for it to have been accepted: Bailey v. Jang, ,  at para. 24; A.E. v. D.W.J. at para. 55. As was said in A.E. v. D.W.J., "The reasonableness of the plaintiff's decision not to accept the offer to settle must be assessed without reference to the court's decision" (para. 55). Instead, the reasonableness is to be assessed by considering such factors as the timing of the offer, whether it had some relationship to the claim (as opposed to simply being a "nuisance offer"), whether it could be easily evaluated, and whether some rationale for the offer was provided. We do not intend this to be a comprehensive list, nor do we suggest that each of these factors will necessarily be relevant in a given case.
31  One test that has been applied on this question is whether "reasonable counsel aware of all of the evidence in this case but unaware of the jury award ought to have encouraged the plaintiff to accept the offer at the time it was made": Khunkhun v. Titus,  at para 25.
32  In order to determine whether an offer is reasonable and ought to be accepted, the plaintiff must be able to consider it in relation to the evidence expected at trial and the apparent range of possible outcomes. In a personal injury case, that exercise usually includes consideration of conflicting medical opinions, along with the possibility and likely consequences of the court preferring certain opinions over others. Plaintiff's counsel who is relying on an opinion from Dr. X can advise his or her client of the reduction in damages that may result from the court rejecting the evidence of Dr. X and accepting the opinion of Dr. Y that is being relied on by the defendant.
33  In this case, the evidence relied on by the plaintiff included opinions of a neuroradiologist, a neuropsychologist, a psychiatrist, an otolaryngologist and two physiatrists. The only experts put forward by the defendant on the question of damages were the occupational therapist dealing with cost of future care and the economist. The defendant served no medical expert opinions, although the plaintiff had attended two independent medical examinations at the request of defence counsel.
34  The onus of proof at trial is on the plaintiff. The defendant is under no obligation to produce medical evidence and may rely entirely on cross-examination of the plaintiff and the plaintiff's medical experts to support an argument that the plaintiff has failed to prove damages. That is what defence counsel chose to do in this case, apparently with great success.
35  But the onus of proof at trial is not necessarily relevant to the question of whether an offer made before trial "had some relationship to the claim" or "could be easily evaluated". In choosing to defend this case in the way he did, the defendant also chose not to provide the plaintiff with evidence on which she could judge the reasonableness of the offers to settle. With the plaintiff's medical reports in hand, and in the absence of contrary medical opinions, I do not see how reasonable counsel could have recommended acceptance of either of the defendant's offers or justified such a recommendation to the plaintiff.
36  A second factor for consideration set out in R. 9-1(6) is the relationship between the offer and the final judgment. However, the court cautioned against putting too much weight on this factor in cases involving jury trials, given the unpredictability of jury awards: Smagh v. Bumbrah,  at paras 13-14.
37  In this case, I find the consideration under R. 9-1(6)(a) to be determinative. I am not only unable to say the offers ought reasonably to have been accepted, but I find that they could not reasonably have been accepted in the context of the evidentiary vacuum in which they were presented. I conclude the plaintiff is entitled to her costs as if the offers had not been made.
Conclusion
38  After deductions in respect of contributory negligence, the advance and total disability benefits, the plaintiff will have judgment for <damage type = "total after">$45,019.10</damage>, plus 80 per cent of her taxable costs and disbursements.

Action by the owners, Salgado and Calcaneo, against Toth for damages for negligent misrepresentation and negligence. The owners purchased a house consisting of an A-frame structure built during the early 1960s and an addition that was constructed in the late 1980s. The house was on a steep sloping lot. They agreed to pay <damage type = "other">$1,095,000</damage> for the property, and the agreement was "subject to an inspection report and bank approval to the Buyers' satisfaction on or before five week days after acceptance." The owners retained Toth and his company, HomePro Inspections, to prepare an inspection report for the property. Toth inspected the house and provided both a written and a verbal report to the owners. He received <damage type = "other">$450</damage> for his services. The owners alleged that Toth breached his duty of care by failing to inspect all of the A-frame beams for rot and moisture, by failing to fully advise them regarding the extent of the structural problems relating to the house, and by failing to advise the owners to retain a structural engineer. They further alleged that Toth made various statements regarding the cost of correcting the problems that he found (<damage type = "other">$20,000</damage>), and that the statements amounted to negligent misrepresentation. Toth denied the allegations, and relied on his contract with the owners to limit his liability. Salgado did not read the contract before signing it. The parties agreed that the cost of the work to remedy the problems with the house totalled <damage type = "total">$192,920</damage>. 

HELD: Action in negligence allowed and owners awarded damages of <damage type = "total">$192,920</damage>.
 Toth was negligent in his inspection of the horizontal and vertical beams on both sides of the house. He also was negligent in not inspecting the east side beams, and in his inspection of the west side beams by either inspecting only two and not advising the owners that he had only done so, or by not drawing to their attention that the rot was much more widespread than he indicated to them. His breaches of duty of care caused the owners to suffer damages. But for the negligent act and/or the omission, the damages would not have occurred as the owners would not have purchased the property if the full extent of the rot on the east and west side beams of the house had been known and brought to their attention. Toth was negligent in not recommending a geotechnical review of the property and by not clearly presenting the significance of the problems he observed. Toth owed the owners a duty of care, and this duty was not met because he did not recommend to the owners that they should consult a geotechnical engineer prior to deciding whether to proceed with the purchase of the property. The owners relied upon the advice received from Toth before deciding whether they would remove the subject clauses contained within the contract and proceed to purchase the property. As a result of the owners' reliance on the advice received from Toth regarding the stability of the house, the owners proceeded to purchase the property and suffered damages as a result of that purchase. Toth's repair estimate was woefully inadequate. While damages were not available to the owners as a result of this negligent misrepresentation of the likely cost of the structural changes that were required in order to provide stability for the house because the owners did not rely on this misrepresentation to their detriment, the estimate gave considerable solace to the owners that the structural expenditures would not be excessive and, therefore, the structural problems were not significant. The owners were entitled to the actual cost of the structural changes which were required, including engineering costs, less the estimate provided by Toth. It was incumbent upon Toth to draw to the attention of Salgado the exclusion and waiver clauses in the contract and to take reasonable steps to apprise Salgado of the onerous terms and to ensure that he read and understood them. The doctrine of contra proferentem applied and any "guarantee or warranty, express or implied" related to the adequacy, performance or condition of any inspected structure, item or system at the time of the inspection was not excluded by the limitation of liability paragraph.

Reasons for Judgment
G.D. BURNYEAT J.
1   The Plaintiffs purchased a property in North Vancouver having a building lot that had a steep slope along the southern perimeter of the lot ("Property") and a house consisting of an A-frame structure built during the early 1960s and an addition that was constructed in the late 1980s ("House").
2  The former owners listed the Property for sale during the summer of 2006 at a listing price of <damage type = "other">$1,195,000.00</damage>. By a September 15, 2006 contract of purchase and sale ("Agreement"), the Plaintiffs agreed to pay <damage type = "other">$1,095,000.00</damage> for the Property with the purchase to complete on October 27, 2006. The Agreement was "subject to an inspection report and bank approval to the Buyers' satisfaction on or before 5 week days after acceptance".
3  At the recommendation of their real estate agent, the Plaintiffs retained the Defendants, Imre Toth and 659279 B.C. Ltd. doing business as HomePro Inspections ("Mr. Toth") to prepare an inspection report for the Property. Mr. Toth came to the Property, inspected the House, and provided both a written and a verbal report to the Plaintiffs. Mr. Toth received <damage type = "other">$450.50</damage> for his services.
4  The Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Toth made certain statements about the cost of repairing the Property and that those representations constitute negligent misrepresentations that were relied upon by the Plaintiffs. At the same time, the Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Toth conducted the inspection of the Property in a negligent manner and failed to identify and warn the Plaintiffs of a number of material defects. Mr. Toth denies those allegations, and, in any event, relies on his contract with the Plaintiffs to limit any liability that he might have.
5  The Plaintiffs have settled with the Defendants, Grahame Harold Shannon and Shirley Yap Shannon, who were the former owners, have discontinued their action against Alfredo Lavaggi and Sussex Realty Corporation, carrying on business as Prudential Sussex Realty and the said Sussex Realty Corporation, and have discontinued their action against the District of North Vancouver and Cesar Parayno, an engineer. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs do not seek from the Defendants any damages or other relief for any portion of the loss, damage or expense alleged which may be attributed to the fault of those Defendants and expressly waive any right in this Action to recover from the Defendants, Imre Toth and 659279 B.C. Ltd., any amount which the other Defendants would be liable to indemnify Imre Toth and 659279 B.C. Ltd. in third party proceedings.
6  By agreement, the parties accept that the cost of remedial work to remedy certain problems with the House totals <damage type = "other">$192,920.45, made up as follows: (a) "A" Frame Beams -- west side of the House (<damage type = "other">$35,000.00</damage>); (b) "A" Frame Beams -- east side of the House (<damage type = "other">$18,800.00</damage>); (c) Stabilization of House (<damage type = "other">$56,800.00</damage>); (d) Engineering (<damage type = "other">$26,269.00</damage>, comprised of costs incurred to date of <damage type = "other">$16,269.00</damage>, and estimated future costs of <damage type = "other">$10,000.00</damage>); (e) West side deck removal (<damage type = "other">$9,360.00</damage>); (f) replacement of the west deck (<damage type = "other">$24,100.00</damage>); and (g) a shoring up of the east deck (<damage type = "other">$11,500.00</damage>).
7  With G.S.T. of <damage type = "other">$9,091.45</damage>, and a contingency of <damage type = "other">$22,000.00</damage>, the total cost of the required remedial work is <damage type = "other">$212,920.45</damage>. From that amount, the Plaintiffs subtract the <damage type = "other">$20,000.00</damage> that Mr. Toth estimated the remedial work would cost and claim <damage type = "other">$192,920.45</damage>, as well as pre-judgment interest and Scale "B" costs.
BACKGROUND
8  Alfredo Lavaggi was a realtor who was contacted by the Plaintiffs. Mr. Lavaggi introduced the Property to the Plaintiffs and acted as their agent with respect to the purchase of the Property.
9  At the recommendation of Mr. Lavaggi, Mr. Toth was requested to prepare a home inspection report. Mr. Toth inspected the Property and House on September 21, 2006. In accordance with his testimony at Trial, I find that Mr. Toth took about 30 minutes to inspect the roof and the "rest of the exterior of the House". I make no conclusions about how long Mr. Toth spent to inspect the interior of the House.
10  After completing his inspection, Mr. Toth met with the Plaintiffs, discussed what was in the written part of his report, discussed other matters about the Property and the House with the Plaintiffs, and received payment from the Plaintiffs for providing his services. Sometime during that meeting, a contract with the Defendant, 659279 BC Ltd. doing business as HomePro Inspections, was signed by Mr. Salgado ("Contract"). Ms. Calcaneo did not sign the Contract. While the Contract defines "659279 BC Ltd. dba HomePro Inspections" as the "Inspector", the Contract is signed by Mr. Toth in a space above the words: "INSPECTOR IMRE TOTH 659279 BC LTD. HOMEPRO INSPECTIONS".
11  After receiving the written and verbal report of Mr. Toth, Mr. Salgado phoned Mr. Lavaggi to discuss what he had been told. At his March 12, 2008 Examination for Discovery, Mr. Lavaggi was asked the following questions and gave the following answers:
But he [Mr. Salgado] might have said there's a reference here to a structural problem?
He did mention, as I said to you before, that he was told there was structural and foundation problems.
Did he indicate to you what the extent of those problems were? Other than --
He talked about it and that they were major, that they were significant.
Did he say what the dollar value of the problem was?
I don't recall.
12  The Plaintiffs removed the subject clauses on the Agreement, the purchase in the name of both Plaintiffs completed on schedule, and the Plaintiffs took possession of the Property.
THE CONTRACT
13  The Contract signed by Mr. Salgado on September 21, 2006 contained a number of provisions, including the following (capitalization and bold print as set out in the Contract):
The INSPECTOR will perform a VISUAL INSPECTION of the readily accessible and visible areas of the major systems and components of the Primary Residence on the Property and certain built-in equipment and improvements. The inspection and report are not intended to reflect on the market value of the Property nor to make any recommendation as to the advisability of purchase.
The condition of certain systems, components and equipment will be randomly sampled by the inspector. Examples of such systems, components and equipment are window/door operation and hardware, electrical receptacles, switches and lights, cabinet/countertop mounts and functions, insulation depth, mortar, masonry, paint and caulking integrity and roof covering materials. Furniture, rugs, appliances, stored items, etc. will not be moved for the inspection.
The INSPECTOR will give a professional opinion on whether those items inspected are performing their intended function at the time of the inspection or are in need of immediate repair. The inspection and report are based upon observations of conditions that exist at the time the inspection was performed.
Cost estimates, if provided, are "ballpark" estimates only and are not intended to be relied upon by any person for accuracy. The CLIENT should obtain written bids from qualified licensed contractors in order to determine the possible cost of repairs.
This inspection is performed in accordance with the Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice of the Canadian Association of Home and Property Inspectors (CAHPI), a copy of which is attached to this report.
The Client is encouraged to participate in the visual inspection process and accepts responsibility for the consequences of electing not to do so, i.e. incomplete information being available to the Inspector. This Client's participation shall be at the Client's own risk for injuries, falls, property damage, etc;
9. THE INSPECTION AND REPORT ARE NOT INTENDED NOR ARE TO BE USED AS A GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE FUTURE ADEQUACY, PERFORMANCE OR CONDITION OF ANY INSPECTED STRUCTURE, ITEM OR SYSTEM. THE INSPECTOR IS NOT AN INSURER OF ANY INSPECTED CONDITIONS.
It is understood and agreed that should the INSPECTOR be found liable for any loss or damages resulting from a failure to perform any obligations, including but not limited to negligence, breach of contract, or otherwise, then the liability of the INSPECTOR shall be limited to a sum equal to the amount of the fee paid by the CLIENT for the Inspection and Report.
In the event that the CLIENT claims damages against the INSPECTOR and does not prove those damages, the CLIENT shall pay all legal fees, arbitrator/mediator fees, legal expenses and costs by the INSPECTOR in defence of the claim.
By signing the Property Inspection Contract, the CLIENT acknowledges, covenants and agrees that:
The CLIENT understands and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this contract;
The INSPECTOR has not made any representations or warranties other than those contained in the Contract;
The TOTAL fee payable at the time of the visual inspection of the Subject Property shall be <damage type = "other">$450.50</damage>.
The CLIENT shall pay the fees described above to the inspector without set-off or deduction.
14  At Trial, Mr. Toth stated that he understood that the Plaintiffs would be available at 12:00 noon on the 21st so that he could provide them with his "presentation" regarding the inspection. The Plaintiffs did not arrive as Mr. Toth anticipated:
I cannot recall exactly the time when they arrived. And I believe I expressed my frustration, because we agreed upon a time, and I felt ignored and disrespectfully treated, so I was having quite a ... [frustrating] time. I expressed them I have other things to do than waiting for people, and I scheduled this, as I told, my presentation between 12:00 and 1:00, and I have other things to do. And that was what I said, and then I started discussing the report.
15  At his December 26, 2008, Examination for Discovery, Mr. Salgado stated that he arrived at the Property at about 12:30. I conclude that the presentation of Mr. Toth took between 30 and 45 minutes, and, in addition to the written and verbal report provided by Mr. Toth, Mr. Toth and the Plaintiffs visited some of the areas within the House during that time. At Trial, Mr. Toth was asked how long he spent after the presentation of the written and verbal report going through the House with the Plaintiffs and he stated: "15, 20 or more minutes after the structural presentation."
16  At Trial, Mr. Toth stated that his contract would usually be signed by both parties at the beginning of the inspection if all parties were present but, if not present, then at the time before the inspection was discussed. At Trial, Mr. Toth stated that it was his "usual practice" that approximately 99% of his written report was "fully blank until the presentation with my client starts", but that, if the client was not present, then "for time management and killing the empty time", he would fill in most if not all of the written portion of his report prior to the client being present. Mr. Toth stated that the Contract was signed before any kind of presentation on September 21, 2006. I find that the Contract was signed after virtually all of the written portion of the report was added to the report.
17  At his October 17, 2007 Examination for Discovery, Mr. Toth stated that he completed the report, invited the Plaintiffs to sit down, and then "... introduced this inspection report system". At Trial, Mr. Toth stated that, after Mr. Salgado filled in his name and address on the Contract, he then said to Mr. Salgado:
This is the property inspection contract. Opening the book, showing the contract, I told, in Canada, every home inspection conducted by a member of the national association has to have this written agreement signed. I did my part. I'm asking him to review it and fill the top part and sign it at the bottom. He reviewed it and then signed it, filled it and signed it.
Since I'm not sure my clients how much they understanding or reading from my contract, this is my standard practice, to briefly point out three major elements. I'm calling them three major elements. Is the number 1 is inspection -- this regarding to the scope of inspection, sentences 1 to 4. I briefly summarizing those section as the nature of my inspection is visual inspection. ...
And then second cornerstone or significant information is I'm following the standard of practice and code of ethics ... and that was the 5 and 6. And I called the so-called sentence number 9 printed in bold capital lettering, I named it as a third major information, it telling inspection is not an insurance policy, not a warranty or assuring or one of the -- any conditions. This is a standard no matter how much time my clients spending reading or not reading, I'm pointing always out these three areas.
WRITTEN REPORT
18  The written report prepared by Mr. Toth started with a "The Big Picture/Summary" page. The form of report was prepared by Mr. Toth after consulting with a lawyer and after incorporating the recommended contract form of the Canadian Association of Home and Property Inspectors of B.C. ("CAHPI (BC)"). The "Big Picture/Summary" page set out eight separate areas of the inspection, rating each of the eight sections as average, above average or below average, as well as setting out "major points of concern", setting out "significant qualities", and setting out whether "major/minor repairs" were "recommended".
19  The rating for "STRUCTURE" was half-way between "average" and "below", and all of the words "Major/Minor Repairs Recommended" were underlined. The ELECTRIC, PLUMBING, KITCHEN and EXTERIOR are all rated as "Average". The "HEATING/VENTILATION/AC" and the "INTERIOR" were rated as between average and above average. The "UNDER HOUSE SPACE" was also rated as between above average and average. Minor repairs were recommended for the "ELECTRIC" and "minor repairs and maintenance" were "Recommended" for the PLUMBING and ELECTRIC components. Maintenance was recommended for the HEATING/VENTILATION/AC COMPONENT. The "SIGNIFICANT QUALITIES" were noted as being "200 A service", "Newer furnace", and "Well maintained clean interior". The "MAJOR POINTS OF CONCERN" for the "STRUCTURE" were described as follows: "To fix-up structural deficiencies". The comments under the headings "MAJOR POINTS OF CONCERN" and "SIGNIFICANT QUALITIES" were handwritten onto the report form. The next part of the written report dealt with each of the eight components and comprised two pages for each of the eight components.
20  On the first page for the component "STRUCTURE", the following was noted:
21  The only marks or words that were not on the printed form were the question mark after the word "ongoing" and the words "South SW" after the word "Yes". There was a check mark beside the printed words: "check with professional engineering/pest control contractor or _________ for complete information".
22  The printed heading on the next page dealing with STRUCTURE, was: "SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES". On this page, there were number of printed "Descriptions". There was a column where a tick mark could be placed to indicate that a particular description applied, a second column to write in the "Location" where the description applied, and two columns to allow tick marks to be added to indicate whether "Repair" or "Upgrade" or both were suggested. The following printed descriptions had tick marks beside them, with the Location, Repair and/or Upgrade columns as noted:
Unstable soil conditions/erosions (location being "S, SW", and "repairs" and "upgrade" ticked);
Solitary foundation movements (location being "S side, deck, SW (?), and "repairs" ticked;
Floor sag (location being SW living rm (bsmt) settled to South", but without "repair" or "upgrade" ticked); and
Wood deck unstable, lateral support missing (with both "repair" and "upgrade" ticked).
23  In addition to those descriptions that were printed on the form, the following additional comments were handwritten in by Mr. Toth:
"Wood decks 6x6 posts have no bracing in any directions, new braces must be added. N side framing (posts and beam) moved, doesn't support the deck any more. Raise the top of beam to support joists."
"SW deck structure solitary foundations have major settlements, post base soil connection structure has no proper connection to house. To lift-up, and reinforce foundation & posts. "
"Two West side timber rafters near foundations are decayed, water damaged. "
"SE corner of garage conc. structure cracked. "
For each of (a), (b) and (c), the "repair" column was ticked but the "upgrade" column was not.
24  The other seven areas of inspection contained somewhat unimportant notations on the two printed pages for each of the seven separate areas of the inspection:
"UNDER HOUSE SPACE" - "mouse droppings in furnace rm." (with the "SIGNIFICANT UNDER HOUSE DEFICIENCIES" being noted as "Occasional seepage possible, to drain backyard!" and "Property grading pooling water against house -- N. side (backyard)", with both noting a suggested "Upgrade");
"ELECTRICAL" with the "SIGNIFICANT ELECTRICAL DEFICIENCIES" notations "Wires/boxes uncovered/loose -- Furnace rm, Exterior E" and "Tree branches/vines interfering with cable", with both noted as requiring "Repair";
"PLUMBING" -- a number of repairs were recommended, but nothing of a particularly significant nature;
"HEATING/VENTILATION/AIR CONDITIONING" (with the only "SIGNIFICANT H/V/AC DEFICIENCIES" being "Fireplace damper warped, not closing -- Family rm");
"KITCHEN" had two matters noted: "Refrigerator handle loose" and "Countertops have swollen joints";
"INTERIOR" was a notation "Mouse droppings in furnace room". There were a number of "SIGNIFICANT INTERIOR DEFICIENCIES" noted but none that bear on the questions between the parties involving this litigation;
"EXTERIOR", the "SIGNIFICANT EXTERIOR DEFICIENCIES" were noted as: "Retaining wall has no weep holes, add new, drill drains in conc. wall along stair", "Finished grading high, lowering 6" below siding required -- NE, E", "Yard has no proper drainage pooling rain water -- N patio area", "Debris to remove from E side", and "50% of garage roof, 100% of N overhang roof, 90% of walkway roof, ponding water, new drainage recommended at low points". Upgrades were recommended for all those "deficiencies".
25  After the first significant rainfall, the Plaintiffs noted leakage from the roof above the area that had been established as a family room. As a result, repairs were made to the roof. The Plaintiffs had discussions with a contractor who provided them with estimates of what it would cost to undertake the repairs of the areas in the report of Mr. Toth that required attention. The Plaintiffs also had William E. Clayton undertake an inspection of the Property.
REPORT OF WILLIAM E. CLAYTON
26  Mr. Clayton went to the Property in mid-December 2006 and undertook a cursory inspection. That involved taking no notes but taking photographs which are in evidence. The photographs taken in December 2006 clearly show well-established rot in a number of the A-frame members. While the written report of Mr. Toth had indicated: "Two West side timber rafters near foundation are decayed, water damaged" and while Mr. Toth did not inspect the structural members on the east side of the A-frame part of the House as he did not attempt to access a room which housed the east side structural members, Mr. Clayton found substantial problems with almost all of the A-frame beams.
27  At Trial, Mr. Clayton was qualified to provide an expert opinion regarding home inspections and the responsibility of home inspectors. His May 13, 2009 opinion was in evidence. In that opinion, he was asked the following questions and provided the following answers:
A-frame Beams
 Q1.  Please advise if there is any material difference in the state of the structure since your inspection of the structure in November or December of 2006." 
 A1.  Since my inspection on 17 December 2006, the rot conditions in all visible portions of the A-frame members appear to have progressed and are more extensive. At the time of my 2006 inspection, the rot appeared to be well established. 
 Q2.  "Please examine the balance of the exposed A-frame rafters on the west side of the house and advise whether or not they are also in need of repair." 
 A2.  I examined all the exposed A-frame members on the west side of the house May 5th and advise that, in my opinion, all of the members, except the first one at the northwest corner, need extensive repairs and replacement of the majority of the exposed exterior portions. 
 Q3.  "Please examine that portion of the structure [the horizontal beam at the south end of the A-frame structure] and advise as whether or not it is need of repair." 
 A3.  I inspected the southernmost beam in the crawlspace. It is in an advanced state of rot. My knife easily penetrated 3" into the members. Water was weeping out of the wood. There were numerous fungal organisms growing on the wood members. In my opinion, these members will need to be replaced as they cannot be repaired. 
 Q4.  "Please describe the state of the A-frame rafter on the East side and advise whether or not they are in need of repair." 
 A4.  Examination of the east side, southernmost A-frame reveals extensive rot immediately above the deck. It appears that an attempt has been made in the past to cover-up the condition or hide the condition - possibly before the last time the house was painted. In my opinion, repairs are required. 
"Once the house inspector determined that two of the rafters were rotten, what steps should the house inspector have taken, what should the house inspector have reported to the client and what recommendations should the house inspector have made to the client."
In my opinion, a prudent inspector in this market place at that time, would have checked the condition of all of the similar structural members and reported the condition in writing and in discussion with the client and would most likely have physically shown the client the condition. A prudent inspector would have recommended that a (structural) engineer, experienced in heavy timber construction be engaged to review the condition and make further recommendations with respect to repair and costs for repairs.
"In order to be consistent with the standards in the industry, what steps would a house inspector take with respect to the inspection of the A-frame rafters on the East side of the A-frame structure, particularly given the fact that he had identified two of the rafters on the West side of the structure as being rotten."
The standards used by Mr. Toth and referred to in his Property Inspection Contract are the Canadian Association of Home and Property Inspectors (CAHPI) Standards of Practice. Those Standards only require that the inspector inspect and probe "... a representative number of structural components where deterioration is suspected or where clear indications of possible deterioration exist."
In spite of the conditions imposed by the Standards, and as explained in A5(a) above, I believe that a prudent inspector would have inspected and reported on all of the A-frame members, not just some of them as required by the Standards.
Stability of House
 Q2.  "Given those observations, in order to be consistent with the standards in the industry, what steps would a house inspector take and what would be reported to the client and recommended to the client? In this regard, please make whatever comments you deem appropriate with respect to the reference in the house inspection report prepared by Mr. Toth to settlement and advise whether or not you believe those comments are consistent with the standards in the industry give the conditions observed." 
 A2.  The CAHPI Standards of Practice require that an inspector report "on those systems and components inspected which, in the professional opinion of the inspector, are significantly deficient or are near the end of their service life." 
In my opinion, the condition of the A-frame members were significantly deficient at the time of the inspection and should have been reported as such. Also in my opinion, the location of the foundations very close to the juncture between the house construction site and the steep slope, regardless of their condition, should have caused a prudent inspector to recommend that his clients consult a geotechnical engineer prior to completing their purchase decision.
In his report Mr. Toth indicates on The Big Picture/Summary page that the structure is below average, and that the MAJOR POINTS OF CONCERN: are "To fix-up structural deficiencies"
Further in the report in the Structure page, Mr. Toth notes 1) Moderate settlement and suggests that it may be ongoing 2) soil erosion a [sic] the south -- SW and 3) a check mark beside "Check with professional Engineer/pest control contractor" but does not specifically indicate the exact concern.
On the Significant Structural Deficiencies page, Mr. Toth indicates that there are "Unstable soil conditions/erosion" at the S, SW which require repair & upgrading and that "solitary foundation movements at the S side dec, SW (?)" need repair, and that "floor sag SW living rm (bsmt) settled to South" without any recommendation;
and that "wood deck unstable, lateral supports missing" and in need of repair and upgrading;
and that "wood deck's 6x6 posts have no bracing in any directions, new braces must be added. N side framing (posts and beam) moved, doesn't support the deck any more. Raise the top of the beam to support joists." Repair needed;
and that "SW deck structure, solitary foundations have major settlements, post bases have soil connections, structure has no proper connection to house. To lift-up and reinforce foundations & posts" Repairs needed;
and that "two West side timber rafters near foundations are decayed, water damaged." Repairs needed.
Mr. Toth has reported many of the structural deficiencies and recommended that his client should "check with professional engineer". In this respect, the report appears to meet the intentions of the Standards of Practice. but, in my opinion, Mr. Toth's report is deficient in as much as it does not make any recommendation to have a geotechnical review of the Property and that the report does not clearly present the significance of the problems observed.
 Q3.  Assuming that Mr. Toth verbally advised that the slope stability Issue or settlement issue related to the supports for the decks on the south side of the A-frame portion of the structure and that the cost of repair would be in the order of <damage type = "other">$15,000</damage>, was Mr. Toth's advice consistent with the standards of the industry. If not, why not? 
 A3.  The Standards of Practice are silent on the provision of repair estimates. 
Mr. Toth's contract states that "4. Cost estimates, if provided are "ball-park" estimates only and are not intended to be relied upon by any person for accuracy. The CLIENT should obtain written bids from qualified licensed contractors in order to determine the possible cost of repairs."
There are no repair costs provided in Mr. Toth's written report, therefore any cost estimates provided must have been verbal. Some inspectors provide order-of-magnitude estimates verbally to their clients, and in this respect, Mr. Toth appears to be consistent with industry practices although the provision of such estimates are beyond the requirements of the Standards of Practice.
If Mr. Toth did provide a repair estimate of <damage type = "other">$15,000</damage>, it would appear to be insufficient, based on the significance of the deteriorated condition of the structure and decks that were evident at the time of his inspection. Given the limited time that Mr. Toth spent on site and the time required to adequately inspect and report on this somewhat complex structure, there was little time available for Mr. Toth to consider and provide a "ball-park" estimate that would be a reasonable reflection of the conditions noted in the house.
28  Mr. Clayton summarized his findings regarding the beams of the House as follows:
DISCUSSION AND CASE AUTHORITIES
29  In order for negligence to be established, the Plaintiffs must establish on a balance of probabilities that the Defendants owed the Plaintiffs a duty of care, the standard of care required of a home inspector, that the Defendants breached the duty of care owed to the Plaintiffs by failing to meet the requisite standard of care, and that the breach of the duty of care caused the Plaintiffs to suffer damages.
30  In order to establish the tort of negligent misrepresentation, it is necessary to prove that there was a duty of care based on a special relationship between the parties, a representation was made by one party to the other, that representation was false, inaccurate or misleading, that misrepresentation was made negligently, the person to whom the representation was made must have reasonably relied on the representation, and the reliance must have been detrimental to that person with the consequence of the person suffering damages: Queen v. Cognos Inc., .
31  The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants breached their duty of care by failing to inspect all of the A-frame beams for rot and moisture, by failing to fully advise the Plaintiffs regarding the extent of the structural problems relating to the House, by failing to advise the Plaintiffs that a structural engineer should be retained by them, and that Mr. Toth made various statements regarding the cost of correcting the problems that he found, and that the statements amounted to negligent misrepresentation.
32  It is not disputed by the Defendants that the Defendants owed the Plaintiffs a duty to conduct the home inspection and prepare the report in a competent manner. The Defendants submit that this duty was subject to the terms of the Contract which specified that the standard against which their competence would be measured would be the Standards of Practice set out by the Canadian Association of Property and Home Inspectors.
33  CAHPI publishes a Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice ("Standards") for its members. Mr. Toth is a member of CAHPI. Mr. Toth is also a member of the British Columbia Association. The Standards of the national organization includes the following statement: "The Standards are a set of guidelines for home inspectors to following the performance of their inspections. They are the most widely-accepted home inspection guidelines in use, and include all the home's major systems and components."
34  The Standards provide in part:
2. PURPOSE AND SCOPE
2.1 The purpose of these Standards of Practice is to establish a minimum and uniform standard for private, fee-paid home inspectors who are members of one of the provincial/regional organizations of CAHPI. Home inspections performed to these Standards of Practice are intended to provide the client with information regarding the condition of the systems and components of the home as inspected at the time of the Home Inspection.
2.2 The Inspector shall:
A. Inspect:
readily accessible systems and components of homes listed in these Standards of Practice.
installed systems and components of homes listed in these Standards of Practice.
B. report:
on those systems and components inspected which, in the professional opinion of the inspector, are significantly deficient or are near the end of their service lives.
a reason why, if not self-evident, the system or component is significantly deficient or near the end of its service life.
the inspector's recommendations to correct or monitor the reported deficiency.
on any systems and components designated for inspection in these Standards of Practice which were present at the time of the Home Inspection but were not inspected and a reason they were not inspected.
3. STRUCTURAL SYSTEM
3.1 The inspector shall:
A. Inspect:
the structural components including foundation and framing.
by probing a representative number of structural components where deterioration is suspected or where clear indications of possible deterioration exist. Probing is NOT required when probing would damage any finished surface or where no deterioration is visible.
B. describe:
the foundation and report the methods used to inspect the under-floor crawl space.
the floor structure.
the wall structure.
the ceiling structure.
the roof structure and report the methods used to inspect the attic.
3.2 The inspector is NOT required to:
provide any engineering service or architectural service.
B. offer an opinion as to the adequacy of any structural system or component.
4. EXTERIOR
4.1 The inspector shall:
A. Inspect:
the exterior wall covering, flashing and trim.
all exterior doors.
attached decks, balconies, stoops, steps, porches, and their associated railings.
the eaves, soffits, and fascias where accessible from the ground level.
the vegetation, grading, surface drainage, and retaining walls on the property when any of these are likely to adversely affect the building.
walkways, patios, and driveways leading to dwelling entrances.
B. describe the exterior wall covering.
35  While paragraph 5 of the Contract states that the CAHPI "Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice" are attached to the Contract, there is nothing in evidence which would allow me to conclude that this was the case. Accordingly, I cannot conclude that it was agreed between the parties that the inspection would be performed in accordance with the CAHPI "Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice". Even if I am wrong in this regard and, in any event, I am satisfied that the Standards are only guidelines, and that a determination that the inspection had been undertaken in accordance with the Standards would not preclude a finding that the inspection was carried out negligently. In this regard, Mr. Toth at Trial stated:
Standard of Practice sets minimum expectations for the home inspectors, what they have to render during and after the inspection. I believe this is the standard, like the Bible, of every home inspector as a minimum requirement. Some inspectors try to exceed it. Some others never target to exceed it. I feel myself whatever time circumstances exist, I try to go even beyond that.
CLAIM OF THE PLAINTIFFS RELATING TO THE STRUCTURAL MEMBERS
36  The first part of the claim of the Plaintiffs relates to rotten A-beam structural members. The older A-frame portion of the House is supported by horizontal and vertical beams. The Plaintiffs submit that the ends of most of those beams were rotten at the time of the inspection by Mr. Toth, Mr. Toth did not identify all of the rotten horizontal and vertical beams, Mr. Toth did not advise them that he had not inspected all of the horizontal and vertical beams, and Mr. Toth underestimated the cost of repair of the two beams that he did identify as rotten when stating that the cost of repair would be in the neighbourhood of <damage type = "other">$4,000.00</damage>. It is now apparent that the estimated cost of replacing all of the rotten beams is in the neighbourhood of <damage type = "other">$90,000.00</damage>, and that the cost of repairing the two beams that he did identify as rotten is the neighbourhood of <damage type = "other">$35,000.00</damage>.
(a) Beams on the East Side of the House
37  I find that Mr. Toth made no inspection of the vertical beams on the east side of the House. I find that an inspection of two of those beams would have been easily accessible through an unlocked door off the lower balcony. This door led into a room that was otherwise inaccessible from inside the House. I find that even a cursory examination of the two beams in this area would have revealed to Mr. Toth that they were rotten.
38  At his October 17, 2007 Examination for Discovery, Mr. Toth could only state that he could not recall if: "... that room was or was not available for inspection." At Trial, Mr. Toth was asked whether he had tested any of the beams on the east side of the house, and stated: "Unfortunately not ... I cannot exactly recall why ... ever since, it is kind of a mystery for myself. I have no proper explanation why. I just simply don't remember." I accept the evidence that the door to the room could not be locked from the outside so that there was no impediment to Mr. Toth entering the area and discovering that there was considerable rot in two of the east side beams.
39  Under cross-examination, Mr. Toth described the area as a "crawl space" but I find that is not accurate. From the photographs in evidence, it is clear it is just a room off the exterior of the House. As to why he did not attempt to go through the door, Mr. Toth stated under cross-examination:
I make effort to open every solid door, but I cannot easily identify where they lead to, and then I supposed to open that door. I cannot recall which way I find it, closed, which way I find it even sticked to the frame or for any way it's not opening. It appeared not to opening, and that's what I expect, and that's what I -- my statement about. ...
That was a typical door of a house, and that was not marked as a crawl space door, and once I cannot or I appeared couldn't go through, I legitimately expected to be access the same room from the inside, which unfortunately never happened.
If the door is not opening, it's not readily accessible.
... because I don't remember what kind of way I used to push the door, bang the door or tried to gently open. One way or the other, the door didn't open and I didn't go in. It was not readily accessible. ...
If I would be aware that room has no interior connection and that has no other access way, then I would ask -- I would try to make effort.
40  Mr. Toth stated that it was his usual practice to go clockwise when inspecting a house and, regarding any doors that he finds, he would attempt to enter the door:
... I find the doorway which is not clear where it goes, I try to go through or clarify the door, where it goes.
So in our case, we have a solid door on that so-called crawl space, exactly the same looking and full-size door than the door beside of it, or other doors. So I assume, but I cannot hundred percent recall it, that information. I may find it locked or not opening at some point, for any reason not opening, and then I assume there will be another inside room, another room, but I will approach from the inside of the building. Which unfortunately never happened.
41  Even if Mr. Toth concluded that he could not have outside access to what was behind the door, he should have come back to that space when he determined in his later inspection of interior adjacent space that the space could not be accessed from inside the House. At Trial, Mr. Toth confirmed that he did not ask anyone to gain access to this room.
42  I find it was necessary for Mr. Toth to inspect this room and the two east side beams in order to perform his inspection appropriately. Mr. Toth is liable either in negligence or in breach of contract because he did not perform the inspection in accordance with paragraph 1 of the Contract because he did not perform a "VISUAL INSPECTION" of the "readily accessible and visible areas" of the House. At the same time, the Standards relied upon by Mr. Toth also include a requirement that such an inspection take place. If I am wrong in coming to those conclusions, I also find that Mr. Toth was negligent in not drawing to the attention of the Plaintiffs that he had not had an opportunity to inspect the two east side beams because he could not or did not access the space. Pursuant to the agreement reached between the parties, I find that the cost of repairing or replacing east side frame beams is <damage type = "other">$18,800.00</damage>.
(b) Beams on the West Side of the House
43  Regarding the horizontal and vertical beams on the west side of the House, Mr. Toth stated at his October 17, 2007 Examination for Discovery that two members were "... showing not very extensive but visible damages and wood rot", that he "... inspected with a probe all of those [all of the A-frames]", and that "The rest had no wood rot". At his Examination for Discovery, Mr. Toth repeated that he had advised the Plaintiffs that he had inspected all of the beams on the west side of the House when he was asked the following questions and gave the following answers:
 Q  And did you tell them that you'd inspected the other ones on the west side and they appeared to be fine? Did you say that to them? 
 A Yes. 
44  I find this testimony inconsistent with other testimony of Mr. Toth. At his Examination for Discovery and at Trial, Mr. Toth stated that he inspected all of the beams and found only two to have rot. At Trial, Mr. Toth stated it was only his obligation to provide the Plaintiffs with a representative number of deficiencies. In this regard, Mr. Toth stated:
Which means my duty is to give a representative number of deficiencies and explain them, and I believe I did it, even if that could be my best, despite of my best effort, I still missed one or two small location somewhere.
When I inspected it in September 2006, I find I detected wood rot on the two structure piece, and I believed that was sufficient representation of the west side A-frames.
45  At Trial, Mr. Toth stated that he only examined two of the west side beams, as that was the representative sample that was required of him. He was also asked the following question and gave the following answer:
 Q  Once you found the two beams to be rotten, didn't you think that you were going to have to go and take extra steps, unusual steps to make sure that the rest of the beams were sound? Isn't that just common sense, now that you -- you found two that are rotten, wouldn't you -- you be on sort of a high alert to make sure that the rest are -- are sound? 
 A  It was high alert enough and referring to engineering services, that will take care of the rest. 
46  According to the opinion of Mr. Clayton who was called as a witness for the Plaintiffs and who was qualified as an expert to provide an opinion regarding house inspection standards, the Standards set out by CAHPI only require a home inspector to inspect and probe: "... a representative number of structural components where deterioration is suspected, or where clear indications of possible deterioration exist". However, Mr. Clayton also provided the opinion that, despite the standards set by CAHPI, a prudent inspector would have inspected and reported on all of the A-frame members and not just some of them as required by the Standards. I agree. To fail to do so was negligent after Mr. Toth found what he did with the two beams he said he did examine.
47  Mr. Toth gave various excuses as to why it was not possible to examine all of the west side beams. Regarding the horizontal beams, Mr. Toth stated at Trial they were in "quite high". When asked whether or not he had gone up to probe the horizontal beams, Mr. Toth stated: "I just don't remember what part, but that was obvious without probing the wood ... the wood rot". He said that the wood rot on the A6 beam was visible. From the photographs taken by Mr. Clayton, it is clear that the horizontal beams on the two A-frame beams found by Mr. Toth to have rot are quite high off the ground but that the other beams are not. I reject the testimony of Mr. Toth that all of the horizontal beams were high and could not be easily inspected.
48  Mr. Toth stated at Trial that he was not in a position to inspect all of the west side horizontal and vertical beams as some of them were covered with grass so as to make them inaccessible. As to why he did not clear away the grass to make sure that he could thoroughly check the A 4 beam, Mr. Toth stated: "I am not clearing grass." "That's not part of my job." Mr. Toth appears to have forgotten that the Standards provide that an inspector is to inspect "the vegetation ... on the Property when any of these are likely to adversely affect the building".
49  A photograph taken in December 2006 regarding beam A4 indicates a "tiny clump of grass" at the bottom of the beam. At Trial, Mr. Toth was asked whether the grass was "thigh high at the time" he made the inspection, and he stated: "That's my recollection, that's correct." He also stated: "In between that was a clear-out of the whole area." However, the possibility that there had been a clearing of the vegetation in the whole area between the time when Mr. Toth conducted his inspection and December 2006 was not put to the Plaintiffs under cross-examination. Mr. Toth makes no mention of there being high grass in his written report even though the report does note in the "EXTERIOR" section, that: "Debris to remove from E side". As well, it was drawn to the attention of Mr. Toth that his report form contained a provision that he had to draw to the attention of the parties what was not inspected and the reason it was not inspected. Mr. Toth confirmed that he did not do that and did not report to the Plaintiffs that something had not been inspected.
50  Regarding the photographs taken by Mr. Clayton, Mr. Toth testified at Trial that "It's possible" that the rot had occurred between September, 2006 when he inspected that beam and December, 2006 when the photograph was taken: "It's obviously that deteriorated from September to December". At Trial, Mr. Toth stated that the rot which was evident had occurred in the two and a half years since he inspected the Property and, at the time of his inspection, the rot "wasn't there". I have no hesitation in rejecting this testimony. It is inconceivable that the rot that is shown in the photographs taken by Mr. Clayton in December 2006 could have occurred between September and December 2006. Mr. Toth was also incorrect in stating that all of Mr. Clayton's photographs were taken 2-1/2 years after his inspection of the Property. This is simply not the case.
51  I accept the evidence of Mr. Clayton. From the photographs that he took in December 2006 and from his May 13, 2009 opinion, I find that rot was well established on four of the A-frame beams and four of the horizontal beams at the time of the inspection by Mr. Toth. I conclude that the photographs which were taken by Mr. Clayton in December 2006 fairly represent the conditions that would have been found by Mr. Toth on September 21, 2006. In particular, the December 17, 2006 photograph taken by Mr. Clayton does not show any vegetation which would make it impossible for a full inspection of at least four of the horizontal and vertical beams to take place. Mr. Toth owed the plaintiffs a duty to inspect all west side beams after he ascertained that there was rot in two of the beams. I conclude that he did not do so.
52  I also find that Mr. Toth was negligent in not drawing to the attention of the Plaintiffs the extent of the rot in the beams. If he had actually examined all of the beams on the west side of the House, he could not have come to the conclusion that only two of the beams were rotten. If, on the other hand, he only examined two of the beams, he was negligent in not drawing to the attention of the Plaintiffs that he had only examined two of the beams and had not examined the others. I find that the examination of only two of the beams was not in accordance with the obligations that Mr. Toth owed to the Plaintiffs. Mr. Toth was also negligent when he described the "MAJOR POINTS OF CONCERN" for the "STRUCTURE" as being to "fix-up structural deficiencies". This is hardly a sufficient description of what needed to be done to correct the "deficiencies". I find that the use of the word "fix-up" lulled the Plaintiffs into assuming that minor or cosmetic changes could be made in order to meet the "MAJOR POINTS OF CONCERN".
53  I also find Mr. Toth negligent in his failure to advise the Plaintiffs that they should have structural engineers examine the beams. Mr. Toth was asked whether he told the Plaintiffs that they needed engineers to go and probe the rest of the beams and he answered: "no". I accept the opinion of Mr. Clayton that: "A prudent inspector would have recommended that a (structural) engineering, experienced in heavy timber construction, be engaged to review the condition and make further recommendations with respect to repair and costs of repairs." The failure of Mr. Toth to provide this advice to the Plaintiffs amounts to negligence.
54  Regarding the costs of repairing the two rotten west side beams, I accept the evidence of the Plaintiffs that they were provided with a repair estimate in the neighbourhood of <damage type = "other">$4,000.00</damage> by Mr. Toth. By agreement between the parties, the actual cost of replacing the west side beams is <damage type = "other">$35,000.00</damage>.
55  Despite paragraph 4 of the Contract which provides that, if cost estimates are provided, they are "ballpark" estimates only, Mr. Toth was adamant that he would generally never provide such estimates. At Trial, Mr. Toth stated that he gave them a "ballpark rough estimate" but that "I asked him to obtain quotes from contractor, and he should expect somewhere around this ballpark figure for that particular carpentry job." [to repair the two A-frame members]. Mr. Toth stated that he was not expected to give any ballpark figures but, because Mr. Salgado insisted, he did give them a ballpark estimate: "My best honest guess." When asked whether it was normal and a standard practice to provide estimates to clients, Mr. Toth stated: "No", as it was "not the home inspector's job to do. We don't have a enough information for current market conditions."
56  Paragraph 4 of his standard form of contract contemplated that "ballpark" estimates might be provided. Accordingly, I cannot accept his evidence that it was not his normal and standard practice to provide such estimates to clients who requested his advice. I find that the repair estimate of <damage type = "other">$4,000</damage> relating to the west side beams was provided to the Plaintiffs by Mr. Toth. I find that this estimate of <damage type = "other">$4,000</damage> was woefully inaccurate. While I cannot conclude that the Plaintiffs relied upon this estimate provided by Mr. Toth, I do find that the estimate of <damage type = "other">$4,000.00</damage> lulled the Plaintiffs into assuming that the rot was of no particular importance, and that it could be inexpensively corrected.
57  I find that Mr. Toth was negligent in his inspection of the horizontal and vertical beams on both sides of the House. Mr. Toth was negligent in not inspecting the east side beams, and was negligent in his inspection of the west side beams by either inspecting only two and not advising the Plaintiffs that he had only done so or by not drawing to their attention that the rot was much more widespread than he indicated to them. His breaches of duty of care caused the Plaintiffs to suffer damages. But for the negligent act and/or the omission, the damages would not have occurred as the purchase of the Property would not have occurred. I find that the Plaintiffs would not have purchased the Property if the full extent of the rot on the east and west side beams of the House had been known and brought to their attention. In the circumstances, the Plaintiffs are entitled to damages of $35,000.00 plus $18,800.00 less the $4,000.00 estimate provided by Mr. Toth.
CLAIM OF THE PLAINTIFFS RELATING TO THE STABILITY OF THE HOUSE
58  The second part of the claim of the Plaintiffs relates to the stability of the House. The south portion of the House sits on fill that was not properly compacted at the time of construction, the House is being undermined, this settlement results in stress on the structural members of the House, and, in order to stabilize the structure, the geotechnical and structural engineers who have been retained by the Plaintiffs have recommended that extensive remedial work be undertaken. The Plaintiffs submit that Mr. Toth failed to properly warn them of the extent of the problem and that he stated to them that the problem could be dealt with by way of remedial work costing less than <damage type = "other">$16,000.00</damage>, whereas the estimated cost is now in excess of <damage type = "other">$75,000.00</damage>.
59  In his written report, Mr. Toth indicated that the "settlement" was "Moderate" and that it might be "Ongoing" as he had a question mark beside that word on the printed form for the component "STRUCTURE". He also indicated that the rating for "STRUCTURE" was half way between "average" and "below".
60  At his October 17, 2007 Examination for Discovery, Mr. Toth was asked the following questions and gave the following answers:
So just so I can summarize your evidence on this point, the evidence that you saw of either settlement in the past or ongoing settlement was by looking at the cement abutments at the base of the A-frame beams on the west side --
Yes.
-- and by looking at the foundations supporting the deck, that is where the post met the cement footings, correct?
Yes.
And then I think you mentioned earlier in your testimony in the ceiling of the deck or towards -- I think it's over towards where the hot tub is, some of the joists appeared to be -- have pulled away from the roof above?
Yes.
So those were the three aspects of the residence that indicated to you that there was settlement or perhaps ongoing settlement; is that correct?
It's not containing the fourth one which we marked here, the basement floor and associated strip foundation which were noticed and reported to being settled. So that's four different kind of settlements.
Well, or at least symptoms of settlement?
Symptoms, that's correct.
So just so I understand the fourth one, I understand your point about that the floor of the basement in the A-frame has a slope to it which you observed, correct, without measuring the slope?
The A-frame and the basement floor has no connection.
61  At his October 17, 2007 Examination for Discovery, Mr. Toth stated that he did not give: "... any figures as to the possible costs of remedying the perceived problem or potential problem with the settlement aspect of the matter". I find that testimony to be inconsistent with what Mr. Toth stated at Trial when he testified:
So I said I don't know. I don't know how much. And it's not simple to answer this question at all. I could tell them the carpentry work to fix up the deck and fix up the rafter, reported rafter, it would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of [<damage type = "other">$15,000.00</damage> to] <damage type = "other">$20,000.00</damage>, but they should obtain a general contractor or specific contractor to obtain. This is just should be treated as a very ballpark guess. ...
I mentioned to plaintiff the engineer, based on his information, may well specify retaining walls, piling, or any other engineering solution for the problem. And I have no idea how much that would cost, that what kind of work that would be. I mentioned this -- this possibilities, and I gave absolutely no financial -- not even ballpark figure. This mention of [<damage type = "other">$4,000.00</damage> to] <damage type = "other">$5,000.00</damage>, I never heard about that.
62  At the Trial, Mr. Toth stated that he told the Plaintiffs that the "unstable soil conditions/erosions" "... along the whole south line from the east corner to the west corner, and specifically the southwest area turning to the west side, soil erosion and was noted. Soil erosion was noted on all foundation areas." Regarding the check mark beside the statement "settlement moderate", Mr. Toth at Trial stated that he reviewed that with the Plaintiffs and, after he presented what was written in the report, he stated:
... these are those visual clues of structural movements deterioration. I cannot tell in a short visual inspection with my -- my limitation whether this movements are still ongoing or they not ongoing. ...
I did not see any inside or outside major visual clues to tell the sequence how this movement -- this movements developed.
There are no reportable clues. The only thing we can do and they can do a further geotechnical engineering evaluation, because even an engineer cannot tell on a short visual observation if that's ongoing or not ongoing. And I not only told my client, only engineering and geotechnical firm can give the answer, but I also recommended, during that discussion, I would recommend a geotechnical firm who is familiar with North Vancouver geographic area.
63  During his cross-examination at Trial, Mr. Toth was asked whether the Plaintiffs could deduce from the question mark beside whether "settlement" was "Ongoing", that this was a "very, very important piece of advice", and that "this house may settle down this slope". Mr. Toth stated that it was sufficient combined with "the verbal explanation". In response to whether the written part of his report was to contain all of the salient information, Mr. Toth stated that this is why he had checked the need for an engineer and verbally explained: "the geotechnical survey, geotechnical report or examination needed".
64  However, Mr. Toth also made this statement at Trial regarding the checkmark beside "check with professional engineer":
I don't remember if I pointed out the check mark itself. The discussion was not pointing on the check mark. Discussion was pointing what to do. And what to do is included the recommendation what I said. ...
My intent was to check with professional engineer for complete information. I admit I probably was better to cross the pest control word at that time.
65  I accept the opinion of Mr. Clayton that there should have been a recommendation that the Plaintiffs consult a geotechnical engineer prior to deciding whether they would remove the subject clause in the Agreement. In dealing with "STRUCTURE", Mr. Toth indicates that the rating was between "average" and "below", but he does not set out whether the repairs that are recommended by him are either "Major" or "Minor". He only describes the "settlement" as being "Moderate", and he questions whether it is "ongoing". While there is a checkmark beside the printed words "CHECK WITH PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING/PEST CONTROL CONTRACTOR OR _____ FOR COMPLETE INFORMATION", the specific concern regarding why a professional engineer should be consulted is not set out. As well, it is not clear whether this is only an indication that a "pest control contractor" should be consulted.
66  While Mr. Clayton was of the opinion that the part of the report of Mr. Toth dealing with "STRUCTURE" met the Standards set out by the CAHPI, I also accept the opinion of Mr. Clayton and I find that Mr. Toth was negligent in not recommending a geotechnical review of the Property and by not clearly presenting the significance of the problems observed. I find that Mr. Toth owed the Plaintiffs a duty of care, and that this duty was not met because he did not recommend to the Plaintiffs that they should consult a geotechnical engineer prior to deciding whether to proceed with the purchase of the Property. I have no hesitation in concluding that the Plaintiffs relied upon the advice received from Mr. Toth before deciding whether they would remove the subject clauses contained within the Contract and proceed to purchase the Property. As a result of the reliance of the Plaintiffs on the advice received from Mr. Toth regarding the stability of the House, the Plaintiffs proceeded to purchase the Property and have suffered damages as a result of that purchase. But for the negligence of Mr. Toth, the damages suffered by the Plaintiffs would not have been incurred.
67  I accept the evidence presented on behalf of the Plaintiffs that Mr. Toth gave them a repair estimate of <damage type = "other">$15,000.00</damage> for structural work relating to the stability of the House. That estimate was woefully inadequate. While I find that damages are not available to the Plaintiffs as a result of this negligent misrepresentation of the likely cost of the structural changes that were required in order to provide stability for the House because I cannot come to the conclusion that the Plaintiffs relied on this misrepresentation to their detriment, I find that the estimate that was provided gave considerable solace to the Plaintiffs that the structural expenditures would not be excessive and, therefore, the structural problems were not significant. I find that the Plaintiffs are entitled to the actual cost of the structural changes which are required, including engineering costs, being $56,800.00, $26,269.00, $9,360.00, $24,100.00 and $11,500.00, less the $15,000.00 estimate provided by Mr. Toth.
68  I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the Plaintiffs relied upon the report received by Mr. Toth to decide whether they would purchase the Property. At his December 16, 2008 Examination for Discovery, Mr. Salgado was asked what expectations he had regarding the inspection that would be performed by Mr. Toth, and he stated: "Well, that he would determine if the subject would be removed." Mr. Salgado was also asked the following questions, and gave the following answers:
So you were looking to him for advice as to whether you should buy or not buy; is that fair to say?
I would think so, yes. ... And then I basically asked him if the house -- if I should go through with the deal; you know, if there was anything that he had noticed that would impede me from buying the house.
Yes. And what did he say?
He said no. ... Then I ask again, and then he said you can go ahead, there's no problem.
Okay. So a moment ago you told me that he simply said no, now you're saying that he said you can go ahead, there's no problem.
A moment ago I told you that I asked him about three times.
69  I find it significant that Mr. Toth was not in a position to deny that the Plaintiffs had asked him whether or not they should proceed to purchase the House. At Trial, Mr. Toth was asked the following question and gave the following answer:
Mr. Toth, did the plaintiffs ask you a question, something to the effect of whether or not they should purchase the house?
I cannot recall.
70  The purpose of obtaining an inspection is to provide a lay purchaser with expert advice about any substantial deficiencies or, as is set out in the Standards, any "significantly deficient" problem relating to systems or components that can be discerned upon a visual inspection - deficiencies of the type or magnitude that reasonably can be expected to have some bearing upon the decision-making process of a purchaser regarding whether they will purchase the property or upon which they will renegotiate the price. An inspector invites reliance by the very nature of the advice that is given. Plainly, if prospective home purchasers did not believe that they could secure meaningful and reliable advice about the home they were considering purchasing, there would be no reason for them to retain an inspector to inspect that home. In the case, reliance is obvious.
EFFECT OF THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY CLAUSE
71  The Defendants submit that any liability found on the part of the Defendants will be limited by the limitation of liability clauses set out in paragraphs 1, 4, 13 and 16(b) of the Contract. I cannot reach that conclusion.
72  Paragraph 1 of the Contract provides that: "The inspection and report are not intended to reflect on the market value of the Property nor to make any recommendation as to the advisability of purchase." I am satisfied that this part of paragraph 1 does not exclude any liability on behalf of the Defendants. There are no words which attempt to limit liability and, in any event, while it may not have been intended that there be any recommendation regarding the advisability of purchase, the Plaintiffs were entitled to rely on any recommendations as to the advisability of purchase if such recommendations were made. I find that such recommendations were made and relied upon.
73  I find that the Plaintiffs did not read the terms of the Contract prior to Mr. Salgado signing it. I accept the evidence of the Plaintiffs that they felt rushed because of the schedule of Mr. Toth. However, I also find the Plaintiffs were intelligent, university-educated people and that they had entered into contracts previously and knew that placing their signature upon a contract had legal implications. The Defendants submit that, in the absence of fraud or misrepresentations, a person is bound by an agreement signed by them whether or not the person has read its contents and that the failure to read a contract before signing it is not a legally acceptable reason for refusing to be bound by its terms: Fraser Jewellers (1982) Ltd. v. Dominion Electric Protection Co.,  (Ont. C.A.) at paras. 30-31).
74  The Defendants also submit that it was not necessary for them to draw to the attention of the Plaintiffs any onerous terms or to ensure that the Plaintiffs had read and understood those terms and that the only exception is where the circumstances are such that they would realize that the Plaintiffs were not consenting to those terms. In Karoll v. Silver Star Mountain Resorts Ltd.  (B.C.S.C.), McLachlin C.J.S.C., as she then was, stated:
Many factors may be relevant to whether the duty to take reasonable steps to advise of an exclusion clause or waiver arises. The effect of the exclusion clause in relation to the nature of the contract is important because if it runs contrary to the party's normal expectations it is fair to assume that he does not intend to be bound by the term. The length and format of the contract and the time available for reading and understanding it also bear on whether a reasonable person should know that the other party did not in fact intend to sign what he was signing. This list is not exhaustive. Other considerations may be important, depending on the facts of the particular case.
(at p. 166)
75  Here, the Plaintiffs were given little time to read the Contract and understand what the Defendants intended to be the effect of the Contract. As well, the primary purpose of the meeting between Mr. Toth and the Plaintiffs was to advise them regarding the results of this inspection. I find that very little time was available for the Plaintiffs to read and understand what was in the Contract. By the very nature of the relationship, the ability to rely on what was being said was critical and, if there was any suggestion that the Plaintiffs could not rely upon what was being said by Mr. Toth and what was set out in his report, I find that Mr. Salgado would not have signed the Contract. In the circumstances, it was incumbent upon Mr. Toth to draw to the attention of Mr. Salgado the exclusion and waiver clauses and to take reasonable steps to apprise Mr. Salgado of the onerous terms and to ensure that he read and understood them.
76  As well, exclusion clauses must be drafted with complete clarity and the principle of contra proferentum should be applied. In Bauer v. Bank of Montreal  (S.C.C.), McIntyre J., on behalf of the Court, stated:
In construing such a clause, the Court shall see that the clause is expressed clearly and that it is limited in its effect to the narrow meaning of the words employed and it must clearly cover the exact circumstances which have arisen in order to afford protection to the party claiming benefit. It is generally to be construed against the party benefiting from the exemption and this is particularly true where the clause is found in a standard printed form of contract, frequently termed a contract of adhesion, which is presented by one party to the other as the basis of their transaction. (at p. 428)
77  In reviewing the "Property Inspection Contract", it must be noted that the Contract is separate from the 17-page Report which starts with the heading "The Big Picture/Summary". There is nothing in the Contract which incorporates the subsequent reporting pages into the Contract. Regarding paragraph 16(b) of the Contract, there are no "representations or warranties" in the Contract. While it may have been the intent of paragraph 16(b) to exclude representations or warranties that arose outside the Contract, it could not have been in the contemplation of the parties that a reference to a document containing no representations or warranties would exclude representations or warranties that were made to induce the Plaintiffs to enter into the Contract or which were contained in the oral or written report subsequently provided by Mr. Toth.
78  Under the Contract, the "Inspector" is defined as being "659279 B.C. Ltd. dba HomePro Inspections". Accordingly, I am satisfied that the attempt to limit liability by paragraph 13 of the Contract relates only to the "Inspector" and not to Mr. Toth personally. It was Mr. Toth who was the inspector. It is Mr. Toth who is the member of the CAHPI (B.C.). In this regard, the cover page indicates "This report prepared by: Imre Toth, B.Arch., RHI, Member of the Canadian Association of Home and Property Inspectors (B.C.)." I am satisfied that the ambiguity regarding whether the provisions of paragraph 13 of the Contract were also to apply to any failure by Mr. Toth to perform any obligations should be resolved against Mr. Toth in favour of a reasonable and fair interpretation.
79  Regarding paragraph 9 of the Contract, it is important to note that it purports to exclude any "GUARANTEE OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED" RELATING TO: ... THE FUTURE ADEQUACY, PERFORMANCE OR CONDITION OF ANY INSPECTED STRUCTURE, ITEM OR SYSTEM." (bold type and capitalization in the original). I find that paragraph 9 is not broad enough to exclude a "guarantee or warranty, express or implied" regarding the present adequacy, performance or condition of any inspected structure, item or system. That is the very nature of the inspection that was undertaken. Again, I am satisfied that the doctrine of contra proferentum applies and that any "guarantee or warranty, express or implied" relate to the adequacy, performance or condition of any inspected structure, item or system at the time of the inspection would not be excluded by paragraph 9. While I make no findings that Mr. Toth guaranteed or warranted anything to the Plaintiffs, I make this finding regarding this paragraph of the Contract in the context of the consistent failure to exclude liability.
80  I find that the Defendants are not in a position to rely on paragraphs 1, 9, 13 and 16 of the Contract to exclude liability for the damages which I find were suffered by the Plaintiffs as a result of the oral and written report provided by Mr. Toth.
SHOULD THERE BE APPORTIONMENT?
81  The Defendants submit that, if the Court finds liability on the part of the Defendants, this liability should be apportioned between them and the former Defendants, Mr. and Ms. Shannon. In the Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Shannons made negligent representations, including that "the residence was a solid house" and "the settlement observed by the Plaintiffs had been there forever, and was not ongoing". It is submitted by the Defendants that, if the Plaintiffs reasonably relied upon any representations, it must be that they relied upon those of Mr. and Ms. Shannon, and liability should be apportioned. The Defendants submit that, as there is no apparent means to determine the apportionment, a 50-50 apportionment between the Defendants and Mr. and Ms. Shannon is mandated by the Negligence Act.
82  There is nothing before me which would allow me to conclude that the Plaintiffs relied upon any representations made by Mr. and Ms. Shannon prior to the Plaintiffs entering into the September 15, 2006 Agreement. Rather, I am satisfied that the Plaintiffs relied only on the statements made by Mr. Toth in his oral and written report. The Plaintiffs relied on what was provided by Mr. Toth and arranged for his inspection in order to have a neutral party provide them with an assessment of the Property and the House. I reject the argument that there should be an apportionment between the Defendants and Mr. and Ms. Shannon of the damages that I find payable by the Defendants.
CONCLUSION
83  The Plaintiffs will be entitled to Judgment against the Defendants in the amount of <damage type = "total">$192,920.45</damage>. As the parties advise that the provisions of Rule 37(b) of the Rules of Court apply, the parties will be at liberty to speak to the question of costs in due course.

Action by Gray against the defendant Fraser Health Authority for damages for negligence. In January 2005 Gray suffered injuries from an improperly administered intramuscular injection of gravol and Demerol into her left upper arm at a hospital operated by the Authority. The Authority conceded that the injection was given negligently. At the time Gray received the injection she was an industrious and active 39-year old woman who led a full and enjoyable life. She was employed as a community home care nurse in a permanent part-time position and she worked 70 per cent of a full-time position. The injection was given to Gray as an analgesic to make her trip home more comfortable after she was being discharged upon the successful completion of surgery. The nurse who administered the injection did not use any of the usual mapping techniques to properly locate the site before she gave the injection. Immediately, Gray's left forearm and hand became numb and her wrist went limp. She could not move her fingers. By the following day her symptoms did not abate. A neurologist who examined her concluded that her left radial nerve was damaged and he diagnosed her with left radial nerve palsy caused by the injection. The neurologist formed the view that the injection had been given below the safe injection site of Gray's upper left arm. He had no course of treatment to recommend and did not hold out much hope for recovery. There were now many things that Gray could not do in her household. She and her husband separated as he could not handle her inability to perform many of the chores he was accustomed to her doing. The new division of labour and their tighter financial circumstances ended the already strained marriage. Gray gradually experienced improvement in her arm and by April 2006 her neurologist found she demonstrated normal power and sensation in that arm. In June 2006 she returned to work after an absence of 17 months. There were, however, limitations on her ability to use her left arm and she continued to suffer pain and discomfort. 

HELD: Action allowed.
 Gray suffered intermittent symptoms of pain, global achiness and heaviness in her upper left limb since her return to work. These were triggered by the overuse of her arm when she took on extra work shifts. If Gray had not received the injection she would not have experienced the overuse symptoms. Because her residual weakness was permanent Gray's chronic condition would not likely change or improve by any remarkable measure. Gray experienced a miraculous recovery but it was not a full recovery for she was left with weakness in her left arm. She did not fail to mitigate her damages. Her non-pecuniary damages were assessed at <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$80,000</damage>. Her past income loss was assessed at <damage type = "past wage loss">$60,000</damage>. Until her retirement Gray would be able to work more than 70 per cent of full-time but less than 100 per cent without triggering her overuse symptoms. The evidence indicated that Gray suffered an impairment of future earning capacity and that it would likely harm her future earning ability. Gray was awarded <damage type = "sub-future wage loss">$160,000</damage> for the loss of her future earning capacity and an additional <damage type = "sub-future wage loss">$9,000</damage> for compensation for the negative effects on her pension. An award of <damage type = "future care">$8,000</damage> was made for future care costs for physiotherapy and massage therapy to deal with her overuse symptoms. No award was made for her claim for assistance with housework and home maintenance activities,

Reasons for Judgment
S.K. BALLANCE J.
I. INTRODUCTION
1  This trial concerns the effects upon the plaintiff, Laurie Gray, of an improperly administered intramuscular injection of gravol and demerol into her left upper arm (the "Injection"), and the damages to which she is entitled.
2  The defendant concedes that the Injection was given negligently on January 24, 2005, by a nurse at the Ridge Meadows Hospital (the "Hospital").
II. BACKGROUND 
(a) Ms. Gray
3  At the time that Ms. Gray received the misplaced Injection, she was an industrious and active 39 year old woman leading a full and enjoyable life. She resided with her husband and two children on their 2.5 acre hobby farm in Coombs on Vancouver Island. Ms. Gray had obtained her bachelor's degree in nursing as a mature student after her children were both in school. At the time of the incident, she was employed as a community home care nurse by the Vancouver Island Health Authority ("VIHA") in a permanent part-time position, working the equivalent of 70% of a full-time position. She had worked in that 0.7 position since 2002.
4  As a community home care nurse, Ms. Gray is responsible for patient care in a fixed geographic area on Vancouver Island. Her work consists of a considerable amount of palliative care, chronic disease maintenance and wound care, involving the use of tweezers, cutting and suturing. She drives herself to each patient's home to provide the requisite nursing care. Ms. Gray carries a tote bag containing her patients' charts and a separate bag with her medical supplies. They are not very heavy. Some part of her day, up to two hours, routinely centres on planning and office work.
5  Prior to the Injection, Ms. Gray pursued many leisure and domestic interests and carried out numerous daily chores. The heat source for the family log home was wood. Practically daily, Ms. Gray and members of her family chopped and stacked wood to fuel the stove. She was also primarily responsible for the majority of the other outside chores, including raising wild birds for food and tending to the family's many pets. Gardening and cooking are particular passions. She cultivated an expansive garden area with fruit trees and maintained a large greenhouse where she grew vegetables and flowers. She gathered, dried, and preserved fruit. She also regularly hosted large gatherings of family and friends in her home, preparing and serving elaborate meals for her guests.
6  During the winter months, Ms. Gray focused her energies on indoor pursuits, especially crafts, such as weaving baskets and crocheting. She made leather moccasins and adorned them with beads.
7  For his part, Ms. Gray's husband concentrated mostly on maintaining their boat and fleet of other recreational vehicles.
8  Ms. Gray kept physically fit through a variety of recreational activities. She enjoyed water skiing, boating, riding dirt bikes and quad-bikes through bushy forests and uneven terrain, jet skiing, kayaking, extreme camping and hiking and tennis. She had been a competitive swimmer as a youngster; and as an adult would periodically swim fifty laps or so for enjoyment and exercise. Ms. Gray is predominantly right-handed but performs certain activities with her left hand, such as tennis and playing pool.
(b) The Injection and its Aftermath
9  Ms. Gray grew up in the Maple Ridge area of the lower mainland. Several members of her family continue to reside there. For many years, she has routinely travelled to Maple Ridge to visit her widowed mother. While on a planned trip to see her mother in January 2005, Ms. Gray required an urgent abdominal hysterectomy. That procedure was performed at the Hospital successfully and without complications.
10  On January 24, 2005, in anticipation of her discharge from the Hospital, Ms. Gray's self-administering morphine pump was discontinued. A nurse offered to inject her with an analgesic to make the trip home more comfortable. Ms. Gray assumed that the nurse would inject the needle into the large muscle area of her buttock, so she began to lower her slacks. However, with virtually no warning, the nurse administered the Injection in the triceps region of Ms. Gray's upper left arm. The nurse did not use any of the usual mapping techniques to properly locate the site prior to giving the Injection.
11  The ill-effects were immediate. Ms. Gray experienced electrical, jolt-like sensations down her left arm to the tips of her fingers. Her left forearm and hand became entirely numb, and her wrist went limp. She could not move her fingers.
12  Later that day, Ms. Gray's sister-in-law telephoned the Hospital and spoke to the nurse who had given the Injection. The nurse assured her that she would call a pharmacist and telephone back, but she did not do so. Ms. Gray took it upon herself to contact a pharmacist at a local drug store, who advised that she ought to wait twenty-four hours before seeking medical attention to see whether her symptoms would resolve. Although Ms. Gray was concerned, she was also hopeful that her adverse reaction to the Injection was merely temporary. She had never before experienced any physical or medical difficulties with her left arm, wrist, or hand.
13  Ms. Gray says that she knew she was in trouble the following day because her symptoms had not abated. She was devastated and shocked. She feared that her lack of sensation and paralysis could be long term. Ms. Gray consulted her mother's doctor, who made an immediate referral to Dr. Tessler, a neurologist.
14  Dr. Tessler first examined Ms. Gray on January 28, 2005. His motor examination showed that her left triceps muscle was intact, but that her brachioradialis muscle, which pulls the arm up, and the extensor muscles of her left fingers were weak. She had a wrist drop with no ability to lift her left hand. Sensory examination revealed numbness over the dorsal (back) side of her left forearm and on the first web space between her thumb and index finger on the back of her left hand.
15  Dr. Tessler concluded that Ms. Gray's sensory and motor abnormalities indicated that her left radial nerve had been injured. He diagnosed left radial nerve palsy caused by the Injection. Dr. Tessler formed the view that the Injection had been given well below the safe injection site of Ms. Gray's left upper arm. He explained that the motor component of the radial nerve extends to the back of the wrist to extend and straighten the fingers and the wrist. In order for the mechanical grip to be strong, it must be accompanied by the wrist remaining in a straight or extended position. The weakness of Ms. Gray's muscles that extend her left wrist resulted in her wrist drop. With her hand in that position, Ms. Gray had very limited movement or control of her fingers.
16  Explaining the situation to Ms. Gray in layperson's terms, Dr. Tessler stated that the needle used in the Injection had either severed or blown-up her left radial nerve. He had no course of treatment to recommend, other than to suggest that she splint her wrist and rest her arm. He told her that he did not hold out much hope for recovery. His plan was to wait to see whether her radial nerve might repair on its own.
17  When Ms. Gray returned home to Vancouver Island, she consulted Dr. Maccari. He has been her family physician for approximately fifteen years. During his initial examination, he observed that Ms. Gray's left wrist drop prevented her from lifting her hand or fingers. Dr. Maccari also noted that she had virtually no active extension of her left wrist and fingers. The reduction in sensation of her left arm was significant; it approached total anaesthesia in the left hand in the sensory distribution of the left radial nerve. He concurred with Dr. Tessler's diagnosis of a left radial nerve injury. Dr. Maccari had no specific treatment recommendation other than to endorse Dr. Tessler's advice that Ms. Gray use splints to immobilize and rest her arm.
18  In fairly short order, Ms. Gray attended a physiotherapist who was unable to offer treatment unless she recovered some motor functioning. She also saw an occupational therapist who made customized splints for her left hand and left wrist. The splints were intended to serve several purposes. One splint lifted Ms. Gray's wrist in order to place her hand in a functional position to allow some movement of her fingers; another splint placed her wrist and hand in an anatomically correct position for resting. Collectively, the splints also prevented a further stretching or deformity of the radial nerve. Ms. Gray consulted a plastic reconstructive and hand surgeon who advised her that surgical treatment was not an option. She tried acupuncture and was given massages to her left arm and hand from friends and family.
19  Ms. Gray's immobilized left arm triggered an unwelcome and dramatic transformation at the Gray family home. According to Ms. Gray, "everything changed" because there were so many things that she could no longer do. She struggled with the most basic everyday activities, like dressing, personal care, and grooming. She could not even braid her hair or put in her contact lenses. Although the splints provided some degree of assistance, they were by no means able to restore full functioning of her left forearm, wrist, hand, or fingers.
20  Of necessity, Ms. Gray developed ways to perform certain tasks using only her right arm. She resorted to making much simpler meals which she could prepare by using mainly her right arm and hand. She needed and received daily personal assistance from her family, especially from her daughter. Friends also pitched in on occasion. They helped mow the lawn, clean her home, and cut, carry and stockpile the wood for the main stove.
21  Ms. Gray drives a vehicle with a stick-shift. She testified that after the Injection, she was not able to drive until she became comfortable with her splints. That took at least four months. Even then, she would typically use her knee to hold the steering wheel in place while she shifted gears with her right hand.
22  There is no dispute that by March 7, 2005, Ms. Gray was fully recovered from her hysterectomy but that her left radial nerve injury stemming from the misplaced Injection prevented her from returning to work at that time. Coincidentally, by that date, she had depleted all of her available sick leave. She, therefore, had to rely on employment insurance benefits until her entitlement to long term disability crystalized. As between she and her husband, Ms. Gray had been the larger income earner. Her reduced income caused the family a degree of financial hardship.
23  Ms. Gray's daughter, Sierra Gray, was an impressive witness. She presented her evidence in an articulate and thoughtful manner. I found her to be credible and reliable. I accept her testimony without reservation.
24  Sierra Gray spoke about her mother's significant contribution to running the family household and maintaining the Coombs property prior to the Injection, and the severe curtailment of her contribution afterwards. She likewise supported her mother's evidence concerning the profoundly negative impact the left arm injury had on Ms. Gray's recreational and domestic pursuits and her day-to-day living. Sierra Gray also credibly recalled that her mother was adversely affected emotionally. She testified that although her mother tried to suppress how she felt, it was clear that her spirits had become very low in trying to cope with her injury and the life changes flowing from it.
25  Sierra Gray not only assumed more of the domestic chores previously done by her mother, she also assisted her mother with daily personal care tasks of the most basic kind. She would often massage her mother's hand in the hope of improving circulation; later, as sensation returned, she performed massage in an attempt to offer temporary pain relief.
26  Around April 2005, Sierra Gray became pregnant. She moved from the family home to rental accommodation with her boyfriend. She made a conscious decision to live only five minutes away from the family home in order to be in close proximity to her mother and readily available to continue to assist her. She visited her mother every day during this time.
27  When Ms. Gray saw Dr. Maccari on May 13, 2005, she complained about the onset of a new ache and pain in her left wrist. He suspected tendonitis, the inflammation of one or more tendons which are the connective tissue that link muscle to bone. Dr. Maccari sent Ms. Gray for an X-ray of her left wrist to rule out an injury to the bone. The X-ray showed no acute boney injury, which, in Dr. Maccari's opinion, confirmed his diagnosis of tendonitis in her left wrist.
28  At a subsequent appointment on June 16, 2005, Dr. Maccari recorded apparent muscle atrophy (wasting) of Ms. Gray's left forearm. Around that time, he also completed the physician portion of a form submitted in support of Ms. Gray's application for CPP benefits on which he reported two diagnoses:
iatrogenic left radial nerve palsy; and
tendonitis left extensor wrist/distal forearm.
On the form, Dr. Maccari also reported that Ms. Gray was unable to perform any activity involving the use of her left hand. He further wrote that her prognosis was very guarded and that it was very unlikely that she would recover extension hand and wrist motion to any significant degree.
29  Ms. Gray's condition remained unchanged for a period of approximately five months after the Injection. After that time, she began to experience fleeting sensations of sharp pain in her left forearm. Despite the discomfort, Ms. Gray was excited by the prospect that the sensation in her arm was returning. At this stage, she still had no functioning of her left wrist or hand.
30  Dr. Tessler sent Ms. Gray for nerve conduction testing and an electro-myographic study on August 17, 2005. Some evidence of reinnervation of the tested muscles was detected, giving Ms. Gray increased hope for recovery.
31  On September 15, 2005, Ms. Gray reported to Dr. Maccari a mild improvement in her active left finger and wrist extension, as well as the pincer strength of her left hand. Dr. Maccari observed these positive changes on his examination.
32  During the ensuing months between September 2005 and April 2006, Ms. Gray's left arm sensory and motor deficits gradually improved. In his records for February 10, 2006, Dr. Maccari noted an objective finding of slightly decreased left grip strength. He reported that finding, among others, on a form submitted to Ms. Gray's disability insurer. Ms. Gray also described to him an internal cramping pain along her left arm as her left radial nerve regenerated. Over time, she began to detect increased mobility in her fingers and noticed that her reliance on her splints was decreasing.
33  As her motor functioning slowly returned, Ms. Gray became increasingly able to attend to her personal care. Even so, her recreational and leisure activities continued to be extremely limited as compared to before the Injection. She could not engage in intense activities or gardening and was not able to hold anything of significant weight. She avoided participation in most of the sports and recreational pursuits that she had formerly enjoyed for fear that she would fall on her left arm and cause additional damage. She tried kayaking once but found that she lacked the necessary strength in her left arm to paddle through an eddy. She felt it would be unsafe to try again because she was concerned that she would not be able to correct herself if the kayak tipped over. On one occasion, Ms. Gray tripped over her suitcase and noticed that her left arm reaction was too slow to protect her fall.
34  When Dr. Tessler saw Ms. Gray on April 4, 2006, he found that she was demonstrating normal power and sensation of her left arm. He told her that she could return to work. At that time, he did not anticipate any late or delayed complications to arise in the future.
35  According to Ms. Gray, she was still experiencing occasional clumsiness of her left hand with fine motor activity. She also says that although her left grip had returned, it often felt weak. Dr. Maccari concluded that as of Ms. Gray's visit on April 28, 2006, her left forearm and hand demonstrated virtually normal strength and sensation. He testified that despite the recovery of her left radial nerve, because Ms. Gray was still exhibiting some mild functional impairment, he was against her returning to her work duties in April 2006. Accordingly, Dr. Maccari recommended that Ms. Gray convalesce a short time longer before returning to work. She followed his advice. It was reasonable for her to do so.
36  In early to mid-June 2006, Ms. Gray participated in a short return to work program. She returned to her permanent part-time position effective June 21, 2006. By then, she had been absent from work for about seventeen months; all but the initial six weeks of that missed time was due solely to the disabling and generally adverse effects of the Injection.
37  During Ms. Gray's absence from work, a number of changes took place in her personal life. In October 2005, she welcomed the arrival of her first grandchild. Approximately one month later, she separated from her husband. Ms. Gray does not blame the aftermath of the Injection for her separation per se. However, there is a connection in the sense that her husband was not able to cope with the reality that his formerly vigorous wife was unable to perform the many chores that he was accustomed to, such as the preparation of elaborate meals, gardening, preserving food, tending the pets and wild birds, cutting and stacking firewood, cleaning the house and chauffeuring the children. The new division of labour in the family and their tighter financial circumstances brought an end to Ms. Gray's already strained marriage.
38  Mr. and Ms. Gray's principal asset of value was the Coombs acreage, which was heavily mortgaged. It was ultimately sold in April 2006, leaving negligible equity. In May 2006, Ms. Gray moved into her current rental home in Nanoose. It is a modest two bedroom cottage with two small patches of grass. Ms. Gray's children and her grandson accompanied her. Sierra Gray and her son remained living there until October or November 2007. Since then, Sierra Gray has lived close by but has no current plans to resume residing with her mother.
39  Sierra Gray testified about her mother's financial pressures brought on by her marital separation and her reduced employment income. At one point, she loaned her mother the sum of <damage type = "other">$3,000</damage>, which her mother has repaid, in part, by babysitting her grandson.
(c) Ms. Gray's Return to Work
40  Ms. Ann Gavey has been the clinical leader for home and community care in Parksville and the surrounding areas since February 2006. She is Ms. Gray's direct supervisor at VIHA. She described Ms. Gray's competency as a nurse in very favourable terms. Ms. Gavey explained that Ms. Gray "owns" her 0.7 permanent part-time position which requires 50.4 hours of work bi-weekly. A full-time position involves 72 hours bi-weekly.
41  Ms. Gavey testified that it is open to Ms. Gray to pick up extra shifts beyond the 0.7 work allotment that she owns. The evidence is clear that certain additional shifts, such as those worked on statutory holidays, weekends and evenings are paid at a premium. For financial reasons, Ms. Gray has often taken on extra shifts over and above her dedicated 0.7 allotment since returning to work in the summer of 2006.
42  Although Ms. Gray experienced even further improvement in her left arm and hand after she returned to work, she maintains that she has been aware of a persistent lingering feeling of "something" in her left arm. She says that when she overuses her left arm, hand or wrist, she very often pays a price. She claims that increasing her work shifts in excess of her permanent part-time allotment frequently results in a strain or overuse of her left arm, wrist and/or hand. This, in turn, causes left arm, wrist and/or hand symptoms of discomfort, pain and a global achiness and heaviness. Ms. Gray testified that there have been instances where her left arm overuse symptoms have prevented her from taking an extra shift or finishing a shift at work. In the latter instances, she has taken the missed time as vacation or drawn on her sick leave, if available. She recalled times when her sick leave bank was depleted and she therefore treated her work absence as an unpaid leave.
43  Ms. Gray also testified that certain non-work activities can give rise to her left arm, hand or wrist overuse symptoms of pain and discomfort. She described lifting and carrying her growing grandson as a movement that has become increasingly aggravating. He is now a toddler and in order to pick him up, she has to position him on a chair or kneel down to collect him.
44  Ms. Gray claims that she has learned to pace herself as best she can at work and outside of work in order to maximize her symptom-free functioning. She has modified how she performs certain tasks in order to accommodate, to the extent she practically can, the limitations that flow from her susceptibility to overuse strain. Even so, she finds that the actions of daily life place an unavoidable strain on her left arm, especially when she has worked extra shifts. She testified that even today, she finds driving her standard vehicle a physical challenge that, on occasion, can strain her left arm.
45  According to Ms. Gray, she has routinely suffered from these overuse symptoms since her return to work and they persist today.
46  My overall assessment of Dr. Maccari's evidence is that it supports Ms. Gray's complaints of overuse symptoms. He reports that she has experienced intermittent difficulties stemming from the overuse of her left upper limb with a variable degree of left arm, hand and wrist aches and pains.
47  Approximately two-and-a-half months after her return to work, Ms. Gray reported to Dr. Maccari that she was experiencing symptoms of pain, achiness and heaviness triggered by overuse at work of her left arm, wrist and/or hand. Her complaints accorded with Dr. Maccari's evaluation of her condition at that time. She voiced similar complaints when she next saw Dr. Maccari on September 21, 2006. On examination, he found tenderness of her left lateral epicondyle, her left forearm extensor muscles, her trapezius and her neck base. He assessed myofascial connective symptoms in her left arm due to left upper limb overuse. That is a soft tissue injury. VIHA's payroll records indicate that during the last week of August and the first two weeks of September 2006, Ms. Gray had picked up several additional hours of work.
48  Ms. Gray's overuse symptoms had improved somewhat when she was next seen by Dr. Maccari on October 16, 2006. Notably, she had reduced her work hours in mid-October. During her appointment with Dr. Maccari on November 16, 2006, she reported that she was working about 75% of full-time and that her left arm, elbow and hand felt "ok with this". She also described her left grip strength at that time as being "ok".
49  Dr. Maccari next examined Ms. Gray on April 5, 2007. She indicated that she had recently been working full-time hours with increased pain. He found mild tenderness of her left forearm extensor muscles, the extensor surface of her left wrist and the left lateral epicondyle near her elbow. Dr. Maccari diagnosed his findings as left lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow, left forearm extensor muscle strain (strain of the muscles responsible for the extension of the hand and wrist), and left wrist extensor tendonitis. He also noted a small amount of residual weakness in Ms. Gray's left forearm and wrist from overuse. He clarified that these diagnoses were not present before the Injection in January 2005.
50  Ms. Gray once again complained of overuse strain when she saw Dr. Maccari on May 25, 2007. She testified that she had been absent from work for two days on account of her overuse symptoms. On examination, Dr. Maccari did not find tenderness at her left wrist or the back of her forearm. However, rapid flexion/extension of her fingers produced an ache at her left radial wrist area. Dr. Maccari observed that a forced extension of her upper arm caused an ache in her left triceps. His assessment at that visit was inflammation of the left triceps area. In cross-examination, Dr. Maccari agreed that Ms. Gray's triceps had been spared from direct injury as a result of the Injection. However, he went on to explain that in his opinion, if an individual's lower arm has weakness, the triceps can become overused as a means of compensating for such weakness, which can lead to soft tissue problems.
51  Dr. Maccari explained that due to the pressing time constraints of his busy practice, he would not have necessarily recorded all of Ms. Gray's ongoing soft tissue symptoms on every visit.
52  Dr. Maccari was aware that Ms. Gray's workload fluctuated. He knew that at times she worked her dedicated part-time hours or less, and at other times picked up extra shifts which, at times, resulted in her working the equivalent of full-time, or close to it. He testified that during some of Ms. Gray's visits, he raised the prospect of her reducing her work hours and number of shifts. He did so out of a concern for her medical fitness to work increased shifts which approached a full-time pace. His recollection was that Ms. Gray would typically acknowledge the legitimacy of his expressed concerns, but she would explain that she had to work as much as possible for financial reasons.
53  In early 2008, Ms. Gray was given an employment opportunity to become the community nurse manager in the remote northern community of Klemtu. I accept that she had always been interested in working as an outpost nurse. It was a part-time position that she had in mind she would assume in conjunction with her part-time employment at VIHA. She was not certain exactly how time consuming the Klemtu posting would prove to be. She testified that she would have liked to work there about seven days of each month, although she acknowledged that the frequency may have tapered off based on the needs of the community. Ms. Gray arranged to take an unpaid leave of absence from VIHA to explore the Klemtu opportunity. She believed that she could handle the position physically because she had experienced a relatively "good run" coping with her symptoms in the six to seven months before the offer.
54  Ms. Gray's first visit to Klemtu spanned four days in January 2008; it was largely administrative in nature. She returned in February 2008 for another trial period of seven days. She worked long hours for seven days straight, performing a multitude of tasks expected of an outpost community nurse, such as wound care, chronic ailment management, medical specialist liaising, patient charting, and office work. Ms. Gray testified that the physical demands of that week took a significant toll on her left arm. She experienced increased pain and some left arm weakness. She took off four scheduled shifts from her regular job at VIHA in order to recuperate. It was clear to Ms. Gray that her left arm could not cope with the demands of the Klemtu position. In March 2008, she briefly returned to Klemtu to finish her obligations. I accept that having to decline the career opportunity in Klemtu was quite emotionally difficult for Ms. Gray.
55  Ms. Gray consulted Dr. Maccari on March 31, 2008. She had not seen him about her left arm symptoms for approximately ten months. During the March 31 appointment, Ms. Gray complained of pain and weakness in her left hand and wrist. It is Dr. Maccari's view that the symptoms Ms. Gray reported on March 31 were related to her myofascial difficulties resulting from the effects of the Injection.
56  The defence asserts that the ten-month interval between appointments with Dr. Maccari indicates that Ms. Gray was basically symptom-free during that time frame. The Hospital contends that if Ms. Gray had been genuinely suffering from overuse symptoms, she would have seen her doctor more regularly.
57  Ms. Gray testified that she had felt much better for months preceding the Klemtu assignment in January 2008. She further explained that she did not make an appointment to see Dr. Maccari every time her symptoms of discomfort were triggered by overuse because she understood that there was not much he could do for her beyond renewing her prescriptions for anti-inflammatory medication. She had consulted him relatively regularly in the early stages of her injury and in the fall of 2006 after her return to work when she says that her overuse symptoms developed. With the foregoing in mind, and having regard to the fact that Ms. Gray claims to suffer from a chronic, inoperable condition that comes and goes and is routinely treated by symptom relief that does not require a physician to administer, and given that Ms. Gray is herself a registered nurse with personal knowledge and experience in relation to pain management, I find her explanation for the ten-month interval between her appointments with Dr. Maccari to be perfectly reasonable.
58  Ms. Gavey testified that she had been made aware that it was physically difficult for Ms. Gray to carry out her obligations at Klemtu and perform her duties at VIHA. She also testified that she has not encountered any discipline issues with respect to Ms. Gray apart from one instance where Ms. Gray had missed her shifts over a weekend in around March 2008. She cannot recall any work absences on Ms. Gray's part that stand out; however, she noticed that Ms. Gray used an elevated amount of sick time. She chose not to speak to Ms. Gray about it because she knew that she was involved in this litigation.
59  Ms. Gavey admitted that she did not have much interaction with Ms. Gray. However, she does recall seeing Ms. Gray favouring her left arm, keeping it close to her body, and picking up items with her right hand while at the office. Ms. Gray has never complained directly to Ms. Gavey about her ability to do her job.
60  In describing her current complaints, Ms. Gray testified about being aware of an achiness or heaviness in her left arm all of the time. She intermittently experiences pain along the top of her left arm and below the elbow with an ache that can radiate to her upper arm. From time to time, she has painful flare-ups of her symptoms of tennis elbow and left wrist tendonitis which can produce swelling around her left wrist. The flare-ups appear to be connected to her overuse or strain of her left arm, hand or wrist. Her perception is that the strength of her left hand grip has not been fully restored. Occasionally, during the night, she gets a cramping sensation in her left arm, like a charley horse. She is not able to lay on her left side to fall asleep. At times, her left fingers want to curl in, especially while she rests. She copes with her symptoms by administering a combination of Advil, ice, heat, massage by family or self, rest, and hot baths.
61  Ms Gray was examined for discovery on October 12, 2006, soon after she had begun to experience her overuse symptoms. On discovery, she agreed that driving her standard car was a difficult aspect of her job and that she needed to get an automatic vehicle. At trial, Ms. Gray admitted that she was still driving a stick-shift. She testified that it was her "dream" car and that she did not want "to let everything go". The Hospital submits that her attitude and course of conduct in this regard is not reasonable. I agree that it may not have been entirely rational for Ms. Gray to persist in driving her standard vehicle in the face of her awareness that it presented difficulty. However, the evidence was not adequately developed on the point so as to found a cogent basis for a finding of a failure to mitigate. Ultimately, I conclude that nothing of importance turns on this evidence.
62  Ms. Gray has not applied for a permanent full-time position with VIHA. She is concerned that if she were to do so, she would simply be setting herself up for continuous re-injury. She believes that she could better manage and cope with her left upper limb symptoms brought on by overuse if she were to work at a part-time pace at her current level of 70% of full-time.
(d) The Medical and Functional Capacity Experts
63  In support of her case, Ms. Gray tendered the expert reports of Dr. Maccari and Dr. Tessler. She also relies on the report of Russell McNeil, an occupational therapist and certified work capacity evaluator. Those experts testified at trial (Dr. Tessler, by way of deposition).
64  The only evidence tendered by the Hospital was the expert evidence of Dr. Robert Keyes, a neurologist.
65  There is no controversy among the physicians that as a direct result of the Injection, Ms. Gray sustained a left radial nerve injury. The injury site is located just after the nerve supply has gone to the triceps muscle and has descended the level of the spiral groove in her mid posterior upper left arm. The abnormalities affecting her left radial nerve were due to the mechanical and toxic effects of the Injection. There is also agreement among the physicians that the left radial nerve dysfunction caused Ms. Gray significant left upper limb sensory and motor symptoms, including weakness.
66  All of the physicians share the view that the extent of Ms. Gray's recovery is remarkable; indeed, they describe it as miraculous. There is consensus as well that she no longer experiences any sensory abnormality in her left arm, wrist, hand, or fingers.
67  The Hospital concedes that the Injection has left Ms. Gray with a permanent very mild to mild residual weakness of the extensor muscles of her left forearm, wrist, hand and fingers and as well as the extensor muscle of the elbow. That is not the point of contention. The main issue that divides the medical experts is whether Ms. Gray's complaints of the symptoms that she attributes to the strain or overuse of her left arm, wrist and/or hand are causally linked to the Injection induced radial nerve injury.
Dr. Tessler
68  Ms. Gray's treating neurologist, Dr. Tessler, last examined her on November 27, 2007. He had not seen her for slightly more than year. She relayed to Dr. Tessler the symptoms of discomfort arising from the overuse of her left arm, wrist and hand. She complained of experiencing left arm muscle spasms and occasional neuralgic pain. Dr. Tessler pointed out that neuralgic pain, which emanates from the nerve, is different from pain related to a soft tissue injury. He described it as a "very disagreeable type of pain". Ms. Gray further reported that although her left hand grip was good, it was not as strong as it had been previously. As well, she recounted the incident of tripping, which had revealed a delayed reaction time in her left arm.
69  Dr. Tessler found that while Ms. Gray's left hand had good grip and mobility, her left grip was not as strong as her right. He noted that she had difficulties with endurance, that is sustained repetitive movements, and needed to take breaks to give her arm a rest. No doubt relying on what Ms. Gray reported to him, Dr. Tessler noted that there had been interference with her recreational activities. In his view, she is not able to kayak because the sustained movements over time cause her discomfort and some fatigue, secondary to pain.
70  Dr. Tessler believes that, from time to time, Ms. Gray may experience discomfort that will have to be treated symptomatically. In his opinion, as a result of the Injection, Ms. Gray has been left with a permanent mild partial disability. He thinks she is capable of working as a community nurse, a position he noted did not involve the sustained lifting of patients. In his view, she is also able to look after her home, but may require help periodically with heavier duties, such as gardening. In this context, Dr. Tessler commented that if Ms. Gray needs to do any heavy lifting or carrying, she would have to rely on her normal right side in the event she developed discomfort.
Dr. Keyes
71  Dr. Keyes has seen many patients with radial nerve and other nerve abnormalities caused by problematic intramuscular injections, and patients who experience pain, weakness, and numbness in their extremities. He explained that as a neurologist, his role is to determine whether a neurological abnormality exists for a patient's symptoms. If he is not able to discover a neurological abnormality for the symptoms, the diagnosis is often ligament dysfunction or tendonitis.
72  In his report, Dr. Keyes discusses the physiology of Ms. Gray's nerve injury in considerable detail. None of his general observations were disputed by Drs. Maccari or Tessler. According to Dr. Keyes, Ms. Gray's left radial nerve abnormality involved both the myelin (insulation around the nerve) and the axons (nerve fibers). He explained that the radial nerve contains both sensory and motor nerve fibres. It, therefore, has both sensory and motor functions in the arm. The radial nerve supplies sensation to the back of the upper arms, forearms, hands, fingers and thumb, and supplies motor functions to all of the muscles of extension in the arm. Those extensor muscles are all located on the back of the upper arm and forearm. The extensor muscles of the mid to lower posterior forearm send tendons to the back of the wrist, fingers and thumb that allow for extension or straightening of the wrist, hand, fingers, and thumb. Normal function of these extensor muscles is required to stabilize the joints of those structures during their flexion movements. Therefore, patients with abnormalities of the radial nerve can experience difficulties with hand grip, finger and thumb flexion (curling to the palm), and pincer grasp (bringing the thumb and index finger together).
73  Dr. Keyes conducted an independent clinical neurological assessment of Ms. Gray on January 14, 2008. Among other things, she reported decreased left arm strength generally and in the left hand, wrist and fingers. She complained of decreased grip strength in her left hand with weakness on flexion and extension of her left wrist and fingers, and diminished response time of her left arm. Ms. Gray also told Dr. Keyes that she experienced decreased strength with the pinching of her left thumb and index finger, as well as tenderness and pain in her left elbow. She informed him of the symptoms brought on intermittently by overuse since her return to work.
74  Dr. Keyes found nothing in his examination of Ms. Gray on that day to explain the left arm symptoms that she attributes to overuse. He noted no signs of tenderness anywhere in Ms. Gray's left upper limb, including the outer part of her left elbow. Nor did he find decreased left hand grip strength, although Dr. Tessler had done so, or decreased leftsided pincer grasp strength or clinical signs of tennis elbow.
75  Dr. Keyes remarked that certain of Ms. Gray's complaints, such as weakness of finger flexion, presented as normal on examination and were not functions related to the radial nerve in any event. He agreed that swelling at the wrist would be consistent with a diagnosis of tendonitis. Ms. Gray believed that she had reported to Dr. Keyes the left wrist swelling that she had experienced and had previously reported to Dr. Maccari. However, Dr. Keyes' recollection is, and his report notes, that Ms. Gray denied any swelling in her left wrist, forearm, hand, or digits.
76  Dr. Keyes took great care, both in his written report and in his testimony, to emphasize that at the particular time he examined Ms. Gray, he had not detected her overuse symptoms. In cross-examination, he agreed that certain of her symptoms, such as swelling, may simply not have been present at the time that he carried out his examination. Similarly, he agreed that in cases of subacute tendonitis, which can be chronic, abnormalities may not be detected on a clinical examination. In considering Dr. Keyes' findings on his examination, it is important to bear in mind that Ms. Gray does not complain of unrelenting extensor muscle tenderness or constant wrist tenderness or swelling; rather, she says that her symptoms come and go. They may not have been perceptible at the time of Dr. Keyes' examination.
77  Dr. Keyes did identify certain deficits in the motor function of Ms. Gray's left upper limb caused by the radial nerve damage. He found very mild to mild weakness affecting the extensor muscles of her left wrist, hand, fingers and thumb. The degree of that weakness was in the range of approximately 85% to 95% of normal. He also discovered weakness of the left brachioradialis, one of the extensor muscles of the elbow supplied by the radial nerve. He estimated the strength of that muscle to be approximately 90% to 95% of normal. In addition, he noted a mildly diminished left brachioradialis reflex. He further noted that Ms. Gray's reports of weakness of grip strength and pincer grasp were indirectly due to the very mild to mild weakness in the extensor muscles of her left wrist, hand, fingers and thumb, supplied by the left radial nerve.
78  Dr. Keyes' opinion is that Ms. Gray's very mild to mild left radial nerve weakness is a permanent residual dysfunction. He regarded it as highly unlikely that she would experience any recurrence or additional left radial nerve motor dysfunction in the future.
79  In Dr. Keyes' opinion, the mild degree of Ms. Gray's residual left arm radial nerve motor dysfunction was insufficient to implicate any causal relationship between it and her tennis elbow, or any other secondary joint, tendon or ligament abnormality in Ms. Gray's left upper limb. He remarked that tennis elbow is a common condition that almost invariably occurs in the absence of any associated arm peripheral nerve dysfunction. It may be brought on by repetitive or unaccustomed movement. While Dr. Keyes did not say so directly, what his remarks imply is that Ms. Gray's tennis elbow was caused by certain work or non-work activities, or a combination of them, unrelated to the effects of the Injection.
80  Dr. Keyes agreed that Ms. Gray's very mild to mild weakness in her radial nerve distribution could result in a very mild degree of decreased endurance and increased fatigue associated with rugged sporting events that require the use of both arms, like kayaking. Other than that, his view is that there were no self-reported symptoms or identified general medical or clinical neurological signs that would lead him to conclude that Ms. Gray would be restricted in any less strenuous sporting activities or in her usual day-to-day activities. During the course of his cross-examination, it became evident that Dr. Keyes knew very little about the kinds of activities in which Ms. Gray had engaged before the Injection, or that she had used her left hand to play tennis and shoot pool.
81  Throughout his report, Dr. Keyes stated repeatedly that despite Ms. Gray's minimal residual weakness, she has been able to perform all aspects of her duties as a community nurse without restrictions. That statement may be accurate in a narrow sense; however, it fails to address the larger picture. Ms. Gray's allegation is not that she is unable to perform her tasks at work per se; rather, the nub of her complaint is that when she overuses her left arm, wrist and/or hand, whether during her work or outside of work, she is susceptible to episodic flare-ups of soft tissue symptoms that cause her discomfort and pain. The preponderance of the evidence establishes that she has intermittently experienced these overuse symptoms when she works at a pace at some point beyond her regular 70% shift allotment.
Dr. Maccari
82  It is Dr. Maccari's opinion that since Ms. Gray's return to work in June 2006 and persisting to the time of trial, she has suffered from a partial disability due to her tennis elbow, left extensor muscle strain and left wrist extensor tendonitis. He maintains that all three diagnoses are related to the overuse of Ms. Gray's left upper limb and that none were present prior to the Injection. He states his opinion in his report dated April 15, 2007, as follows:
I feel that during the period of time from her original injury in January 2005 until June 2006 despite treatment with splints and physiotherapy that Ms. Gray suffered some degree of permanent loss of muscle mass and hence strength in her left arm, wrist and hand. When she returned to work in June 2006, her work-related activities caused these overuse injuries. However, I feel that the left radial nerve damage caused by the January 24, 2005 injection in turn caused persistent weakness to the extensor mechanism of her left hand, wrist and forearm which was responsible for these overuse injuries once she returned to work. This left distal arm extensor muscle weakness has persisted and likely will continue indefinitely. In other words, this partial disability will likely continue indefinitely, to some extent, and Ms. Gray will likely continue to experience flares of her left distal forearm and wrist pain and weakness as a result of left arm and hand activities at work or at home.
83  Dr. Maccari was not surprised by Ms. Gray's reports of overuse symptoms shortly after her return to work. He clarified that when he had stated that she "should" be able to return to work in June 2006, he was hedging his bets and had not been absolutely sure.
84  Dr. Maccari is cautious about the scope of Ms. Gray's future work capacity. He believes that she will need to restrict her work as a nurse to permanent part-time indefinitely in order to prevent chronic left arm pain and disability. He also believes that despite a restriction in her work activities, she may require periods of time off work in the future to treat acute flare-ups of her left arm inflammation, a condition he termed as "acute on chronic". As well, Dr. Maccari predicts that Ms. Gray will likely need to permanently limit her home and recreational activities that require the use of her distal left arm. He noted that whereas before the Injection, Ms. Gray was able to use her left arm freely for such activities, she would likely have to pay attention to the degree of her activities, such as picking up her grandson, performing housework, and gardening, now and into the future in order to prevent triggering acute flares of her overuse symptoms with resultant pain and disability. It is Dr. Maccari's view that Ms. Gray will benefit from some degree of ongoing massage therapy and/or physiotherapy to treat episodes of acute symptom flare-ups.
85  Dr. Maccari agreed that he would defer to Dr. Keyes' expertise on issues pertaining specifically to nerve and nerve function. However, he was not prepared to defer with respect to soft tissue injuries. He believes that he has more experience than a neurologist in diagnosing musculoskeletal disorders. It is a routine component of his general practice. Moreover, Dr. Maccari emphasized that it has never been his view that the Injection directly caused Ms. Gray's soft tissue difficulties. He persuasively explained that Ms. Gray compensated for the Injection induced injury to the motor functions of her left arm, by recruiting other muscles to perform tasks that they would not ordinarily perform. That muscle recruitment process put her at risk for soft tissue injury.
86  The significant difference between the opinions of Dr. Maccari and Dr. Keyes turns on their respective views of the impact of Ms. Gray's mildly weakened extensor muscles. In Dr. Maccari's view, Ms. Gray's weaker muscles do not always work optimally. When she is performing activities that would normally engage her slightly weaker extensor muscles, her body may recruit other muscles or muscle groups to compensate for that weakness. According to Dr. Maccari, that compensatory process can trigger Ms. Gray's overuse symptoms of inflammation, swelling, pain, and global achiness and heaviness. He likened it to a domino effect in the body.
87  Dr. Keyes accepts that one cannot consider muscles in isolation; he concedes that if one part of a muscle group is not being used as intended, then the entire muscle system may be negatively affected and may cause soft tissue symptoms. He also agreed with the general proposition that accessory muscles would be engaged in physical movements that would ordinarily use damaged or weakened muscles.
88  As noted earlier, Dr. Maccari had observed muscle atrophy of Ms. Gray's left upper limb when he saw her on June 15, 2005. In his view, during the seventeen month period between the time of the Injection and Ms. Gray's return to work, she suffered some degree of permanent loss of muscle mass with resultant loss of strength in her left arm, hand, and wrist. Dr. Keyes agreed that Ms. Gray would have lost muscle mass from the paralysis of her left arm. He deferred to Dr. Maccari's observation of Ms. Gray's muscle atrophy made at a particular time. He further agreed that an overused muscle can over-develop and increase in bulk, a condition referred to as hypertrophy, being the opposite of atrophy. However, in his examination, Dr. Keyes found that Ms. Gray's left arm muscle tone, bulk and circumference were normal and symmetrical when compared to her right.
89  I have concluded that the evidence pertaining to Ms. Gray's muscle bulk in her left arm is not determinative in the assessment of whether her overuse symptoms are causally connected to the extensor muscle weakness. Specifically, in my view, the fact that Dr. Keyes did not identify any loss of muscle mass when he examined Ms. Gray's left arm is not, of itself, sufficient to discredit Dr. Maccari's core opinion that her episodic overuse symptoms are the result of the residual weakness to her left arm extensor mechanism, and the compensatory muscle process that this weakness, in all likelihood, engages.
90  Dr. Maccari had diagnosed Ms. Gray's left wrist tendonitis long before she returned to work. In cross examination, Dr. Keyes agreed that some, though not all, patients can develop tendonitis during the nerve regeneration process. In this regard, he clarified that as a nerve regenerates, one can only actively move the muscle or muscles related to that nerve to the extent of the regeneration. He explained that whether that process would result in tendonitis would depend on many factors, such as the degree of weakness in the affected muscle or muscle group. He did not expand the point much beyond that statement. Dr. Keyes agreed that Ms. Gray's complaints of pain during her recovery were consistent with tendonitis. While he agreed that she could have developed tendonitis during the recovery from her nerve injury, he believes that because her extensor muscles were only minimally weak by the time she returned to work, any subsequent tendonitis would be unconnected to that muscle weakness. In the end, Dr. Keyes would not agree that Ms. Gray's current soft tissue overuse symptoms are related to difficulties with the functioning of her weakened extensor muscles caused by the misplaced Injection.
Mr. McNeil
91  On September 5, 2007, Mr. McNeil spent several hours assessing Ms. Gray's present capacity to perform her work as a registered nurse and her overall capacity to complete functional activities. As part of his assessment, he administered a battery of functional tests. Those included tests of her range of motion, upper extremity strength, vertical and horizontal reaching capacity, and grip and pincher strength. He did not give Ms. Gray any tests involving lifting or carrying. He also administered additional tests aimed at gauging Ms. Gray's effort in performing movements and reliability in self-reporting pain. In Mr. McNeil's opinion, the test results provided a reliable measure of Ms. Gray's physical capacity.
92  Mr. McNeil's testing revealed a variety of restrictions in relation to Ms. Gray's capacity to reach, grip, pinch, and handle things. He found that she consistently demonstrated restrictions in her capacity for activity requiring vertical reaching and horizontal reaching using her left arm. He noted measured restrictions in her upper extremity strength. He also found restrictions in her mobility and general endurance.
93  In his report, Mr. McNeil concluded that Ms. Gray demonstrated the capacity to perform activities that require modified light level strength. In his opinion, she had shown the capacity to perform her work as a community nurse on a full-time basis. However, he stated that there were restrictions in her work capacity and that she would continue to require accommodations, including being able to pace herself, in order to work both part-time and full-time. Mr. McNeil remarked further that Ms. Gray's left arm restrictions would likely continue to interfere with two-handed tasks.
94  Dr. Keyes was taken through portions of Mr. McNeil's report. He pointed out that Ms. Gray had reported restrictions of certain functions of muscle movements that were not supplied by the radial nerve. Those included curling her fingers, grip and pinching, left wrist flexion, elbow flexion, and reaching overhead. She also reported a demonstrated weakness in the small intrinsic muscles of her left hand. She had variously reported a number of these symptoms to Drs. Maccari, Tessler and Keyes.
95  Among other things, Ms. Gray described her gripping and pinching ability to Mr. McNeil as "severely restricted". By Mr. McNeil's definition, a severe restriction indicates a movement that is interfering and prone to be avoided and that requires extra breaks and the need to shift after 15-30 minutes. Ms. Gray had evidently not described the intensity of her left grip and pinch in such extreme terms to Dr. Maccari, Dr. Tessler, or Dr. Keyes.
96  Mr. McNeil agreed that he did not understand all aspects of Ms. Gray's job as a community nurse. For that reason, he was not able to assess whether the restrictions that he had measured of her functioning capacity were slight, moderate, or severe.
III. DISCUSSION
97  The onus rests with Ms. Gray to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that but for the Injection she would not experience the symptoms of pain and global achiness and heaviness triggered episodically with the overuse of her left arm, hand and/or wrist.
98  Ms. Gray was a credible and reliable witness. She was forthright and direct in giving her testimony and notably candid in answering questions on cross-examination. Cross-examination of her revealed possible discrepancies in terms of the symptoms she reported to various physicians and experts across time. I find, however, that to the extent there were inconsistencies, they were of a minor nature and taken together, do not detract from Ms. Gray's overall credibility or the reliability of her evidence. Specifically, I do not find that Ms. Gray magnified the nature, frequency, or intensity of her overuse symptoms or revised the truth to advance her litigation objectives.
99  I believe that Ms. Gray has been suffering intermittent symptoms of pain and global achiness and heaviness in her upper left limb since her return to work. I am satisfied that they are probably triggered by the overuse of her left arm, wrist and/or hand, predominantly, although not exclusively, when she takes on extra work shifts that approach or are equivalent to a full-time work pace. I find as well that these symptoms continue to plague Ms. Gray currently and accept her evidence about the detrimental effect they have had on her life.
100  Drs. Maccari and Keyes concur that damage to the left radial nerve can produce symptoms of discomfort and pain in muscles that are not innervated by the damaged nerve. This can occur as a result of accessory muscle use, when muscles innervated by the damaged nerve are not performing optimally. In Ms. Gray's case, there is some evidence that this compensatory process engaged early on, as the radial nerve repaired. Dr. Keyes' essential opinion is that Ms. Gray's current soft tissue complaints are wholly unrelated to the significant left radial nerve sensory and motor dysfunction brought on by the Injection which has left her with a permanent mild residual left-sided extensor muscle weakness. A proposition that logically flows from his opinion is that it is purely coincidental that Ms. Gray now experiences chronic left arm, wrist and hand symptoms. Before receiving the Injection, Ms. Gray had no difficulties with her left arm, wrist or hand despite engaging in a broad range of intense physical activities, leisure pursuits and work that involved her left upper limb. While I recognize that the manifestation of a medical condition may not correlate well or even at all with common sense, and acknowledge the dangers inherent in applying simple temporal reasoning when determining legal causation, in the circumstances of this case, I have great difficulty accepting the absence of a causative link between Ms. Gray's left radial nerve injury and its residual effects, and the onset of her chronic condition.
101  A fundamental factual issue is whether Ms. Gray's mild to very mild residual extensor muscle weakness resulting from the Injection induced radial nerve injury, has caused her soft tissue overuse symptoms. In addressing this issue, the focus is on the manner of response of Ms. Gray's musculoskeletal structure to the radial nerve injury and her minimally weakened extensor muscles. Dr. Maccari had not encountered a patient with a radial nerve injury before Ms. Gray. However, he has extensive experience, which I accept is greater than Dr. Keyes' experience, dealing with patients who suffer from tendonitis and other soft tissue conditions. Dr. Maccari has provided a fulsome and nuanced analysis of the probable cause of Ms. Gray's chronic left arm overuse symptoms. I accept his thesis that Ms. Gray's left radial nerve injury and residual permanently weakened left extensor muscles have given rise to her chronic soft tissue condition through the compensatory muscle recruitment process that he described. In my view, the fact that Ms. Gray has experienced intermittent pain in muscles that are not innervated by the radial nerve is also adequately explained by Dr. Maccari's opinion regarding the use of compensatory muscles flowing from her extensor muscle weakness.
102  I find that it is probable that, had Ms. Gray not received the Injection, she would not have experienced or continue to experience the left upper limb overuse symptoms. Because her residual weakness is permanent, I find that Ms. Gray's chronic condition will likely not change or improve by any remarkable measure.
(a) Non-Pecuniary Loss
103  The objective of non-pecuniary damages is to compensate a plaintiff's pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. The essential principle, articulated in a variety of ways, is that fairness and reasonableness of the amount of an award is measured by the adverse impact of the particular injuries on the particular individual plaintiff. Consequently, while fairness is assessed by reference to awards made in comparable cases, it is "impossible to develop a tariff": Lindal v. Lindal,  at 637, . In the end, each case is decided on its own unique facts: Kuskis v. Tin,  [Kuskis]; Noriega v. Lewars, . Because it is not entirely possible to restore a plaintiff to her original position by an award of money, the process is one of assessment and not of mathematical precision.
104  In Stapley v. Hejslet,  at para. 46, , Kirkpatrick J.A. enumerated a non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered in awarding non-pecuniary damages. They include: the plaintiff's age; the nature of the injury; the severity and duration of the pain; disability; emotional suffering; loss or impairment of life; impairment of family, marital and social relationships; impairment of physical and mental abilities; and loss of lifestyle.
105  The initial manifestation of Ms. Gray's left radial nerve injury was profound and disabling. It was devastating and "changed everything" in her life in a negative way. She was unable to dress herself or attend fully to her own personal care. She was no longer able to participate in the recreational activities that she enjoyed or many of the leisure and domestic pursuits that she found so satisfying. For a considerable period of time, she was forced to confront the distressing prospect of suffering significant and irreversible sensory and motor dysfunction of her left arm, hand and fingers. She has endured soft tissue pain as well as "very disagreeable" neurologic pain. Her compromised ability to be the wife she once was proved to be the straw that broke her fractured marriage.
106  Dr. Maccari perceives Ms. Gray to be a stoic woman who is not prone to show much distress or emotion. He testified that she responded more emotionally to this ordeal than she has to any other matter for which she ever consulted him.
107  Fortunately, Ms. Gray has experienced remarkable recovery. But it is not a full recovery. She has been left with a permanent residual weakness of her left brachioradialis muscle and the extensor muscles of her left forearm, wrist, hand and fingers and a diminished brachioradialis reflex. Although her weakness is classified as mild and very mild, it is not benign. As well, the fact that Ms. Gray's extensor muscle weakness ranges between mild and very mild does not necessarily mean that the level of pain that she has experienced in the past or will likely suffer episodically in the future, will be likewise minimal or mild. The two do not invariably march hand in glove.
108  Ms. Gray's overuse symptoms mostly arise when she takes on extra shifts and, thereby, works more than 70% of full-time; however, they can also be triggered by her non-work activities, or through a combination of work and non-work overuse. Even when her symptoms are not active or painful, they interfere with Ms. Gray's life to some extent. This is because on her days off from work, she feels that she must take extra care to restrict her activities to some degree or avoid them outright in order to preserve the functioning of her left arm for work.
109  I accept that the lifestyle changes brought on by Ms. Gray's divorce and the sale of the Coombs property have impacted the kinds of activities available to her at the present time. Regardless, the dominant consideration must be that because of her injuries stemming from the Injection, Ms. Gray will not be able to undertake certain activities that she once enjoyed or take up certain new activities in the future, without exposing herself to the risk of triggering flare-ups of her symptoms, which may cause her pain and may result in temporary wage loss. She has also lost confidence to participate in more rigorous activities such as kayaking. The quality and enjoyment of Ms. Gray's life have been changed in various ways and by varying degrees across a wide range of activities, by the ill-effects of the Injection.
110  Shortly after Ms. Gray began to report her overuse symptoms to Dr. Maccari, he recommended that she seek treatment from a physiotherapist and from a massage therapist to relieve her acute symptoms. She did not do so after about October 2006. Ms. Gray's evidence is that her financial circumstances were too tight to cover those costs. She also testified that her daughter provided massage on a relatively regular basis while they lived under the same roof. As Sierra Gray's life became busier with the arrival of her son and the start of a full-time job in September 2006, she found it increasingly difficult to find the time to give regular massages to her mother. Her recollection was that she last gave her mother a massage approximately one month before this trial. On that occasion, her mother had worked a long day and was complaining of pain in her left arm. I find Ms. Gray's explanation for not following Dr. Maccari's recommendations after October 2006 to be truthful and regard it as legitimate. In closing submissions, counsel for the Hospital raised the issue of Ms. Gray's failure to seek those treatments. It was not entirely clear as to whether in doing so, the defence is asserting a failure to mitigate on Ms. Gray's part. To the extent that it is purporting to do so, I reject it. The Hospital has not discharged its onus to prove that Ms. Gray failed to mitigate her loss in that way or in any other respect.
111  Having reviewed the authorities provided by Ms. Gray and the Hospital, and having considered the totality of the evidence pertaining to Ms. Gray's specific circumstances, I conclude that a fair and reasonable award for non-pecuniary damages is <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$80,000</damage>.
(b) Past Income Loss
112  There is no quarrel between the parties that Ms. Gray suffered income loss as a result of the Injection from the date that she would have otherwise returned to work following her hysterectomy, which I find was March 7, 2005, until her return to work on June 21, 2006. Ms. Gray claims the sum of <damage type = "other">$55,228.50</damage> for that period. The Hospital concedes that calculation is accurate so long as it does not include reimbursement for the sick leave taken while she convalescenced from her hysterectomy.
113  The evidence establishes that there are nine levels, or steps, of pay rates for nurses pursuant to the terms of their applicable collective agreement. An employee generally ascends the steps annually on her seniority date and thereby receives an increase to her base salary. Wanda Best, payroll coordinator at VIHA, testified that had Ms. Gray not taken a leave of absence due to the Injection, she would have progressed through the various steps differently. Due to her leave of absence, Ms. Gray lost approximately eight months of seniority. This affected and continues to affect her progression through the prescribed pay rates. That loss has been factored in as a component of the sum of <damage type = "other">$55,228.50</damage>.
114  Ms. Best confirmed that Ms. Gray also received a decreased signing bonus on account of her missed work. That loss is <damage type = "other">$581.74</damage>. It is accepted as compensable by the defence.
115  Ms. Gray also seeks damages in respect of losses of the following:
vacation accrual - <damage type = "other">$2,700.67</damage>;
qualification differential - <damage type = "other">$1,044.41</damage>;
shift and weekend differential - <damage type = "other">$484.00</damage>;
sick bank accrual - <damage type = "other">$273.06</damage>;
missed step increment - <damage type = "other">$2,852.92</damage>;
time missed from work between June 22, 2006, and April 16, 2007 - <damage type = "other">$3,283.43</damage>;
loss of opportunity to work full-time hours/past loss of capacity - not quantified.
116  In the course of the trial, counsel advised that that the parties had agreed on the sum of <damage type = "past wage loss">$60,000</damage> as damages to compensate Ms. Gray for her past income loss. The Court was not provided with a detailed breakdown of the various elements comprising this agreed figure.
117  In accordance with the parties' agreement, Ms. Gray is entitled to an award of <damage type = "past wage loss">$60,000</damage> in compensation for her past income loss.
(c) Loss of Future Earning Capacity
118  Ms. Gray is seeking damages for her diminished earning capacity in the future, attributable to the injuries that she says she will likely continue to suffer into the future as a result of the Injection. Her essential contention is that the prospect of working as a nurse on a full-time basis has been foreclosed to her on account of the Hospital's negligence. Ms. Gray asserts that due to her chronic condition caused by the Injection, she can comfortably work part-time hours only, and at most the equivalent of 70% of full-time.
119  The Hospital accepts that Ms. Gray has suffered a very mild or mild permanent injury to her left arm and that, as such, her "capital asset" has been mildly impaired. It further concedes that, as a result, Ms. Gray is now precluded from working full-time in the areas of nursing which involve more strenuous physical duties than those in community care nursing. The defence urges a modest award for Ms. Gray's loss of future earning capacity, in the range of <damage type = "other">$22,000</damage>, on the premise that her episodic overuse symptoms are not causally linked to her left radial nerve injury. In the alternative, the Hospital submits that if Ms. Gray's overuse symptoms have been caused by the Injection, an award of <damage type = "other">$35,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$50,000</damage> would amply compensate her under this head.
120  The issue here is whether Ms. Gray's future earning capacity has been impaired or diminished by the injuries she sustained by the negligence of the Hospital. If it has, then the Court must look at the companion issue of what amount, in light of all the evidence, should she be awarded as compensation for that impairment. Because this is a future loss, Ms. Gray need only prove the realistic or substantial possibility, as distinct from a probability, that owing to her injuries caused by the Injection, her earning capacity has been impaired.
121  The law has long recognized that unknown contingencies and uncertain factors make it impossible to calculate lost future earning capacity with any precision. It is because the occurrence of future events is unknown, that allowances must be made for the contingency that the assumptions underlying a proposed award may prove to be wrong. Accordingly, the process of quantification in respect of any impairment is one of assessment based on the evidence, taking into account all relevant positive and negative contingencies:
Milina v. Bartsch  (B.C.S.C.); Rosvold v. Dunlop, ,  [Rosvold]; Reilly v. Lynn  (B.C.C.A.); Durand v. Bolt, , .
122  In Palmer v. Goodall  at 59 (C.A.), Southin J.A. made the following clarifying remarks in relation to the concept of future impairment:
Because it is impairment that is being redressed, even a plaintiff who is apparently going to be able to earn as much as he could have earned if not injured or who, with retraining, on the balance of probabilities will be able to do so, is entitled to some compensation for the impairment. He is entitled to it because for the rest of his life some occupations will be closed to him and it is impossible to say that over his working life the impairment will not harm his income earning ability.
123  In determining whether Ms. Gray's earning capacity has been impaired, the court will consider factors such as whether she has been rendered less capable overall of earning income from all types of employment; is less marketable or attractive as a potential employee; has lost the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities that might otherwise have been open; and is less valuable to herself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour market: Brown v. Golaiy  (S.C.); Kuskis.
124  The Hospital contends that upon returning to work in June 2006, Ms. Gray was able to, and in fact did, work full-time hours on a relatively consistent basis. That overstates the situation somewhat. Ms. Gray testified that there were periods of time in which she picked up several extra shifts so as to be working the equivalent of a full-time position and, on occasion, more than full-time. Although Ms. Gavey was "pretty sure" that Ms. Gray's shifts corresponded to full-time, Ms. Gray credibly testified about periods of time where she did not work full-time hours. She also clarified that there were instances when she was not even able to work her 70% allotment on account of her overuse symptoms. The evidence establishes that regular full-time earnings of a registered nurse such as Ms. Gray would be just under <damage type = "other">$70,000</damage> annually as at the date of trial. However, that figure does not take into account the premium rates of pay for shifts worked on evenings, weekends or statutory holidays, or higher rates of pay for select nursing positions such as outpost nursing. Ms. Gray routinely worked the holiday, weekend and evening shifts having the premium rates of pay and had attempted, but failed, to assume an outpost position. The payroll records in evidence must be read carefully if used to determine Ms. Gray's true pace of work because they include in the tabulation of her hours worked, the notional addition of hours attached to premium shifts, even though those hours were never actually worked. A similar caution applies to the treatment given to Ms. Gray's gross earnings as reflected in her recent income tax returns.
125  In my assessment, the evidence indicates that after her return to work in June 2006, Ms. Gray's hours fluctuated. In any given week, they at times fell below or were equal to her 70% allotment, and at other times, likely the majority of times, fell within a range of greater than 70% and full-time equivalency. I think it is fair to say that when her hours of work came within that latter range of between 70% and 100%, they frequently approximated full-time hours. A fundamental point that must not be lost is that where Ms. Gray was working close or equal to full-time, she would frequently pay the price in the sense of suffering an episode of overuse symptoms.
126  Donna Townsend is the ability management consultant for VIHA. Her first involvement with Ms. Gray came about in March 2008 when a supervisor brought to her attention that Ms. Gray had been absent for four work shifts. Ms. Townsend had a discussion with Ms. Gray and determined that no further action was required because Ms. Gray demonstrated to her a solid understanding of when she was able to work extra shifts over and above her regular rotation.
127  Ms. Townsend confirmed that there is a high need in all areas of nursing, including non-patient care areas, and that there would likely be full-time opportunities for Ms. Gray in less physically demanding nursing jobs. She noted that some nursing positions do not involve patient care or prolonged typing, or are in the midst of replacing typing with the use of a computer mouse. Presumably Ms. Gray would use her dominant and unaffected right arm in manipulating the mouse. Ms. Gavey similarly testified that there are continually job postings for full-time nursing postions in VIHA which are not as physically demanding as community nursing. She testified that if Ms. Gray wanted to she would probably be able to find a less physically demanding full-time nursing job within a year.
128  Ms. Townsend gave important evidence about the scope of VIHA's duty to accommodate an injured nurse under the terms of their collective agreement. She explained that Ms. Gray was entitled to request a job accommodation in relation to difficulties she was experiencing performing the duties of her permanent part-time position. Due to the nature of Ms. Gray's duties as a community nurse, Ms. Gavey does not believe that she would be able to accommodate Ms. Gray in her current position. In any case, it is clear that that duty to accommodate would not extend to any new full-time position that Ms. Gray might obtain. Therefore, if Ms. Gray were hired in a fresh nursing position and it transpired that she was not able to fully perform her requisite duties because of the same difficulties, she would not be entitled to an accommodation by VIHA. If it turned out that her former 70% position had been filled by another nurse in the meantime, then that position would be lost to Ms. Gray. Ms. Townsend's evidence revealed that Ms. Gray would assume a gamble of sorts if she were to leave her current permanent part-time position and apply for a permanent full-time nursing posting. I do not regard the degree of that risk to be insignificant.
129  Ms. Gavey also spoke to the fact that if Ms. Gray were to apply for a full-time nursing position in VIHA, she would be required to complete a form for the prospective area manager. On the form, Ms. Gavey would be obligated to record Ms. Gray's current difficulties, which the prospective hiring manager would no doubt take into account in determining whether to hire Ms. Gray. A medical certification of fitness from Ms. Gray's physician might be required as a pre-requisite to Ms. Gray being hired for the new position.
130  Defence counsel made much of the fact that Mr. McNeil holds the opinion that Ms. Gray is capable of working full-time. I agree that his opinion is worthy of careful consideration. In looking at it closely, it is clear that he qualified his opinion in important respects. Mr. McNeil noted that there are restrictions in Ms. Gray's overall work capacity, that she will continue to need accommodations at work and that her left arm restrictions will likely continue to interfere with two-handed tasks. His view is that she would require accommodation if she worked both full-time and part-time.
131  Mr. McNeil admitted that he did not know all aspects of Ms. Gray's job as a community nurse. He had based his opinion as to her functional capacity for work, in part, on the NOC code for a registered community nurse, which categorizes the level of such work as being sedentary to light. Ms. Townsend, who has a better appreciation of the physical demands of Ms. Gray's job, confirmed that there was no heavy lifting involved in community care nursing. However, she also testified that VIHA used a classification of moderate to heavy, not sedentary to light, in respect of Ms. Gray's position.
132  Mr. McNeil did not express optimism in terms of the vocational alternatives available to Ms. Gray within the nursing profession. He states that if she were no longer working in community nursing, her options for nursing would be limited given the ongoing physical restrictions that he identified. In his view, she would not be capable of working as a nurse in extended care, post surgical care, cardiac care or surgery due to her restricted strength and stamina. The evidence of Ms. Townsend and Ms. Gavey about the breadth of employment opportunities in nursing open to Ms. Gray must be considered with Mr. McNeil's opinion in mind.
133  As mentioned earlier, Dr. Maccari's opinion is that Ms. Gray must restrict her work as a nurse to part-time for an indefinite period and that even with such a restriction she may require periods of time off work in order to treat acute flares of her left arm symptoms.
134  I do not accept that Ms. Gray will only be able to work as a nurse the equivalent of 70% of full-time until her retirement as a result of her Injection related limitations. The evidence supports a finding that she is likely able to work something more than 70% but less than 100% of a full-time community nurse position without triggering her overuse symptoms. It is not possible to pinpoint with exactitude where on the spectrum of work intensity between 70% and 100% of full-time, Ms. Gray's tolerance threshold may lay. My assessment of the evidence is that there is a substantial possibility that she is and will be able to continue to work as a community care nurse at a pace greater than 70% without the risk of triggering the overuse symptoms. I do not, however, accept that she is able to work on a full-time basis or closely approximating that pace, without likely triggering her symptoms episodically. There is also a prospect of Ms. Gray being able to move into a nursing position that is more administrative in nature however, there is no guarantee that the demands of those positions will not trigger flare-ups of her overuse symptoms. Moreover, as pointed out by Ms. Gavey and Ms. Townsend, a change of course to a new nursing position entails a level of risk to Ms. Gray. There is evidence as well that Ms. Gray's functional work capacity may be lower with respect to certain other nursing positions, such as the Klemtu posting and those identified by Mr. McNeil, and that some kinds of nursing positions are simply no longer open to her.
135  In my view, the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates an impairment of Ms. Gray's future earning capacity and that it is likely that her impairment will harm her earning ability into the future. The Injection has rendered Ms. Gray less capable overall of earning income from all types of employment; less marketable or attractive as a potential employee and has taken from her the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities that might otherwise have been open to her. She is entitled to compensation for that impairment.
136  Mr. Robert Carson, a consulting economist, provided calculations intended to assist the Court in the evaluation of Ms. Gray's future economic loss. He estimated that her annual earnings in regular full-time work would have been equal to approximately <damage type = "other">$69,900</damage>. That figure included a modest qualification differential applicable to Ms. Gray because she holds a bachelor's degree, but excluded shift differential pay, acting pay, overtime or promotion.
137  Mr. Carson provided a table of multipliers for use in the calculation of the present value of any pattern of future earnings loss. The mortality risk relative to a B.C. female is the only contingency built into those calculations. He did not deduct for other non-voluntary or for voluntary work force contingencies. Mr. Carson also provided, in a separate table, the present value of sample earning streams of Ms. Gray. According to Mr. Carson's figures, the present value of the difference in income between Ms. Gray working full-time and working 70% until retirement at age 65 is <damage type = "other">$352,525</damage>.
138  Valuation of a future loss may take the form of comparing the respective income streams of what Ms. Gray would probably earn but for the Injection, with what she will probably earn in her injured state. However, as noted by the Court of Appeal in Rosvold, that comparison is not conclusive: the overall fairness and reasonableness of the award must also be considered.
139  Mr. Carson noted that the risks of unemployment and of being unable to work on a full-time basis are very low among nurses. He further remarked that the earnings of nurses are subject to health risks because the work is somewhat physically demanding. At the same time, however, he explained that the effects of health risks are largely offset by benefit coverage provided under the collective agreement. Mr. Carson did not take into account in his calculations of sample earnings streams, the probability of Ms. Gray choosing to reduce her hours of work. His rationale is that there are factors at play in Ms. Gray's circumstances that would tend to reduce the likelihood of her either choosing to work part-time or deciding to leave the paid workforce. Those factors include the fact that Ms. Gray had elected to enter a career in nursing relatively late in life, that her children were now grown, that her marriage had recently ended and that she is self-supporting. In this connection, Ms. Gray testified that about three years before receiving the Injection, she had worked full-time for under a year. She stopped because she found the pace to be "too much" and opted instead to work 70%.
140  The defence appears to suggest that Ms. Gray does not truly intend to work full-time as a nurse and that it is unlikely that she will do so at any future time. It asserts that she would prefer instead to maintain her permanent part-time position and pick up extra shifts as she likes in order to be free to regularly care for her grandson once or twice per week. I see the evidence quite differently. When Ms. Gray decided to stop working full-time her children were much younger and still attending school. I accept her testimony that her plan had been to resume work on a full-time basis once both of her children graduated from high school. As it turned out, more urgent financial pressures brought on by her divorce accelerated her need to work more than 70% somewhat earlier than when her youngest child graduated in 2007. Ms. Gray has demonstrated a genuine intention to work as close to a full-time pace as she was physically able from time to time since her return to work following the Injection.
141  Mr. Carson testified about the difference in pension benefits that Ms. Gray will receive if she continues to work on a part-time basis into the future as opposed to working full-time. He admitted that the amount of her pension loss was relatively small in the overall scheme.
142  In applying the relevant legal principles, taking into account the case authorities presented by each side and using my judgment as best I can on the totality of the evidence, I conclude that, in all the circumstances, the sum of <damage type = "sub-future wage loss">$160,000</damage> is a fair and reasonable measure of Ms. Gray's loss of future earning capacity. To that figure I would add the sum of <damage type = "sub-future wage loss">$9,000</damage> which I conclude represents adequate compensation for the negative effects on Ms. Gray's pension.
(d) Cost of Future Care
143  I find that it is more likely than not that Ms. Gray will require physiotherapy and massage therapy periodically to assist in the treatment of episodic flare-ups of her overuse symptoms into the future. Her counsel estimates the cost of those therapies would amount to <damage type = "other">$400</damage> per year.
144  Dr. Maccari's opinion is that Ms. Gray will also need some assistance with housework and home maintenance activities indefinitely. Dr. Tessler indicated that Ms. Gray may only require help periodically with heavier duties such as gardening. The garden at her current home consists of two little grass patches. Ms. Gray's counsel submits that she will require approximately <damage type = "other">$2,300</damage> per year for yard work and home maintenance that she can no longer do herself. Even if she were to move to a larger property with a yard and/or garden, I consider the quantum of that aspect of the claim to be excessive.
145  The purpose of awarding damages for the cost of future care is to compensate for a financial loss reasonably incurred to sustain or promote the mental and/or physical health of an injured plaintiff. The cost must be justified as reasonable in the sense of being medically required or justified, and in the sense that the plaintiff will be likely to incur them based on the evidence. In Kuskis, the court summarized the relevant principles in relation to a claim for cost of future care at paras. 163-164:
An award for the cost of future care is notional and imprecise in nature: Strachan (Guardian ad Litem of) v. Reynolds, . The court must consider evidence regarding what care is likely in the injured person's best interest and calculate its present cost, with appropriate adjustment for contingencies in all of the circumstances of the case: Courdin v. Meyers, .
146  I am satisfied that an award for future cost of care aimed predominantly at covering the costs of physiotherapy and massage to treat episodic flare-ups are reasonably justified. Using Mr. Carson's cost of care multipliers, I have determined that an award of <damage type = "future care">$ 8,000</damage> is fair and adequate.
(e) Special Damages
147  Ms. Gray seeks special damages in the amount of <damage type = "other">$6,275.51</damage>.
148  The Hospital argues that a small reduction of the component of her claim that covers ferry travel ought to be made to reflect the fact that she sometimes combined a trip to the lower mainland to attend medical appointments with visiting her family in Maple Ridge. I am satisfied that the primary purpose for the incurrence by Ms. Gray of the ferry fares was to attend legitimate medical appointments arising from her injuries related to the Injection. The fact that she elected to coordinate visits with her family during some of those trips, does not convert those expenditures into non-compensable damages.
149  Ms. Gray is awarded the sum <damage type = "special">$6,275.51</damage> for special damages.
(f) Other Matters
150  Ms. Gray's in-trust claim has not been proved and is dismissed.
151  In the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreement on costs, Ms. Gray's counsel is at liberty to file written submissions within 60 days of these reasons. Counsel for the Hospital is to file submissions in response within 45 days of receipt of plaintiff's submissions. Any reply submissions are to be filed within 15 days thereafter.

Action by a motorist for damages for personal injuries sustained in a car accident. In January 2011, the plaintiff collided with the defendant's vehicle when the defendant turned left in front of her. Shortly after the car accident, the plaintiff began feeling pain in her neck, shoulders and upper back and she developed a headache. She was eventually diagnosed with a whiplash associated disorder. She received massage therapy, physiotherapy and chiropractic treatments for her injuries. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was 26 years of age. She was married with no children. She was an aspiring professional triathlete and a PhD student. She also worked as a teaching assistant. Prior to the accident, the plaintiff suffered some sports-related injuries, but nothing that prevented her from training. Following the accident, the plaintiff had trouble keep up with the readings for her courses and her school performance suffered. In addition, she found sitting at her computer, which she used for work, very painful. She took one week off from training after the accident, and then gradually because a reduced training regimen. In the three or four months post-accident, her condition improved, but did not resolve. In May 2011, the plaintiff crashed while competing in an Ironman race. She suffered road rash and a concussion, but did not experience any aggravation of her prior injuries. She took an 11-month leave of absence from her PhD studies in October 2011 and concentrated on recovery. She gradually resumed training and work, but later discontinued her athletic training to focus on her recovery and her studies. In addition to interfering with her school work and training, the plaintiff alleged that her injuries interfered with her ability to do household work and affected her relationship with her husband and friends. The plaintiff sought compensation for her personal injuries and the associated pain and suffering, past loss of income, future loss of income, cost of future care, special damages and costs. The defendant admitted liability and that the plaintiff suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck, but argued that her injuries were resolved when he recovery was complicated by injuries she suffered the bike crash following the accident and that any ongoing injuries were attributable to the bike crash. 

HELD: Action allowed.
 As a result of the car accident, the plaintiff suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck, shoulders and upper back and developed myofascial pain syndrome, chronic pain syndrome, cervical facet arthropathy and left hip girdle pain. Her injuries continued to affect her and forced her to give up her career as a professional athlete and delayed her PhD studies. The bike crash did not exacerbate her injuries and did not contribute to her various pain syndromes. However, the concussion the plaintiff sustained in the bike accident contributed to her deconditioning, which led to left hip girdle pain. In addition, it resulted in the plaintiff's decision to not compete in triathlons during the summer of 2011, but did not contribute to her decision to take a leave of absence from her studies. The plaintiff's injuries had a significant impact on her life, caused her intense pain and interfered with her relationships, her athletics and her studies. The plaintiff was entitled to non-pecuniary damages of <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$130,00</damage>, reduced by <damage type = "reduction">$10,000</damage> to reflect the possibility that deconditioning associated with the concussion caused some of her pain. In addition, the plaintiff was entitled to <damage type = "past wage loss">$13,200</damage> for past loss of income from being a teaching assistant and prize money and <damage type = "future wage loss">$86,500</damage> for loss of future earning capacity associated with the delay in her career and the loss of prize money. The plaintiff was also entitled to costs of future care of <damage type = "future care">$12,302</damage> for physiotherapy, massage therapy, chiropractic treatments, an athletic therapist, pain medications, an ergonomic assessment and yoga and special damages of <damage type = "special">$35,683</damage>.

Reasons for Judgment
L.A. WARREN J.
INTRODUCTION
1  Amy Kirkham seeks damages for personal injuries she suffered in a car accident on January 5, 2011. She claims that she injured her neck, shoulders, upper back, and left hip in the accident, and that she now suffers from myofascial pain syndrome, cervical facet arthropathy, left hip girdle pain, and chronic pain syndrome, all of which has disabled her from competing as a professional triathlete and delayed her PhD studies by one year. She seeks compensation for her personal injuries and the associated pain and suffering, past loss of income, future loss of income, cost of future care, special damages, and costs.
2  Liability has been admitted. The defendant also admits that Ms. Kirkham suffered soft tissue strain to her neck in the car accident but takes the position that her injuries were resolving when her recovery was complicated by injuries she suffered in a bike crash while competing in a triathlon four and one-half months after the car accident, and that any ongoing symptoms and disability are attributable to the bike crash.
ISSUES
3  The primary issues are (1) causation with respect to the various injuries Ms. Kirkham claims she sustained in the car accident and which she asserts continue to affect her; (2) the impact, if any, of the subsequent bike crash on those injuries, and (3) the amount of damages to which she is entitled under various heads of damage.
BACKGROUND
Before the car accident
4  Ms. Kirkham was 26 years old at the time of the accident. She lives with her spouse, David Stephens, who is an elite cyclist. She has no children.
5  Ms. Kirkham is an accomplished young woman. In the years prior to the car accident, she pursued athletics and academics with uncommon discipline, dedication, and determination. At the time of the accident, she was an aspiring professional triathlete and a PhD student who effectively balanced her studies and her sport.
6  Ms. Kirkham graduated from York University in June 2008 with a Bachelor of Science degree in kinesiology. She then moved to Vancouver and completed a Master of Science degree in exercise psychology at UBC. In September 2010, Ms. Kirkham commenced her PhD studies in rehabilitation sciences at UBC. Her work is in the field of cardiovascular and exercise oncology, with a focus on the impact of breast cancer chemotherapy on the cardiovascular system.
7  At the time of the accident, Ms. Kirkham was four months into her PhD program. In addition to course work, she also worked as a teaching assistant. She devoted at least 40 hours per week to her PhD studies, with much of that time spent working on a computer. Dr. Kristin Campbell, a professor who supervised Ms. Kirkham's Master's Degree and is supervising her PhD, testified that Ms. Kirkham's performance during her Master's and the first term of her PhD was very good.
8  Ms. Kirkham has been a competitive runner since the age of 12. She was on the varsity running teams at York University and received several awards. She began competing in triathlons in 2007, eventually focussing on the half-Ironman distance, which consists of a 1.9 km swim, a 90 km cycle, and a 21.1 km run.
9  In 2009, Ms. Kirkham joined the Leading Edge Triathlon Club, a performance- oriented private club for triathletes, and started training under a coach named Alan Carlsson. Mr. Carlsson described Ms. Kirkham as a very motivated and professional athlete.
10  By 2010, Ms. Kirkham was competing as an elite triathlete, which meant she was eligible for prize money. In 2010, she had several podium performances (finishing in the top three) in half-Ironman races. She acknowledged that she had not yet arrived as one of Canada's leading triathletes but she was getting there. According to Mr. Carlsson, in 2010, Ms. Kirkham was moving into the top level of triathletes.
11  Encouraged by her success in 2010, Ms. Kirkham decided to try to qualify for the half-Ironman World Championship to be held in September 2011. To qualify, she had to accumulate points based on her performance in a series of half-Ironman races referred to as the "70.3 Series". She planned to compete in several 70.3 Series races in 2011, with the first scheduled for Puerto Rico in March.
12  Prior to the car accident, Ms. Kirkham was following an intense physical training regime. She devoted approximately 20 hours a week to a rigorous schedule of biking, swimming, running, and weight training. She trained six days a week, for up to five hours a day, split between a morning and evening workout.
13  In addition to training, Ms. Kirkham saw a chiropractor, Dr. Jonathan Gerrard, approximately three times a month for what Dr. Gerrard referred to as "performance care". He described this as consistent care directed at enhancing athletic performance and preventing injury by treating the subtle changes to the tissues that result from intensive physical training.
14  Prior to the car accident, Ms. Kirkham suffered some sports-related injuries but she never had an injury that prevented her from training. None of the medical experts considered Ms. Kirkham's pre-car-accident health to have contributed to the injuries she suffered in the car accident or to her current condition.
15  Prior to the car accident, Ms. Kirkham's social life revolved around her athletics, with most social occasions consisting of training with other high-level athletes. Ms. Kirkham's friends, Amy Schneeberg, Sabrina Wilkie, and Robert Johnson, described Ms. Kirkham as hard-working, driven, goal-oriented, motivated, confident, and incredibly fit. Ms. Schneeberg, a long-time runner and PhD student herself, testified that she and Ms. Kirkham would do 16 km runs together before school. Ms. Wilkie, an elite distance runner, described Ms. Kirkham as a "super keen" person, for whom school was the first priority and training a close second. Mr. Johnson, an elite triathlete who trained with Ms. Kirkham, described her as upbeat and committed to her sport.
16  As already noted, Ms. Kirkham's spouse, Mr. Stephens, is also an elite athlete. They met on an athletes' dating website. Prior to the accident, their lives were dedicated to sport and work. Mr. Stephens described Ms. Kirkham as intensely focused on her PhD studies and her triathlon training. They spent most of their time together participating in physical activities such as lengthy bike rides. Even their vacations revolved around athletics, including a trip spent cycling in the mountains in Spain.
The car accident: January 2011
17  At approximately 4:45 pm on January 5, 2011, Ms. Kirkham was driving westbound on West 16th Avenue in Vancouver on her way to a training session at UBC. She entered the intersection at Pine Street on a green light and the defendant, who was traveling eastbound on West 16th Avenue, turned left in front of her. The front of Ms. Kirkham's car hit the passenger side rear door of the defendant's car. Although Ms. Kirkham applied her brakes before the collision, the impact was sudden and hard. Ms. Kirkham was wearing her seatbelt. The airbags in Ms. Kirkham's car deployed.
18  Ms. Kirkham's car would not start following the accident and had to be towed away. Ms. Kirkham was driven home by a police officer. Ultimately, the car was written off.
Effects of the car accident: January to early May 2011
19  Shortly after the accident, Ms. Kirkham began feeling pain in her neck, shoulders, and upper back, and she developed a headache. The next day, the pain was more intense. She went to see Dr. Gerrard, who noted her chief complaints as right neck pain, bilateral posterior shoulder/upper trapezii pain, and mid-scapular pain. On examination, he noted tenderness, muscle spasm, increased muscle tone and taut bands in the neck, upper back and shoulder areas, and significantly reduced cervical range of motion in all six directions (flexion, extension, right rotation, left rotation, right lateral flexion, and left lateral flexion).
20  Dr. Gerrard administered two questionnaires, the Neck Disability Index and the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index, which are intended to assess the degree to which pain is interfering with a patient's activities. Although both indices are based entirely on the patient's subjective responses to written questions, Dr. Gerrard considers them to be particularly useful for monitoring the progress of a patient's symptoms over time. Ms. Kirkham initially scored moderate to severe on the Neck Disability Index, which Dr. Gerrard calculated as a 50% disability. He calculated her low back disability at approximately 15% on the basis of the Oswestry Index.
21  In mid-January 2011, Dr. Gerrard recommended that Ms. Kirkham see a massage therapist and a physician. She started massage therapy with Tasha Stewart at UBC Massage Therapy Clinic and saw Dr. Hall, a general practitioner at a walk-in clinic. Dr. Hall recommended physiotherapy and Ms. Kirkham then started treatments at Treloar Physiotherapy.
22  Ms. Kirkham returned to the walk-in clinic approximately three weeks later and saw another general practitioner, Dr. Shiu. Dr. Shiu recommended that she continue with physiotherapy, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments, and he also prescribed a muscle relaxant. Ms. Kirkham followed Dr. Shiu's recommendations.
23  Ms. Kirkham struggled after the accident to keep up with the weekly readings for the two courses she was enrolled in. Her work required her to sit at a computer for significant periods of time and this was very painful. She made some adjustments to her equipment (for example, raising her laptop to eye level, getting a wireless keyboard and mouse, and raising her chair) in order to minimize the pain.
24  Ms. Kirkham took approximately one week off from training after the accident, and then gradually began again with a much-reduced regime. About a week after the accident, she started some indoor cycling sessions, which were much easier on her neck than outdoor riding because she could sit more upright and keep her neck in one position. Shortly after starting the indoor cycling, Ms. Kirkham added light swimming at about half the intensity that she had been doing before the accident and with frequent breaks. She modified her swim stroke to accommodate her neck pain and had to refrain from flip turns for a year because it prevented her from tucking her chin into the required position. At about the beginning of March 2011, Ms. Kirkham returned to gentle running, beginning slowly on a treadmill and gradually increasing her running time.
25  Ms. Kirkham got a new bike after the accident and had it modified to accommodate her modified position. She testified that since the accident, her left hip had been twisted forward and this necessitated adjustments because one foot rested further forward than the other.
26  During the three to four months following the accident, Ms. Kirkham's condition improved but did not resolve. She continued to have recurring pain in her neck, shoulders, and upper back. The physiotherapy, massage therapy, chiropractic treatments, and medication provided some relief but the pain interfered with her studies and her training. She was emotional and irritable from the pain and from her inability to train at her previous intensity.
27  A symptom diary that Ms. Kirkham kept indicates that she did have, even in January 2011, some good days. For example, the diary entry for January 15 states that she did a 70-minute bike workout in her aerobars (extended handlebars used by bike racers that reduce the rider's wind profile by lowering the rider's torso and keeping the rider's elbows in close to the body) without pain, but also without looking up. However, the diary also indicates she had very significant pain on January 17, 18, and 19, and she could not use the aerobars during a bike workout on January 23.
28  Mr. Carlsson testified that during the three to four months following the accident, Ms. Kirkham complained a lot about neck and back pain, which he said affected her posture and technique. He said her training progressed gradually over this period, but she was nowhere near where she had been before the accident in terms of intensity, volume, and technique.
29  Notwithstanding her pain, Ms. Kirkham assumed she would get better and was still hoping to accumulate the points she needed to qualify for the World Championship in September 2011. She persevered and continued to increase the volume and intensity of her workouts, most often working through the pain.
30  Ms. Kirkham cancelled a half marathon that she had planned to run in Vancouver in February. She also cancelled the 70.3 Series half-Ironman in Puerto Rico in March. However, after discussions with Dr. Gerrard, Ms. Kirkham decided to compete in a 70.3 Series half-Ironman in April 2011 in New Orleans.
31  Mr. Carlsson encouraged Ms. Kirkham to enter races in the spring of 2011. He described Ms. Kirkham as "competition-oriented" and said she needed the competition to stay motivated. He said the goal for the New Orleans race was just to finish it.
32  Ms. Kirkham saw a chiropractor in New Orleans before the race who taped her neck, which is something she had never done before. The swim portion of the New Orleans race was canceled due to high winds. The cycling portion was relatively easy and flat, but, during the final 45 minutes, Ms. Kirkham experienced significant neck pain and could see her power output dropping significantly. The pain was relieved when she started the running portion. Her symptoms did not worsen following the race, notwithstanding the pain she felt while cycling.
33  Ms. Kirkham's cycling and running times in New Orleans were similar to the times she had posted in half-Ironman events in 2010. Ms. Kirkham testified that in the circumstances, she was happy with her performance. However, she emphasized that she had been improving consistently at a rapid rate in all three triathlon disciplines in 2010. She considered she had a lot of potential for additional improvement and believed she would have significantly improved her times had it not been for the car accident.
34  Ms. Kirkham switched physiotherapists after the New Orleans race and started seeing Marilou Lamy on a weekly basis. On the first visit, on April 26, 2011, Ms. Kirkham told Ms. Lamy that although she considered herself approximately 50% recovered, she was not satisfied with her progress, she could not perform at the same training level as before the car accident, and she had difficulty sitting at the computer.
35  On examination, Ms. Lamy noted upper facet joint dysfunction of the upper cervical region as well as the mid/lower cervical area, with what she referred to as a link to the right shoulder and arm causing discomfort in those areas, and some neural tension. Ms. Lamy also noted restricted mobility in Ms. Kirkham's thoracic spine and left hip that seemed related to her neck in that when she worked on improving the mobility in the thoracic spine and hip area it also improved the neck mobility.
36  Ms. Lamy said that she thought not enough had been done to improve the strength and endurance in the muscles of Ms. Kirkham's neck, upper back, and pelvis and so she recommended Ms. Kirkham commence Pilates with a colleague named Stephanie McCann. Ms. Lamy and Ms. McCann worked together to tailor a program designed to increase Ms. Kirkham's muscular control.
37  On May 5, 2011, Ms. Kirkham started seeing Dr. D.R. Lloyd-Smith, a general practitioner specializing in sports medicine. Dr. Lloyd-Smith testified that when he first saw Ms. Kirkham, she told him that she had gradually increased her training to about 15 to 18 hours per week but was continuing to have pain. He diagnosed Ms. Kirkham with a whiplash associated disorder grade 2 with myofascial pain syndrome and recommended trigger point analgesic injections. Ms. Kirkham felt immediate relief upon receiving the first injections on May 6, 2011, lasting as much as a couple of weeks.
38  Ms. Kirkham's performance at school suffered immediately following the car accident. Dr. Campbell testified that in the period from January to April 2011, Ms. Kirkham was not physically present as much as she had been in the first term. Also, in Dr. Campbell's view, Ms. Kirkham was not making adequate progress with her main project and was missing deadlines. Dr. Campbell characterized Ms. Kirkham's performance during this time as unacceptable and out of character. She scheduled a meeting with Ms. Kirkham for May 26, 2011, to discuss Ms. Kirkham's performance in anticipation of submitting a formal annual progress report on Ms. Kirkham to UBC.
The bike crash: May 2011
39  Although Ms. Kirkham was still suffering from pain that impeded her training, she decided to participate in two half-Ironman races in May 2011. She said she made this decision after finding that her symptoms did not worsen after the New Orleans race. Dr. Gerrard, Dr. Lloyd-Smith, and Mr. Carlsson all supported this decision.89
40  Ms. Kirkham achieved a personal best time in the swim portion of the first race in Spain; however, her neck pain was very bad during the last hour of the cycling portion. Still, she recovered well following this race and was optimistic about the next one.
41  The second race was in Austria. The swim portion went well, but she suffered significant neck pain from the beginning of the cycling. She swerved while trying to pass another cyclist and crashed. She estimates she was traveling approximately 40 km/hour at the time of the fall. She hit her head and has no memory of the fall itself. She was taken to hospital by ambulance, where she remained overnight. She had road rash on her left shoulder, left chin, cheekbone, and neck, and was diagnosed as having suffered a concussion. She said she was initially concerned that she may have aggravated her neck and upper back injury and was relieved when she did not feel any change in her neck and upper back symptoms following the crash.
42  Ms. Kirkham left the hospital the day after the fall. She and Mr. Stephens spent a couple of days being tourists, as originally planned, and then returned to Vancouver. Mr. Stephens testified that during this time Ms. Kirkham had a bit of a headache, but she was generally fine and did not complain about any increased neck pain.
After the bike crash
43  On May 26, 2011, the day after she returned to Vancouver, Ms. Kirkham saw both Dr. Gerrard and Dr. Lloyd-Smith. Dr. Gerrard performed a neurological exam, palpated Ms. Kirkham's neck area, and did range of motion testing. He said he did not find any significant change to her car accident related injuries. Dr. Lloyd-Smith testified he found nothing new on physical examination to suggest the bike crash significantly affected her neck.
44  Also on May 26, 2011, Ms. Kirkham met with Dr. Campbell in anticipation of Dr. Campbell submitting an annual progress report on Ms. Kirkham to UBC. At the meeting, Dr. Campbell told Ms. Kirkham about her concerns regarding Ms. Kirkham's performance, which were subsequently reflected in the report she submitted in early June. Ms. Kirkham was devastated by Dr. Campbell's assessment. She said she had never had a bad report in her entire life.
45  After about a week off training immediately following the bike crash, Ms. Kirkham then commenced a regime significantly decreased due to her concussion symptoms. Between May and July 2011, she focused on indoor cycling. She resumed track running in August 2011. She did not compete in any races for the balance of 2011.
46  In June 2011, Ms. Kirkham was feeling depressed about the persistence of the neck pain and about having to significantly decrease her training and cancel a race due to the concussion. Dr. Lloyd-Smith suggested she see a counselor at UBC. Ms. Kirkham saw the counselor three times because that was the maximum number of visits UBC would provide.
47  In July 2011, on Dr. Lloyd-Smith's advice, Ms. Kirkham went to GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre, where she received some guidance for managing concussion symptoms. It was suggested that she take some time off her studies but she testified that by this time she felt that her concussion symptoms were on the way to resolution. Although she did not take any time off from her studies, her progress slowed over the summer due to her headaches and concentration difficulties.
48  Over the summer of 2011, Ms. Kirkham continued her physiotherapy, chiropractic treatments, massage therapy, and trigger point injections. She said her neck and shoulder symptoms remained about the same as they had been prior to the crash. Her concussion symptoms resolved.
49  Ms. Kirkham testified that she became overwhelmed in September 2011. The concussion symptoms had resolved but the injuries she sustained in the car accident were not improving. She was experiencing daily pain, which was exacerbated by working at the computer. She had not been working as a teaching assistant between January and September 2011, but returned to teaching in September which increased the demands on her time. She was continuing to attend many physiotherapy, chiropractic, and massage therapy sessions each week, which was time consuming. Her practitioners were recommending that she take on additional rehabilitation such as yoga but she had no time to do it. She was still feeling disappointed by Dr. Campbell's progress report. At an appointment with Dr. Lloyd-Smith in October she broke down.
50  Dr. Lloyd-Smith thought Ms. Kirkham's stress was impeding the healing of her neck injury. He said she needed to reduce her computer use because it exacerbated the neck pain. He recommended she take a leave of absence from school. Ms. Kirkham discussed the idea with Dr. Campbell and another academic mentor, both of whom were supportive. With that support, Ms. Kirkham reluctantly applied for and received permission to take a leave of absence from her PhD program from October 2011 to April 2012.
51  During the leave of absence, Ms. Kirkham considered the rehabilitation of her neck and back injury to be her job. She spent hours doing yoga, stretching, and strength training. She continued regular physiotherapy and chiropractic treatments and appointments with Dr. Lloyd-Smith. She reduced her computer use to a couple of hours per week.
52  In November 2011, Ms. Kirkham became ill with pneumonia. She was bed-ridden for two to three weeks and suffered lingering symptoms for a further few weeks. After she recovered from the pneumonia, she noticed that her pain seemed quite a bit better.
53  Ms. Kirkham said that by about January 2012 she was feeling quite well. Dr. Gerrard noted that by January 2012 her cervical range of motion had recovered in all directions except cervical extension.
54  In early 2012, Ms. Kirkham returned to some training with Mr. Carlsson. She started with cycling and, by February 2012, was doing about five hours a week of swimming, cycling, and running. She then suffered a flare-up of her neck symptoms. In April, on Dr. Lloyd-Smith's recommendation, she increased the dosage of her pain killers in the hope that it would allow her to increase her training volume and intensity. She gradually increased her training schedule through the spring; however, as noted by Dr. Lloyd-Smith, she then developed some left lateral knee and left hip pain.
55  In April 2012, Dr. Lloyd-Smith recommended that Ms. Kirkham extend her leave of absence for another term to the end of August 2012. He felt she had made progress but was not physically ready to go back to intense computer work. Ms. Kirkham was reluctant, but extended her leave of absence to September 2012.
56  Because she was concerned about having to suddenly return to her studies in September on a full-time basis, Ms. Kirkham took it upon herself to resume some computer work in May 2012. She gradually increased her computer use until August 2012, when she was managing four hours a day without any significant pain.
57  Ms. Kirkham continued to increase her training volume and intensity over the summer of 2012. She participated in a few races but no triathlons. She had some very good days but also days when the pain was bad, particularly when she pushed hard in workouts. She was still having difficulty sustaining the proper drop position while cycling, which required her neck to be extended for lengthy periods of time.
58  By August or September 2012, Ms. Kirkham was training at a level close to her pre-accident level. Dr. Lloyd-Smith's clinical record of September 27, 2012, indicates that Ms. Kirkham reported being pain-free 80% of the time. However, she could not get down into her aerobars while cycling and had difficulty looking up while swimming.
59  Mr. Carlsson testified that throughout 2012 it was apparent that Ms. Kirkham was still dealing with a lot of neck and back pain. He said her hours per week of training were inconsistent. When the pain increased, she had to reduce the training. He characterized her progress as one step forward, two steps back, two steps forward, one step back. Even though she was close to her pre-accident volumes of training, he considered that there was no noticeable pattern of improvement in her performance.
60  Mr. Stephens' evidence about Ms. Kirkham's progress throughout 2012 was similar to that of Mr. Carlsson. He testified that Ms. Kirkham did get back to a training volume that approached her pre-accident level but he said it went in waves. She would get the volume up and then have a flare-up in pain and decrease her training again.
61  Ms. Kirkham returned to her PhD studies on a full-time basis in September 2012. However, she became exhausted and discouraged by what she considered to be a lack of improvement in her athletic performance given she was back to her regular training volumes. In October or November 2012, she started having more significant hip pain.
62  In the fall of 2012, Ms. Kirkham started seeing another physiotherapist named Mr. Sean Campbell, who specializes in rehabilitating high level athletes. Mr. Campbell focused on reprogramming the ways Ms. Kirkham uses her muscles when she moves, which addresses the compensatory strategies she has developed as a result of the pain from her injuries. Mr. Campbell has also treated Ms. Kirkham with manual therapy, intramuscular stimulation or IMS (a needling technique similar to acupuncture), exercise, and taping. He testified that she has responded favourably to this treatment.
63  In the fall of 2012, Mr. Campbell and Ms. Lamy recommended that Ms. Kirkham stop her triathlon training and restrict her physical activities to physiotherapy, yoga, Pilates, and strength training. Mr. Campbell referred to this as a "therapeutic regime" to gradually increase her tolerance for both work and athletics. Dr. Lloyd-Smith agreed with this approach. Ms. Kirkham followed this recommendation, concluding she could no longer manage both her studies and the intense training required of an elite athlete.
64  Ms. Kirkham testified that she has been quite successful in her studies since giving up training and is on track to finish her PhD in August 2015. Dr. Campbell said Ms. Kirkham's performance in her studies since September 2012 has been very good.
65  On Ms. Lamy's recommendation, and with Dr. Lloyd-Smith's support, Ms. Kirkham saw a sports psychologist three times in late 2013. She canceled her last scheduled appointment with him as she felt she had made a fair amount of progress.
66  Ms. Kirkham testified that the injuries she suffered in the car accident not only affected her academics and athletics but also affected daily activities such as grocery shopping and homemaking. She said she still finds it difficult to lift things like grocery bags and laundry. She testified that she could not even do the dishes for the first couple of years following the accident, but as her pain has become more manageable, she has resumed some of these activities. She still avoids lifting because it causes pain.
67  Ms. Kirkham testified that the accident has affected her relationship with Mr. Stephens. She explained that she has been concerned that his feelings towards her will change because she has changed so dramatically. A passion for high level athletics is what originally brought them together. He had started dating a woman who was extremely athletic, confident, focused, and driven, and she has become someone else entirely. Her confidence suffered, her body image suffered, she was often emotionally upset, and this affected their relationship. While Ms. Kirkham's triathlon career suffered and ultimately came to an end, Mr. Stephens was excelling in his cycling career, and Ms. Kirkham had to work hard not to resent his success. He continues to train four to five hours on Saturday and Sunday mornings and she is left at home alone. Ms. Kirkham testified that both she and Mr. Stephens are not particularly interested in doing things for fun. They both wanted to focus on becoming the best at something. He is continuing to pursue that goal and she has been left behind.
68  Ms. Kirkham has been able to pursue some recreational activities, including recreational cycling. In December 2012, while on vacation with Mr. Stephens, Ms. Kirkham cycled up Mount Haleakal? on Maui, a 56 km "hill climb", which took about four hours. She explained that one sits more upright when cycling uphill and this is much easier on her neck. Because she is unable to sustain the bent-over body position that is required when racing or cycling downhill, Ms. Kirkham only cycled up Mount Haleakal?. Mr. Stephens met her at the top to drive her back down. In May 2013, Ms. Kirkham and Mr. Stephens spent six days at Mount Hood in Oregon, where they cycled and hiked.
69  Ms. Kirkham testified that the injuries she suffered in the accident have affected her relationships with her friends. She explained that all her friends are athletes and their time together was spent in athletic pursuits, particularly running. Her friends still plan trail runs and other adventurous activities, and Ms. Kirkham is left out. Ms. Kirkham's evidence in this regard was corroborated by her friends Ms. Schneeberg, Mr. Johnson, and Ms. Wilkie, who also testified about the changes they have witnessed in Ms. Kirkham's personality, from confident and upbeat to emotional and depressed.
70  Ms. Kirkham testified that it is hard for her to remain optimistic that she will ever compete in triathlon again. It has been more than three years since the accident and she finds it difficult to imagine she could ever return to compete at her previous level after losing that time.
71  At present, Ms. Kirkham's neck, shoulder, and upper back pain is manageable if she restricts her computer work to a normal workweek. Her pain flares up if she has to spend more than about ten hours a day at her computer, and also if she works at a location other than the office workstation that has been specifically configured. She resumed some track running in January 2014, but it exacerbated her pain. She continues to suffer from hip pain.
72  Ms. Kirkham continues to work with and follow the advice of Ms. Lamy and Mr. Campbell. She has reduced her chiropractic care because Mr. Campbell recommended greater focus on active treatments. She continues to participate in yoga, Pilates, strength training, and some track running and sees Dr. Lloyd-Smith for trigger point injections. She takes pain killers and muscle relaxants as prescribed by Dr. Lloyd-Smith.
73  Ms. Kirkham remains optimistic about her future academic life. Upon completing her PhD, she plans to do two or three years of postdoctoral study and then apply for a professorship.
MEDICAL EVIDENCE
74  Ms. Kirkham relied on medical reports written by Dr. Heather Finlayson (who conducted an independent medical examination of Ms. Kirkham at the request of Ms. Kirkham's counsel) and her treating practitioners, Dr. Lloyd-Smith, Dr. Gerrard, Ms. Lamy, and Mr. Campbell, each of whom also testified at trial. The defendant relied on medical reports written by Dr. Marc Boyle, who conducted an independent medical examination of Ms. Kirkham at the request of counsel for the defendant, and who testified via video deposition. A summary of the medical evidence is set out below.
Dr. Heather Finlayson
75  Dr. Finlayson is a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation. She also has a Diploma in sport medicine. She is a staff physician for the GF Strong Rehabilitation Centre Neuromusculoskeletal Rehabilitation Program, a consultant at Vancouver General Hospital, and a Clinical Assistant Professor in the UBC Faculty of Medicine. She is trained in the diagnosis, medical management, and rehabilitation of persons with spinal cord injury, acquired brain injury, general medical disorders, neurologic disorders, amputation, arthritis, soft tissue injuries, and musculoskeletal pain syndromes.
76  On November 21, 2013, Dr. Finlayson interviewed Ms. Kirkham and conducted a physical examination. She also reviewed the medical reports of Dr. Lloyd-Smith, Dr. Gerrard, and Ms. Lamy. It is Dr. Finlayson's opinion that as a result of the car accident, Ms. Kirkham is suffering from myofascial pain syndrome, cervical facet arthropathy, left hip girdle pain, and chronic pain syndrome.
77  Myofascial pain syndrome is a form of soft tissue injury where pain originates in muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia. Dr. Finlayson testified that this diagnosis was supported both by Ms. Kirkham's history of pain and stiffness beginning after the accident and by her own physical examination. Dr. Finlayson found taut bands of muscle in Ms. Kirkham's shoulder and neck areas on palpation, which Dr. Finlayson referred to as trigger points. She noted that Ms. Kirkham's positive response to trigger point injections supported her diagnosis of myofascial pain syndrome.
78  Cervical facet arthropathy is a condition in which pain originates in the facet joints of the neck. Dr. Finlayson testified that whiplash is a common cause of cervical facet arthropathy, as the movement of the neck causes strain on these small joints. She testified that the small ligaments become injured, leading to microscopic inflammation that is not visible on an x-ray. She said this condition is distinct from arthritis, which generally refers to changes to the joints themselves such as narrowing caused by wear and tear. She testified that cervical facet arthropathy can trigger myofascial pain syndrome.
79  Left hip girdle pain is pain from a muscle that extends across the buttock, from the base of the spine to the left side of the hip, and pain and tightness in a tendon that extends from the muscles around the hip down the side of the leg to the knee. Dr. Finlayson testified that this diagnosis is supported by Ms. Kirkham's subjective reports of pain and Dr. Finlayson's physical examination, during which she found tightness in this muscle and tendon complex. Dr. Finlayson's opinion is that Ms. Kirkham's left hip girdle pain "is probably a direct consequence of deconditioning, i.e., reduced strength and muscular endurance as a result of her reduced activity level following the MVA".
80  Dr. Finlayson's diagnosis of chronic pain syndrome was based on Ms. Kirkham's history of pain lasting for greater than three to six months that is associated with decreased mood.
81  In Dr. Finlayson's opinion, the car accident was "the primary material contributor" to each of these diagnoses and the bike crash was not a significant contributor. Her opinion was based primarily on the history relayed by Ms. Kirkham and the medical reports indicating that the neck, shoulder and upper back pain symptoms began following the car accident and were not worsened after the bike crash.
82  In cross-examination, Dr. Finlayson expressed the opinion that the forces that would be expected to pass through the neck following a car accident are different from the forces that would be expected to pass through the neck following a direct trauma to the head. Dr. Finlayson acknowledged that she does not know how Ms. Kirkham fell off her bike in Austria but maintained that a direct trauma to the head, alone, would not involve the same mechanism of injury as the car accident. I did not take Dr. Finlayson to be ruling out the possibility of a whiplash injury in a bike crash. Rather, I took her to be saying that the fact Ms. Kirkham suffered a concussion in the bike crash would not, without more, support a finding that the crash aggravated her neck injury.
83  Dr. Finlayson's prognosis is that it is "improbable that Ms. Kirkham will be able to resume her previous level of triathlon training and competition" and it is "improbable that she will achieve the same level of success and be able to gain sponsorship [as a triathlete] as she would have prior to the MVA". However, she was also of the view that there is potential for improvement in Ms. Kirkham's pain and her ability to engage in recreational level sports with continued physiotherapy at least one to two times per month (and perhaps up to four times per month) for the next year, assistance from a personal trainer or athletic therapist to oversee her training program for at least the next year, psychological support, and an ergonomic assessment of her home-based workstation. If there is no improvement in the left hip girdle pain with ongoing rehabilitation, then consideration should be given to corticosteroid injections and/or Botox injections. She also testified that it is not enough for Ms. Kirkham to exercise alone, and that she continues to require regular guidance from professionals.
84  The defendant raised many issues regarding Dr. Finlayson's evidence. I have considered all of them and none, in my view, detracts from the weight to be accorded to Dr. Finlayson's evidence. I will address some of those issues specifically.
85  First, the defendant submitted that Dr. Finlayson's report does not distinguish her opinion from Ms. Kirkham's version of what caused the complaints and injuries, because the instruction letter from Ms. Kirkham's counsel asked Dr. Finlayson to include in her report the history as relayed by Ms. Kirkham. I do not agree. There is nothing objectionable about counsel's request. A medical report like the one prepared by Dr. Finlayson must be based, in part, on the patient's subjective history. I note that counsel for the defendant told Dr. Boyle, in his letter, that he "may wish to append" to his report a "detailed account of interviews you have had with the plaintiff". There is no material difference between the two instructions. Further, and more fundamentally, Dr. Finlayson's report clearly distinguishes between her opinion, which is in the body of her report, and the history as relayed by Ms. Kirkham, which is contained in an appendix.
86  Second, the defendant pointed out that Dr. Finlayson relied on the reports of Ms. Kirkham's treating practitioners but was not provided with their clinical records. As a result, her opinions depend upon the accuracy of those reports. While this is true, the reports Dr. Finlayson relied upon were not shown to be inaccurate in any material way. For example, a form prepared by Dr. Gerrard for ICBC outlines dates that he provided treatment to Ms. Kirkham prior to the car accident. Dr. Gerrard explained that he did not include dates after May 2010 because he ran out of space on the form. The defendant submitted that this provided a skewed view to Dr. Finlayson because Dr. Gerrard treated Ms. Kirkham regularly up to December 2010. However, Dr. Finlayson also had access to Dr. Gerrard's report dated September 14, 2012, which expressly states that he treated Ms. Kirkham between March 2009 and December 2010. In any event, all the doctors, including Dr. Boyle, agreed that Ms. Kirkham had no significant pre-existing injuries. Thus, whether or not Ms. Kirkham saw Dr. Gerrard in the months just prior to the car accident is immaterial.
87  Third, the defendant notes that Dr. Finlayson did not have access to the diagnostic imaging reports that showed no evidence of clinically significant arthropathy. However, Dr. Finlayson's evidence was that her diagnosis of cervical facet arthropathy referred to microscopic inflammation that is not visible on an x-ray.
88  Finally, the defendant notes that Dr. Finlayson's diagnosis of myofascial pain syndrome was stated to be supported by Ms. Kirkham's positive response to trigger point injections. The defendant submits that Dr. Finlayson could not have known when the first of those injections were performed (and thus could not conclude that the bike crash was not a significant contributor to the pain) as the date was not indicated in Dr. Lloyd-Smith's report. However, Dr. Finlayson's report expressly notes that Ms. Kirkham told her that Dr. Lloyd-Smith performed the injections on several occasions starting "in about May 2011". The first trigger point injections were done on May 6, 2011.
Dr. D.R. Lloyd-Smith
89  Dr. Lloyd-Smith is a general practitioner specializing in sports medicine. He completed a sports medicine fellowship in 1983 and a diploma of sports and exercise medicine in 1985. He works as a sports medicine physician at the student health clinic and at a sports medicine centre at UBC. He is also a clinical professor in the Division of Sport and Exercise Medicine in the Department of Family Practice at UBC.
90  Dr. Lloyd-Smith has been Ms. Kirkham's treating physician since May 5, 2011. He diagnosed her with whiplash associated disorder grade 2 and myofascial pain syndrome as a result of the car accident and treated her with trigger point injections.
91  In Dr. Lloyd-Smith's opinion, the bike crash was not a significant contributor to Ms. Kirkham's ongoing symptoms. His opinion was based on the fact that once Ms. Kirkham's concussion symptoms improved, she returned to the same condition he had noted when he saw her on May 5, 2011. In cross-examination, he acknowledged that neck pain frequently co-exists with concussion, but denied that whiplash and concussion have similar mechanisms of injury. He said it is possible that a fall involving a concussion could also cause a neck injury, but maintained his view, based on her subjective report and his own physical examination after the bike crash, that Ms. Kirkham's neck injury was not aggravated by the crash.
92  Dr. Lloyd-Smith's prognosis is that Ms. Kirkham will return to pain-free normal daily activity and variable but manageable pain associated with her studies. In his view, she cannot pursue both the PhD and the elite level training she engaged in before the car accident. He considers it possible that once she completes her PhD and is no longer required to spend so many hours on the computer, she could return to unlimited sport, but he also said that with the loss of at least four years while she completes her PhD, it is unlikely that she will return to her status as a professional triathlete.
93  In addition to physiotherapy, massage therapy, chiropractic care, and analgesic medication, Dr. Lloyd-Smith recommended Ms. Kirkham continue with IMS treatments and trigger point injections. He did not provide a recommended timeframe for these treatments to continue because, in his view, the settling of myofascial pain syndrome is so variable. He also expressed the view that it is important for Ms. Kirkham to maintain her fitness, strength, flexibility, and balance through yoga and/or Pilates.
Dr. Jonathan Gerrard
94  Dr. Gerrard is a chiropractor with a special interest in the fields of repetitive strain injuries and soft tissue injuries. He also has expertise in biomechanics. Approximately 50% of his practice consists of treating elite athletes.
95  Dr. Gerrard started treating Ms. Kirkham before the car accident for performance care and continued after for injury rehabilitation. He examined her on January 6, 2011, the day after the accident, and found a significant alteration in Ms. Kirkham's tissue texture within the cervicothoracic paraspinal muscles with evident muscle spasm, taut bands, and spinal stiffness. He continued treating her regularly until June 2013.
96  It is Dr. Gerrard's opinion that Ms. Kirkham sustained a chronic type III (front impact), grade III (moderate severity) whiplash injury to the cervicothoracic spine and in particular to her cervical thoracic facet joints in the car accident. He testified that women with long slender necks are predisposed to more significant whiplash injury.
97  Dr. Gerrard used two indices to monitor Ms. Kirkham's progress between January 2011 and March 2013. The Neck Disability Index shows marked improvement in Ms. Kirkham's neck disability between January and March 2011, from 50% disability to about 12%, followed by a series of more moderate peaks and valleys. Since August 2012, Ms. Kirkham's neck disability scores have remained fairly constant at about 10%. The Oswestry Index shows more gradual but also variable improvement, starting at about 15% disability in January 2011, decreasing (though not steadily) to zero disability in August 2011, and remaining at about 4% from February 2012 to March 2013.
98  Dr. Gerrard also monitored Ms. Kirkham's progress over time by measuring her cervical range of motion. As already noted, by January 2012, the range of motion had recovered in five of the six directions. The sixth, cervical extension, was close to normal in August 2012, but returned to a slightly negative variance in April 2013.
99  In Dr. Gerrard's opinion, the bike crash did not result in any significant change to Ms. Kirkham's car accident related symptoms. He based this opinion on his examination of Ms. Kirkham after the crash and the fact that his findings remained unchanged.
100  In cross-examination, Dr. Gerrard expressed the opinion that Ms. Kirkham slid off her bike when she crashed, though he acknowledged that he does not actually know how she fell. This opinion was based on the speed at which Ms. Kirkham was traveling just prior to the crash (approximately 40 km/h), the fact that she was going around a left turn, and that she suffered abrasions on the left side of her body. He said that during a slide there is more time to decelerate and the mechanism of injury would be different than it was in the car accident. As with Dr. Finlayson's evidence, I did not take Dr. Gerrard to be saying that it is impossible to suffer a soft tissue neck injury in a bike fall. I took him to be saying that because of the different mechanisms of injury involved in the two kinds of impact, it would be wrong to infer a soft tissue neck injury solely from the fact that Ms. Kirkham fell off a bike and suffered a concussion.
101  In Dr. Gerrard's opinion, Ms. Kirkham has a poor prognosis for full recovery. In his view, she will have ongoing chronic intermittent upper back pain with neck stiffness, especially if participating in a rigorous training regime.
102  Dr. Gerrard recommended ongoing multidisciplinary care including physiotherapy twice a month, massage therapy every two to three weeks, and continued trigger point injections. He also recommended she resume monthly chiropractic care once the physiotherapy goals have been achieved. In his view, passive treatments such as massage and chiropractic care are required because the muscles that move the facet joints are small and not voluntarily controlled.
103  The defendant submitted that Dr. Gerrard was biased in favour of Ms. Kirkham and "injected advocacy" in his reports. For example, defence counsel suggested that in both the Austrian bike crash and a previous one, Ms. Kirkham fell from her bike on the left side and hit her head, and that Dr. Gerrard "refused to acknowledge even these common elements". This mischaracterizes Dr. Gerrard's evidence. He did acknowledge these common elements. He did not acknowledge that both bike crashes would necessarily involve the same mechanism of injury because, as he explained, he knew Ms. Kirkham was going around a bend in the Austrian crash and the speed at which she was traveling, while he did not know similar details about the other crash.
104  Dr. Gerrard knew Ms. Kirkham well, having treated her on a regular basis since 2009. He was well positioned to testify about her condition after the car accident, the progress in her condition up to May 2011, her condition after the bike crash, and her progression since then. I found him to be a careful and precise witness and do not consider any of the criticisms levelled by counsel for the defendant to undermine his credibility or the weight to be given to his evidence.
Ms. Marilou Lamy
105  Ms. Lamy is a registered physiotherapist with 20 years' experience in private practice. She has a Bachelor's degree in physiotherapy, a graduate diploma in manual therapy, and a diploma in sport physiotherapy. She has worked with the Canadian National Track and Field Team, including at many major events such as the Olympics, the World Championships, the Commonwealth Games, and the Pan-American Games.
106  Ms. Lamy's treatments, beginning in April 2011, have focused on regaining mobility and control in Ms. Kirkham's neck, upper back, and hip. She has employed various types of manual therapy techniques, myofascial release, deep tissue release, IMS, and postural awareness exercises.
107  It is Ms. Lamy's opinion that Ms. Kirkham's improvement has been significant but is not complete. In her view, Ms. Kirkham has returned to a functional level with respect to the activities of daily living and to a normal level of work in her PhD studies, but is not able to resume her pre-accident training load. In her view, it is possible that Ms. Kirkham will continue to gain mobility, strength, and flexibility.
108  In Ms. Lamy's opinion, Ms. Kirkham requires ongoing physiotherapy treatment twice monthly, gradually decreasing to once per month. She testified that while she initially planned to help Ms. Kirkham develop some "self-management strategies" she has come to the view, over time, that Ms. Kirkham requires one-on-one supervision.
109  Counsel for the defendant submitted that Ms. Lamy's evidence ought to be given little weight because, among other things, she made changes to her report that, in the defendant's view, were intended to downplay the role of Ms. Kirkham's concussion in her progress or to downplay her progress overall. For example, in an earlier version of her report, Ms. Lamy stated that Ms. Kirkham "had difficulty progressing after that bike crash and struggled to manage work and training due to the head injury". Ms. Lamy deleted the words "due to the head injury" in her subsequent report. She explained she had done so because she did not consider herself qualified to express an opinion regarding the reason for Ms. Kirkham's struggle to manage her work and training.
110  The earlier version of Ms. Lamy's report contained the sentence "By December 2011, she had returned to a decent level of training" and, later, "She had pneumonia in December and it set her back as she was not able to return to any type of sport and activities until mid-January 2012". The final version of the report does not include those sentences. Instead, it says: "She continued during that time to increase her training load and it was going well until November 2011 when she had pneumonia."
111  In my view, the differences in the two versions of Ms. Lamy's report are not material. Further, I accept her explanation that no one influenced her to make the changes and that the changes were prompted by her concern to not overstate and to restrict herself to expressing opinions only within her expertise. I do not consider any of the matters identified by counsel for the defendant with regard to Ms. Lamy's evidence or her report to undermine her credibility or the weight to be given to the opinions she expressed.
Mr. Sean Campbell
112  Mr. Campbell is a registered physiotherapist. He has a Master's Degree in physiotherapy and exercise science. Ms. Kirkham has been seeing Mr. Campbell at least once a month and sometimes two or three times a month since the fall of 2012.
113  It is Mr. Campbell's opinion that Ms. Kirkham has developed compensatory strategies in the way she uses her muscles to support herself when engaged in various activities and that these compensatory strategies exacerbate her symptoms. For example, he explained that when sitting and cycling, she engages her neck and shoulder muscles to support her position which results in cervical and upper thoracic compression. He has employed treatments such as manual therapy, IMS, exercise, and taping in an effort to restore normal patterns and increase kinesthetic awareness.
114  In Mr. Campbell's opinion, given Ms. Kirkham's progress to date, the consistent exacerbating factors in her symptomology and the physical requirements of her training regime, it is unlikely that she will return to competitive triathlon.
115  In Mr. Campbell's view, Ms. Kirkham requires ongoing treatment, similar to what she is currently receiving, at least for the duration of her PhD and postdoctoral studies.
Dr. Marc Boyle
116  Dr. Boyle is an orthopedic surgeon who practiced as such for 30 years. He is now retired from active practice and his work is restricted to conducting independent medical examinations at the request of ICBC.
117  Dr. Boyle saw Ms. Kirkham for an independent medical examination on December 17, 2013. He interviewed Ms. Kirkham and conducted a physical examination. On palpation, he noted tenderness over the left trapezius and rhomboid and normal muscle tone. He also noted tenderness in the hip area and the gluteus maximus muscle. Among other things, he reviewed clinical records of Dr. Gerrard, Ms. Lamy, and Dr. Lloyd-Smith, records from the Austrian hospital where Ms. Kirkham was treated after the bike crash, the medical/legal reports of Dr. Gerrard, Dr. Lloyd-Smith, Dr. Finlayson, and Ms. Lamy's original report.
118  It is Dr. Boyle's opinion that as a result of the accident, Ms. Kirkham suffered a myofascial strain to her cervical spine and she may have sustained a soft tissue strain to her lumbar spine. In his opinion, Ms. Kirkham exacerbated these injuries when she fell off her bike in Austria. In his view, had it not been for that bike crash, Ms. Kirkham's car accident related symptoms would have resolved within six to nine months following the car accident, and, had they persisted beyond that, would not have been disabling.
119  Dr. Boyle disagreed with Dr. Finlayson's opinion that Ms. Kirkham suffers from cervical facet arthropathy. His report noted that there was no radiological evidence that Ms. Kirkham suffered from such a condition. In cross-examination, he equated cervical facet arthropathy with arthritis of the facet joints and he said that the condition occurs when the discs between the vertebrae dry out, which narrows the joint space and leads to the formation of bone spurs. He said there was no radiological evidence to support a finding that Ms. Kirkham has any joint space narrowing or bone spur formation. As already discussed, Dr. Finlayson explained that cervical facet arthropathy is distinct from arthritis and involves inflammation not visible on an x-ray.
120  While Dr. Boyle did not appear to disagree with Dr. Finlayson's diagnoses of myofascial pain syndrome, left hip girdle pain, and chronic pain syndrome, he disagreed that the car accident was the primary contributor to these conditions. He said that Ms. Kirkham's symptoms became inhibiting following the bike crash and any continuing symptoms are, in his view, attributable to the bike crash and not the car accident.
121  In terms of future care, it was Dr. Boyle's opinion that Ms. Kirkham should involve herself in a self-physiotherapy program. In other words, she should carry out exercises on her own. In his opinion, she does not require formal physiotherapy, chiropractic care, massage therapy, acupuncture, a sports psychologist, occupational therapist or any other therapy. In cross-examination, he expressed the view that chiropractic treatments, trigger point injections, acupuncture, and massage therapy are not "curative" and are therefore of no long-term benefit. However, he acknowledged that such treatments would make Ms. Kirkham feel better in the short term.
122  Dr. Boyle's opinions that Ms. Kirkham exacerbated her car accident related injuries in the bike crash and that her continuing symptoms are attributable to the bike crash and not the car accident, were based on the following:
in his opinion, when a person suffers the kinds of injuries Ms. Kirkham suffered in the bike crash (concussion and abrasions on the face, neck, and shoulder) he or she will also suffer flexion or extension of the cervical spine;
the Austrian hospital took x-rays of Ms. Kirkham's neck; and
Ms. Kirkham had been on an upward curve of improvement prior to the bike crash, though not completely asymptomatic, and the resolution of her car accident symptoms was "near complete"; thus, the only explanation for the change in her condition after the crash is that she must have reinjured her neck.
123  In my view, these opinions ought to be given little weight because they either do not follow from the premises upon which they are based or the premises themselves are flawed.
124  Dr. Boyle assumed that because Ms. Kirkham suffered a concussion and abrasions in the fall, she must have injured her neck. However, he ignored Ms. Kirkham's actual symptoms following the bike crash. He reviewed the clinical records and reports of Ms. Kirkham's treating practitioners but neglected to consider the lack of any significant change to Ms. Kirkham's condition, as noted by them. He acknowledged in cross-examination that the Austrian hospital records state there was no indication of pain in the area of the cervical spine following the crash and that the cervical spine moved freely. He did not attempt to explain how, in the face of the findings of Ms. Kirkham's treating practitioners, the Austrian records, and Ms. Kirkham's subjective report that her neck symptoms were not worsened after the crash, he could nevertheless conclude that Ms. Kirkham injured her neck in the crash.
125  It does not follow that because the Austrian hospital took x-rays of Ms. Kirkham's neck, it is likely she suffered a neck injury. It goes without saying that x-rays are a diagnostic tool used to determine whether someone has suffered an injury. The mere fact x-rays were taken does not indicate an injury did indeed occur. It is perplexing that Dr. Boyle relied on the fact x-rays were taken at the Austrian hospital, but not on the hospital records indicating there was no neck pain and the cervical spine moved freely.
126  Dr. Boyle's comments that the resolution of Ms. Kirkham's symptoms was "near complete" prior to the bike crash and that she experienced a significant change in her condition afterward are inconsistent with the clinical records and reports of the treating practitioners. Dr. Boyle appears to have relied on statistics showing that the majority of patients who develop symptoms following a whiplash will make a full recovery, rather than on Ms. Kirkham's actual situation. While Ms. Kirkham's condition certainly improved between January and May 2011, it cannot be said that her symptoms were nearly resolved before the crash. Further, it cannot be said that there was a significant change to her neck and upper back symptoms following the bike crash. In cross-examination, Dr. Boyle agreed that Ms. Kirkham's treating practitioners would be in a better position to state whether there were changes to her condition as a result of the crash. As already noted, he had access to their records and reports and yet did not refer to them in explaining the basis for his opinions.
127  Dr. Boyle claimed that his assumption about Ms. Kirkham's condition before the bike crash was based on the history as relayed to him by her. Defence counsel submits that Dr. Boyle was entitled to rely on that history and cannot be blamed if that history is inconsistent with the clinical records. However, Dr. Boyle acknowledged that he did not ask Ms. Kirkham very much about the progression of her symptoms. He appeared to assume that Ms. Kirkham's recovery was near complete from what he was told about her attempts to return to training and competition between January and May 2011, instead of considering the evidence of her actual progression of symptoms over time.
128  Dr. Boyle's failure to consider Ms. Kirkham's symptoms before and after the bike crash, as noted by her treating practitioners, particularly given his admission that those practitioners would be in a better position to state whether there were changes in her condition following the bike crash, is, in my view, so fundamental that it calls into question the reliability of Dr. Boyle's evidence generally. For these reasons, where there are conflicts in the expert evidence, I prefer the evidence of Dr. Finlayson, Dr. Lloyd-Smith, and Dr. Gerrard over the evidence of Dr. Boyle.
MS. KIRKHAM'S CREDIBILITY
129  The defendant submits that Ms. Kirkham has overstated her symptoms, particularly in the time period leading up to the bike crash, and that her evidence that she had no change to her neck pain pattern or intensity following the bike crash and that her concussion did not contribute to her decision to take the leave of absence should not be believed.
130  The factors to be considered when assessing credibility were summarized in Bradshaw v. Stenner, , at para.186, aff'd . They include the firmness of the witness's memory, the ability of the witness to resist the influence of interest in modifying her recollection, whether the witness's evidence harmonizes with independent evidence that has been accepted, whether the witness changes her evidence during direct examination and cross-examination (or between examination for discovery and trial) or is otherwise inconsistent in her recollections, whether the witness's evidence seems generally unreasonable, impossible, or unlikely, and the witness's demeanor. Fundamentally, the question is whether the witness's evidence is consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole.
131  As Ms. Kirkham's case involves subjective complaints of pain, it is particularly important to exercise caution and examine her evidence carefully: Price v. Kostryba  (S.C.). If her account is not convincing, then the hypothesis upon which her medical evidence rests will be undermined: Samuel v. Chrysler Credit Canada Ltd., , at paras. 15, 43-44. Having said that, this is not a case that is entirely dependent on subjective complaints. Dr. Lloyd-Smith, Dr. Gerrard, and Dr. Finlayson all found objective symptoms including muscle spasm and taut bands.
132  The defendant submits that Ms. Kirkham's evidence of the progression of her symptoms, particularly just prior to the Austrian race, is inconsistent with her evidence about her ability to train in the weeks prior to that race and her decision to return to competition at that time. The defendant submits this is similar to the claim in Sandhar v. Rolston, , where the plaintiff continued to suffer from shoulder pain and yet decided to undertake three days of snow shoveling. In Sandhar, Mr. Justice Affleck found it impossible to reconcile a decision to shovel snow over three days for several hours each day with the presence of significant shoulder pain.
133  In my view, the decisions Ms. Kirkham made with respect to the resumption of her training and attempts at competition bear no similarity to the plaintiff's decision in Sandhar to shovel snow. The evidence clearly established that Ms. Kirkham is extremely focused, goal-oriented, determined, and competitive. Triathlon was her passion. She changed the way she trained in order to minimize the pain (such as cycling indoors initially, changing her bike setup, modifying her swimming by not doing flip turns, etc.). She was optimistic that she would get better. She had always recovered from injuries before and assumed she would recover again. She was determined to minimize her deconditioning so that when the pain resolved she would be ready to go. She was prepared to train through pain, and she did so. She cannot be faulted for having taken this approach. The defence submission in this regard places her in an obvious "catch 22". In trying valiantly to return to her pre-accident lifestyle, she is said to have been exaggerating the effects of her injuries; however, if she failed to try to return to her pre-accident lifestyle, she likely would have been criticized for the same.
134  The defendant submits that Ms. Kirkham was impeached on some key points in her evidence. At most, the defendant has identified some minor differences in what Ms. Kirkham said about her condition at various times and in very different circumstances. Some of the alleged inconsistencies arise from statements made by Ms. Kirkham on her website and Twitter feed. In Diack v. Bardsley  (S.C.), at para. 30, aff'd  (C.A.), McEachern C.J.S.C. said the "usefulness [of minor variations between a witness's evidence at trial and on discovery] is limited because witnesses seldom speak with much precision at discovery ...". The same can be said, but with more force, about the precision and fullness with which people speak on social media, particularly on Twitter where messages may not exceed 140 characters in length. Ms. Kirkham explained that she often tweeted positive messages as this was one way of trying to keep up good relations with her sponsors. Also, the fact that she did so is consistent with Ms. Kirkham's natural tendencies. She is a positive individual who was determined to recover from her injuries, and in these circumstances it is not at all surprising that she would have taken to social media to report, with enthusiasm, a particularly good day.
135  The defendant says that Ms. Kirkham claimed, in her evidence in chief, to have been in constant pain from January to March 2011, getting only some relief from her treatments, but that her own symptom diary establishes that she had some pain-free days. First, many of Ms. Kirkham's witnesses, particularly Mr. Stephens, Dr. Gerrard, and Mr. Carlsson, corroborated her evidence of significant disability during the first three or so months following the car accident. Further, when her symptom diary is reviewed as a whole, it supports the plaintiff's evidence. While she did have some good days, they were often followed by particularly bad days. In my view, the symptom diary corroborates Ms. Kirkham's evidence of her determination to persevere in the face of significant pain.
136  The defendant also criticizes Ms. Kirkham for having written on her website that she did not participate in triathlons in June and July 2011 due to both her concussion and her neck injury, and yet on Twitter and in her evidence at trial she testified that she could not train or race following the bike crash due to her concussion. However, when Ms. Kirkham's evidence is considered as a whole, there is no inconsistency. At trial, she acknowledged that she could not train following the bike crash because of her concussion symptoms, but she also said that her neck symptoms continued to hinder her ability to train and race.
137  The defendant submits that Ms. Kirkham was impeached when she testified at trial that a sprint triathlon she did in the summer of 2012 was difficult and not enjoyable, yet she tweeted on June 11, 2012, that she "Love[d] being on the bike again". Ms. Kirkham's evidence at trial was that in July 2012 she competed in this sprint triathlon, which is about one-quarter of the distance of a half-Ironman race. She said she had some good training sessions in June and on that basis decided to try this race in July. She said the race was not enjoyable. Her pace times for all three segments were similar to what she had achieved in 2010 competing in half-Ironman races. As she put it, she was doing "one-quarter of the distance but at the same speed, which was pretty humbling". She also said she had neck pain during the race. The tweet which is said to be inconsistent with this evidence is dated June 11, 2012, some weeks before the sprint triathlon, and reads:
After all the drama, ended up being a good workout! 3 hrs with 4X15 min tempo with ascending avg. W. Love being on the bike again!
138  The tweet, on its face, does not refer to a race but rather a bike workout. It appears to indicate she had a good day of training on June 11, 2012. It is entirely consistent with her evidence at trial that she had some good training sessions in June. It is not at all inconsistent with her evidence of pain during a race several weeks later, her performance at which provided her with disappointing evidence of her lack of progress.
139  Ms. Kirkham's evidence about her pre-accident lifestyle, the impact of the car accident on that lifestyle, and her efforts to return to her pre-accident condition was corroborated by several other witnesses, including her treating practitioners, Mr. Stephens, Mr. Carlsson, Dr. Campbell, Ms. Schneeberg, Mr. Johnson, and Ms. Wilkie. The defence submitted that the evidence of Mr. Stephens, Mr. Carlsson, Dr. Campbell, Ms. Schneeberg, Mr. Johnson, and Ms. Wilkie ought to be given little weight because they are all affected by natural human bias owing to their familiarity with and varying degrees of affection for Ms. Kirkham. However, this too places Ms. Kirkham in a "catch 22" position. The people in a position to comment on the impact of the accident on Ms. Kirkham's life are the people she shares her life with. Had she not called any such people as witnesses, the court would likely have been asked to draw an adverse inference from her failure to do so. I was impressed by all of the witnesses called by Ms. Kirkham. They were all careful and precise in giving their evidence. None was shown to be inaccurate. I accept their evidence.
140  While Ms. Kirkham may not have remembered precisely how she was feeling each day over the last three and one-half years, this is to be expected particularly where, as here, she has not enjoyed steady improvement. Rather, as described by Mr. Carlsson, her progress is better characterized as one step forward, two steps back, two steps forward, one step back, or as described by Mr. Stephens as progressing in waves, or as described by Ms. Kirkham as a series of peaks and valleys. Ms. Kirkham's evidence was largely consistent with the statements she made on her Twitter account, blog, and website and the statements attributed to her in the clinical records of her treating practitioners. Her efforts to resume training and try to compete notwithstanding continuing pain are consistent with her incredibly driven personality. She was forthright and frankly described the efforts she made to return to her pre-accident lifestyle. Her evidence is consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole. In short, I found Ms. Kirkham to be a very credible witness and I accept her evidence.
ANALYSIS
Causation
141  Ms. Kirkham must establish on a balance of probabilities that the defendant's negligence was both a factual and legal cause of her injuries. In a case such as this, where there are multiple potential causes of injury, the court must also consider whether her injuries are divisible or indivisible.
142  The general test for causation in fact, established in Athey v. Leonati, , at paras. 13-17, is the "but for" test: "but for" the defendant's negligence, would the plaintiff's injuries have occurred? Cause in fact need not be determined by scientific precision and is best answered with ordinary common sense: Athey, at para. 16.
143  The plaintiff need not establish that the defendant's negligence was the sole cause of the injury. If other potential causes exist, such as the bike crash in this case, the plaintiff will still establish cause in fact if she can prove a substantial connection between the injury and the defendant's conduct, beyond the de minimus range: Farrant v. Laktin, , at para. 11.
144  The characterization of damage as divisible or indivisible is necessary to ensure that the defendant is not held liable for injuries not caused by his or her negligence: Athey, at paras. 24-25. If an injury is indivisible, subject to contributory negligence and subject to the plaintiff also establishing legal causation, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for all damages attributable to that injury regardless of the contribution of other causes: Athey, at paras. 17-20. Indivisible injuries are those that cannot be separated or have liability attributed to the constituent causes whereas divisible injuries are those capable of being separated out and having their damages assessed independently: Bradley v. Groves, , at para. 20. Whether damage is divisible or indivisible is a question of fact: B.P.B. v. M.M.B., , at para. 74.
145  In order to establish legal causation, the plaintiff must show that the type or kind of injury she suffered was reasonably foreseeable or, in other words, not too remote from the factual cause: T.W.N.A. v. Canada (Ministry of Indian Affairs), , at para. 17; Hussack v. Chilliwack School District No. 33, , at para 54.
146  The chain of causation will be "broken" where an intervening event, rather than the defendant's conduct, is considered the proximate or legal cause of the subsequent injury. This principle, known as novus actus interveniens, recognizes that defendants should not be held liable for objectively unforeseen consequences of their actions: Hussack, at para. 87; Yoshikawa v. Yu  (C.A.), at para. 21.
147  The question of whether an intervening event breaks the chain of causation is a question of fact: Hussack, at para. 88.
148  Where the intervening event consists of conduct of the plaintiff, the question of whether it breaks the chain of causation depends upon whether the plaintiff acted unreasonably. As stated by Madam Justice Bennett in Hussack, at para. 82:
In essence, the decisions say that if an injured party acts unreasonably and causes him or herself further injury, the tortfeasor is not responsible for injuries suffered as a result of the second injury.
Assessment of damages
149  Once causation in fact and law has been established, the analysis shifts to the rules of damages which determine the quantum of the defendant's liability. The fundamental principle in assessing tort damages is that the quantum should be that which is required to place the plaintiff in his or her original position, i.e. the position he or she would have been in absent the defendant's negligence: Athey, at para. 32. The defendant need not put the plaintiff in a better position than his or her original position and should not compensate the plaintiff for any damages he or she would have suffered anyway: Blackwater v. Plint, , at para. 78. The analysis requires a determination of the plaintiff's position after the negligence and an assessment of what the plaintiff's original position would have been, and it is the difference between these positions that represents the quantum of the defendant's liability: Athey, at para. 32.
150  In determining the plaintiff's original position, it may be necessary to consider any debilitating effects of a manifest pre-existing condition or to take into account a measurable risk that a pre-existing condition would have detrimentally affected the plaintiff in the future regardless of the defendant's negligence. This is the crumbling skull rule, and results in the damages award being reduced to reflect circumstances inherent in the plaintiff's pre-accident condition: Athey, at para. 35.
151  Unrelated intervening events may be taken into account in the same way as pre-existing conditions. If an intervening event would have affected the plaintiff's original position adversely irrespective of the defendant's negligence, it may be appropriate to reduce the quantum of the defendant's liability accordingly: Athey, at paras. 31-32; T.W.N.A., at para. 36.
Findings of fact regarding the plaintiff's injuries
152  Applying the principles summarized above, I must determine:
what injuries were suffered by Ms. Kirkham as a result of the car accident and whether any of them were also caused or exacerbated by the bike crash;
if any of the injuries were caused by both the car accident and the bike crash, whether the bike crash amounts to a novus actus interveniens, breaking the chain of causation; and,
whether the injuries suffered by Ms. Kirkham in the bike crash have affected her in any event such that her damage awards should be reduced.
What injuries were suffered by Ms. Kirkham as a result of the car accident? Were any also caused or exacerbated by the bike crash?
153  It is not disputed that Ms. Kirkham suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck, shoulders, and upper back as a result of the car accident.
154  Ms. Kirkham submits that she has also developed myofascial pain syndrome, cervical facet arthropathy, chronic pain syndrome, and left hip girdle pain. She submits that these conditions continue to affect her more than three years after the accident, have forced her to give up her career as a professional triathlete, and have delayed her PhD studies by a year.
155  The defendant submits that while the soft tissue injuries initially affected Ms. Kirkham's studies and her training and competition as a triathlete, her symptoms and function improved over the four and one-half months between the car accident and the bike crash. The defendant also submits that had it not been for the bike crash, her symptoms would have resolved and her function would have returned within six to nine months following the car accident. The defendant does not appear to take serious issue with the diagnoses of myofascial pain syndrome, chronic pain syndrome, and left hip girdle pain, but, as already noted, submits that Ms. Kirkham's continuing symptoms are attributable to the bike crash. The defendant disputes the diagnosis of cervical facet arthropathy.
156  The medical evidence clearly supports a finding that Ms. Kirkham suffers from myofascial pain syndrome. Drs. Lloyd-Smith, Gerrard, and Boyle all agreed that she suffered soft tissue or myofascial strain to her neck and upper back areas. Dr. Finlayson and Dr. Lloyd-Smith are both of the view that she now suffers from myofascial pain syndrome as a result. Dr. Finlayson is also of the view that she suffers from chronic pain syndrome as a result. There is no contrary evidence. I accept the evidence of Dr. Lloyd-Smith and Dr. Finlayson, and find that Ms. Kirkham developed and continues to suffer from myofascial pain syndrome and chronic pain syndrome.
157  Dr. Finlayson is also of the view that Ms. Kirkham suffers from cervical facet arthropathy. Dr. Boyle disagreed with this diagnosis. As already discussed, Dr. Boyle and Dr. Finlayson appeared to be using the same term, cervical facet arthropathy, to refer to different conditions. Little turns on the name given to Ms. Kirkham's condition as the effect on her is the same. I find that she developed and continues to suffer from what Dr. Finlayson described as cervical facet arthropathy.
158  Dr. Finlayson is also of the view that Ms. Kirkham suffers from left hip girdle pain. While Dr. Boyle said the "etiology of her [hip] complaints is unclear", he did not express the view that Ms. Kirkham does not have hip pain. He disagreed with Dr. Finlayson's opinion that the hip pain was a consequence of deconditioning due to Ms. Kirkham's reduced activity level following the car accident. I will address the cause of the deconditioning later in these reasons. For now, on the basis of Ms. Kirkham's and Dr. Finlayson's evidence, I find that Ms. Kirkham is suffering from left hip girdle pain, and, on the basis of Dr. Finlayson's evidence, that it is caused by deconditioning.
159  The next question is whether Ms. Kirkham's myofascial pain syndrome, chronic pain syndrome, cervical facet arthropathy, and left hip girdle pain were caused by the car accident, the bike crash, or both.
160  As already stated, the defendant submits that but for the bike crash, Ms. Kirkham's symptoms would have resolved within six to nine months following the car accident and any continuing symptoms and disability she suffers are attributable solely to the bike crash. The defence theory is based on Dr. Boyle's opinion that Ms. Kirkham was on a path of recovery by mid May 2011, her recovery was "near complete" by then, and her condition significantly worsened after the bike crash.
161  In my view, it is clear from the evidence that Ms. Kirkham's recovery was not "near complete" by May 2011, and she was not on a continuing path of recovery at the time of the bike crash.
162  First, as already noted, Dr. Finlayson, Dr. Gerrard and Dr. Lloyd-Smith have contrary opinions and, for the reasons discussed, I prefer their evidence over that of Dr. Boyle.
163  Second, Ms. Kirkham's evidence, as well as the evidence of Dr. Gerrard and Mr. Carlsson, establishes that while Ms. Kirkham's condition did improve in the first three months following the accident, it then plateaued, with continuing peaks and valleys. The results of the Neck Disability and Oswestry indices administered by Dr. Gerrard show a marked improvement, particularly in her neck disability, between January and March 2011, but followed by a plateau with more moderate peaks and valleys. When Ms. Kirkham saw Ms. Lamy for the first time in late April 2011 she considered herself 50% improved. She went from no training immediately following the accident to as much as 18 hours per week by early May 2011. However, her training was still nowhere near where she had been before the accident in terms of intensity, consistency, and technique.
164  Third, Ms. Kirkham's evidence, as well as the evidence of Ms. Lamy, Dr. Lloyd-Smith, and Dr. Gerrard, establishes that Ms. Kirkham was continuing to suffer from significant symptoms at the time of the bike crash. On April 26, 2011, Ms. Lamy noted upper facet joint dysfunction of the upper cervical region as well as the mid/lower cervical area with right shoulder and arm discomfort and some neural tension. On May 5, 2011, Dr. Lloyd-Smith diagnosed myofascial pain syndrome and on May 6, 2011, he administered trigger point analgesic injections which provided some relief. On May 6, 2011, Dr. Gerrard was continuing to note palpatory tenderness in her cervical and thoracic spine. Ms. Kirkham testified that she was treated by a physiotherapist in Spain before the Spanish race and her neck was taped before both the Spanish and the Austrian races. She also testified that her neck pain was very bad during the last hour of the cycling portion of the Spanish race and that her neck was hurting right from the beginning of the cycling portion of the Austrian race. I accept all this evidence.
165  The next question is whether the bike crash exacerbated the effects of the injuries suffered in the car accident.
166  The defendant submits that from the speed Ms. Kirkham was traveling and the fact that she did not have more serious injuries to her body, it is reasonable to infer that her helmet (and by extension, her head) absorbed much of the impact of the fall. The defendant submits that because Ms. Kirkham had road rash, her body must have contorted as she felt. From this, the defendant advances the theory that the blow to Ms. Kirkham's head and the contortion of her body would have involved a rapid movement of her head and neck either backwards and forwards and/or from side to side and this would have caused soft tissue type strain to her neck, exacerbating her car accident related injuries. The defendant acknowledges that Ms. Kirkham's evidence at trial was that she had no change to her neck pain pattern or intensity as a result of the crash but suggested I should reject this evidence as defying logic.
167  I do not accept the defence theory. First, it rests upon the assumption that the fall would have resulted in neck movement consistent with the mechanism of injury for whiplash, but that is entirely speculative because no one knows how Ms. Kirkham fell. Although neck pain often co-exists with concussion, it was clear from Dr. Gerrard's evidence and Dr. Finlayson's evidence that this is not invariably so. Second, I accept Ms. Kirkham's evidence that she had no change to her neck pain pattern or intensity following the bike crash. It is consistent with what she said at the time (as reflected in the Austrian hospital records and the clinical records of her treating practitioners). It is also consistent with her objective symptoms following the crash as noted by Dr. Lloyd-Smith and Dr. Gerrard.
168  The defendant submits that Ms. Kirkham's evidence on this point is inconsistent with Jill Olson's evidence. Ms. Olson performed an ergonomic assessment of Ms. Kirkham's workstation at UBC in August 2011. The defendant's written submission states that Ms. Olson testified that, during that meeting, Ms. Kirkham told her that she experienced an exacerbation of her car accident related injuries as part of her concussion. In my view, this overstates Ms. Olson's evidence. When asked what, if anything, Ms. Kirkham told her about the injuries she had suffered in the bike crash, Ms. Olson said she did not have anything in her notes in quotation marks and so she does not know if Ms. Kirkham said anything specific. Ms. Olson said she "would have taken some notes suggesting that she sustained a concussion and her symptoms had been exacerbated", but she acknowledged that she spent very little time discussing the bike crash with Ms. Kirkham, as her focus was on Ms. Kirkham's current needs. Ms. Kirkham testified that her concussion symptoms exacerbated the problems she was having with her computer work for a time. She also testified that she had to significantly decrease her training again as a result of her concussion symptoms. Any or all of that could have caused Ms. Olson to note that "her symptoms have been exacerbated". Given the very short time they discussed the matter, the fact that Ms. Olson made a point of saying that she does not know if Ms. Kirkham said anything specific, and the vagueness of her note about the symptoms having been exacerbated, I do not consider Ms. Olson's evidence to conflict with Ms. Kirkham's.
169  Finally, given the expert evidence that I have accepted, a finding that Ms. Kirkham did not significantly aggravate her neck injury in the bike crash cannot be said to defy logic. Dr. Lloyd-Smith, Dr. Gerrard, and Dr. Finlayson all expressed the view that the bike crash did not significantly contribute to Ms. Kirkham's ongoing neck, upper back, and shoulder pain. Dr. Boyle disagreed with that view, but for the reasons already expressed, I prefer the evidence of Dr. Lloyd-Smith, Dr. Gerrard, and Dr. Finlayson over the evidence of Dr. Boyle.
170  I do not accept the submission that, but for the bike crash in Austria, Ms. Kirkham would have made a full recovery from the injuries she suffered in the car accident within six to nine months. It is clear from the above summary that this theory is not in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence, which establishes that Ms. Kirkham continued to suffer the debilitating impacts of the car accident before, at the time of, and after the Austrian bike crash.
171  For the above reasons, I find that the bike crash did not exacerbate Ms. Kirkham's neck and upper back injuries and did not contribute to her myofascial pain syndrome, chronic pain syndrome, or cervical facet arthropathy. I find that Ms. Kirkham's myofascial pain syndrome, chronic pain syndrome and cervical facet arthropathy were caused by the car accident.
172  I have found that Ms. Kirkham's left hip girdle pain, which only became a material issue for her in the fall of 2012, was caused by deconditioning. The evidence clearly established that Ms. Kirkham suffered a concussion in the bike crash and that she significantly reduced her training for at least three months following the bike crash. Given the reduction in her training over the summer of 2011 due to the concussion, the only reasonable inference is that the concussion contributed to the deconditioning. For these reasons I find that the left hip girdle pain is an indivisible injury caused by both the car accident and the bike crash.
Did the bike crash break the chain of causation?
173  Counsel for the defendant submits that Ms. Kirkham claims the bike crash in Austria would not have occurred but for the injuries she suffered in the car accident. Counsel for the defendant then responds that the bike crash was a non-tortious intervening event sufficient to break the causal chain between the car accident and Ms. Kirkham's subsequent claimed damage.
174  In my view, this submission mischaracterizes Ms. Kirkham's position with respect to the bike crash. She is not asserting that the defendant is liable for the injuries she suffered in the bike crash, such as the concussion and abrasions. Further, and in any event, it cannot be said that Ms. Kirkham acted unreasonably in participating in the Austrian race. Her decision to do so was supported by her treating practitioners and her coach. None of the practitioners who testified indicated they had any concerns regarding her safety in attempting the race. For these reasons, the defence of novus actus interveniens does not apply.
Did the injuries suffered by Ms. Kirkham in the bike crash affect her in any event such that her damage awards should be reduced?
175  For the reasons already set out, I have found that the bike crash did not exacerbate Ms. Kirkham's injuries. However, the concussion she suffered in the bike crash did contribute to the deconditioning that in turn led to the left hip girdle pain.
176  The defendant submitted that Ms. Kirkham's concussion also contributed to her decision to take a leave of absence from her PhD studies, and this should be reflected in any award for loss of income earning capacity.
177  Ms. Kirkham testified that in the summer of 2011 she was not concerned about the concussion because the symptoms were resolving as expected. Rather, she was distressed by the fact that she was continuing to experience neck pain, and this interfered with her ability to work on the computer. The decision to take the leave of absence was not made until October 2011 and, by that time, according to Ms. Kirkham, her concussion symptoms had resolved. The stress that Ms. Kirkham was feeling in September and October 2011, related in part to the time she was spending attending the many rehabilitation sessions for her soft tissue injuries.
178  Dr. Lloyd-Smith testified that the concussion was not an issue in October 2011 when Ms. Kirkham decided to take the leave. He recommended the leave because he thought Ms. Kirkham needed to minimize her stress and reduce her computer use which was interfering with the rehabilitation of her neck injury.
179  In my view, there is no real and substantial possibility that Ms. Kirkham would have taken a leave of absence in any event as a result of the concussion. Based on the totality of the evidence, I find on the balance of probabilities that the concussion did not contribute to Ms. Kirkham's leave of absence from her PhD studies.
180  The defendant submitted that Ms. Kirkham's concussion also contributed to her decision to cancel triathlons in the summer and fall of 2011, and this should be reflected in any award for loss of income earning capacity. Ms. Kirkham acknowledged that as a result of the concussion symptoms over the summer of 2011, not only was she unable to compete in triathlons, she was not even able to train. She also acknowledged that this hiatus from her training, together with the pain she felt during the cycling portion of the Austrian race, forced her to accept that she was not going to qualify for the 2011 World Championship and so she decided there was no point in continuing to push through the pain. In other words, she concluded that she had lost the 2011 season and so eased back into training more gradually than she otherwise would have done. The only reasonable inference from this evidence is that the concussion caused Ms. Kirkham to cancel the races over the summer of 2011 and contributed to her decision to cancel the race she had planned for the fall of 2011.
181  I will address the contribution of the concussion to Ms. Kirkham's left hip girdle pain and to her decision to stop competing over the balance of 2011 when I address the relevant heads of damage.
Summary
182  In summary, and having taken into account all the evidence, I make the following findings:
Ms. Kirkham suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck, shoulders and upper back as a result of the car accident.
Those injuries have resulted in myofascial pain syndrome, cervical facet arthropathy, and chronic pain syndrome, all of which continue to affect Ms. Kirkham.
Ms. Kirkham suffered a concussion and abrasions in the bike crash which are divisible injuries for which the defendant is not liable.
Ms. Kirkham did not exacerbate or aggravate her soft tissue injuries in the bike crash and the bike crash did not contribute to Ms. Kirkham's myofascial pain syndrome, cervical facet arthropathy, or chronic pain syndrome.
Ms. Kirkham's soft tissue injuries and the concussion she suffered in the bike crash both resulted in deconditioning that, in turn, caused Ms. Kirkham's left hip girdle pain, which is an indivisible injury.
Ms. Kirkham took a leave of absence that delayed the completion of her PhD studies by a year. The leave was required for Ms. Kirkham to focus on rehabilitation of the injuries caused by the car accident. The concussion did not contribute to Ms. Kirkham's leave of absence from her PhD studies.
As a result of the concussion, Ms. Kirkham did not compete in any triathlons during the summer of 2011. The concussion and the soft tissue injuries both contributed to her decision not to compete in any triathlons over the rest of 2011.
Damages
Non-pecuniary damages
183  Non-pecuniary damages are intended to compensate for pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of amenities. In Stapley v. Hejslet, , at para. 46, leave to appeal ref'd , the Court of Appeal set out a non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered by the court in assessing non-pecuniary damages including the age of the plaintiff, the nature of the injury, the severity and duration of pain, the extent of disability and impairment of physical and mental abilities, emotional suffering, impairment of family and other relationships, and loss of lifestyle.
184  The injuries Ms. Kirkham suffered in the car accident have had a very significant impact on all aspects of her life. Based on Ms. Kirkham's evidence and the evidence of her treating practitioners, I find that the pain in her neck and upper back areas was initially very intense, affecting her virtually every day, that it then improved by about 50% by late April 2011, and then plateaued with more modest peaks and valleys until the fall of 2012, when she gave up her high level training. While not pursuing her studies, Ms. Kirkham was able, particularly in 2012, to return to an intense level of training, but could not sustain it once she returned to school in the fall of 2012. The pain continues to be exacerbated by activities that require prolonged static postures, such as computer work and bike racing.
185  Since giving up her high level training in the fall of 2012, Ms. Kirkham's pain has become manageable as long as she restricts her computer work to a normal workweek. She suffers flare-ups of pain when she has to do more. She also continues to have pain if working away from her office workstation, engaging in lifting, and when running.
186  In addition to the pain, Ms. Kirkham was limited in her ability to perform household chores and grocery shopping and had to call upon Mr. Stephens for many of those tasks. She has been able to return to performing some of these daily activities, although any kind of lifting still causes her pain.
187  Ms. Kirkham's injuries have affected her personal relationships with her husband and her friends, as she can no longer engage in many of the physical activities they choose to engage in. Her social life is entirely different than it was before the accident.
188  The injuries also interfered with Ms. Kirkham's studies. She had to put her education on hold for a year. The work has been made more challenging due to the pain caused by the computer work. Her injuries led to her uncharacteristically poor performance during the second term of her PhD, which devastated her. Although she has managed to put her academic career back on track, she has done so at the cost of her high level athletics.
189  The biggest impact on Ms. Kirkham's life has been the loss of her ability to compete as an elite athlete. While many people might see an upside in the switch from intensely demanding, competitive physical activities like triathlon, running races, and time trials, to recreational and restorative activities like bike riding, yoga, and Pilates, that is not how Ms. Kirkham sees it. As she put it, neither she nor Mr. Stephens was interested in engaging in activities for fun. They both wanted to work at being the best at something. That dream has been taken from her. She has been devastated by and continues to struggle emotionally with the loss of her identity as an elite athlete.
190  Dr. Finlayson and Mr. Campbell both expressed the view that while there is potential for Ms. Kirkham to continue to improve and to engage in recreational sport with continued physiotherapy and other care, she will never return to competitive triathlon. Dr. Gerrard's prognosis is similar. In his view, Ms. Kirkham will sustain her current level of disability long-term. Dr. Lloyd-Smith is slightly more optimistic. In his view, it is possible, but unlikely given the delay, that Ms. Kirkham could return to elite level athletics once she completes her PhD. I accept all this evidence and find that Ms. Kirkham will continue to improve and will not be limited in her ability to participate in recreational sport, but she is very unlikely to return to elite training and competition.
191  Ms. Kirkham submits that an award of non-pecuniary damages of <damage type = "other">$140,000</damage> is appropriate. She cites the following cases in support:
Clark v. Kouba, , aff'd  (<damage type = "other">$85,000</damage>);
Isert v. Santos  (B.C.S.C.) (<damage type = "other">$60,000</damage>), rev'd  (<damage type = "other">$40,000</damage>);
Bonham v. Smith  (S.C.) (<damage type = "other">$130,000</damage>); and
Smith v. Fremlin,  (<damage type = "other">$90,000</damage>).
192  On the basis of Dr. Boyle's opinion that, but for the bike crash, Ms. Kirkham would have recovered within six to nine months following the car accident, the defendant submits that <damage type = "other">$20,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$30,000</damage> is an appropriate award for non-pecuniary damages. I have not accepted that opinion. In the alternative, the defendant submits that even if the bike crash is not found to have caused or contributed to the plaintiff's continuing symptoms, an appropriate award for non-pecuniary damages is in the range of <damage type = "other">$40,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$55,000</damage>. The defendant cites the following cases in support of that alternative submission:
Morrison v. Gauthier,  (<damage type = "other">$55,000</damage>);
Connolly v. Cowie,  (<damage type = "other">$50,000</damage>); and
Haughain v. Kaufman,  (<damage type = "other">$40,000</damage>).
193  Awards of non-pecuniary damages in other cases provide a useful guide but the specific circumstances of each individual plaintiff must be considered as any award of damages is to be based on the adverse impact of the particular injuries on the particular plaintiff. In my view, some of the authorities submitted by Ms. Kirkham, particularly Bonham, are a better guide when assessing Ms. Kirkham's non-pecuniary damages than those submitted by the defence. Although the plaintiffs in the cases relied upon by the defendant were all athletes, it does not appear that any were aspiring or likely to become professional athletes.
194  In Bonham, the plaintiff had been one of Australia's leading professional triathletes prior to the accident that gave rise to the case. Following the accident, she continued to experience success in triathlons, placing first at least four times in Australian national and international competitions. However, the injuries she suffered in the accident prevented her from being able to achieve the highest level of success in her sport. I acknowledge that Ms. Bonham was not an aspiring professional athlete at the time of her accident - she had already arrived. However, she continued to succeed in her sport even after her accident. While Ms. Kirkham was still aspiring, she was on the very verge of breaking through. Unlike Ms. Bonham, it appears likely that Ms. Kirkham's triathlon career is over.
195  Having regard to the case law cited and the Stapley factors, I assess Ms. Kirkham's non-pecuniary damages at <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$130,000</damage>, but reduced by <damage type = "reduction">$10,000</damage> to reflect the possibility that the deconditioning associated with the concussion would have caused her hip pain in any event.
Loss of income earning capacity
196  Both past and future income loss is properly considered on the basis of loss of earning capacity: Ibbitson v. Cooper, , at para. 19.
197  The burden of proof for actual past events is a balance of probabilities. However, an assessment of loss of both past and future earning capacity also involves consideration of hypothetical events. The plaintiff is not required to prove these hypothetical events on a balance of probabilities; rather, hypothetical events are given weight according to their relative likelihood. The future or hypothetical possibility will be taken into consideration as long as it is a real and substantial possibility and not mere speculation: Athey, at para. 27; Morlan v. Barrett, , at para. 38.
198  An award for loss of earning capacity, whether past or future, requires the assessment of damages which considers the overall fairness and reasonableness of the award taking into account all positive and negative contingencies, not a calculation according to a mathematical formula: Schenker v. Scott, , at para 53.
Loss of Past Earning Capacity
199  The value of a particular plaintiff's capacity to earn is equivalent to the value of the earnings that she or he would have, not could have, earned but for the injury that was sustained: Rowe v. Bobell Express Ltd., , at para. 30; M.B. v. British Columbia, , at para. 49.
200  Pursuant to s. 98 of the Insurance (Vehicle) Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 231, a plaintiff is entitled to recover only his or her past net income loss: Rizzolo v. Brett, , at para. 72, aff'd .
201  Ms. Kirkham claims that but for the injuries she sustained in the car accident, she would have earned income from three sources:
a grant funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ("CIHR");
income earned as a teaching assistant; and
potential prize money from triathlons.
202  Ms. Kirkham acknowledged that her CIHR grant was not lost. Rather it was simply paused during her leave of absence, and has now resumed. There is no real and substantial possibility that she will suffer pecuniary loss as a result.
203  Ms. Kirkham was forced to give up her work as a teaching assistant while on her leave of absence and, upon returning to school, she reduced the teaching that she would otherwise have engaged in. Her expert economics evidence established that up to the time of trial she suffered a net income loss of approximately <damage type = "other">$6,200</damage> due to the reduction in her teaching assistant work. I find that she would have earned that income but for the injuries she sustained in the car accident.
204  Ms. Kirkham seeks approximately <damage type = "other">$31,000</damage>, representing lost triathlon prize money for the period from the car accident to the trial.
205  Ms. Kirkham estimated the prize money she would have won in each of 2011, 2012, and 2013. For 2011, she listed each of the races that she had planned to compete in that year and then compared the actual results of those races with her assessment of how she would have performed on an average day assuming moderate improvement in her performance over the prior year. On this basis, she estimated forgone prize money for 2011 of <damage type = "other">$12,200</damage>. She estimated expenses of <damage type = "other">$4,166</damage> for entry fees and travel costs, for a net loss of prize income in 2011 of about <damage type = "other">$8,000</damage>.
206  Ms. Kirkham performed a similar analysis to estimate lost prize money for 2012 and 2013, but considered the races she would likely have competed in given her PhD commitments. She included fewer international races because of those commitments. She estimated net prize money of approximately <damage type = "other">$10,700</damage> in 2012 (<damage type = "other">$13,700</damage> gross prize money less entry fees and travel costs of just under <damage type = "other">$3,000</damage>) and <damage type = "other">$12,700</damage> in 2013 ($14,750 gross prize money less entry fees and travel costs of just over $2,000).
207  Ms. Kirkham earned <damage type = "other">$3,000</damage> in prize money from triathlon in 2010, but she acknowledged that her expenses exceeded <damage type = "other">$3,000</damage> that year. In her examination for discovery, she indicated that travel expenses alone would exceed <damage type = "other">$3,000</damage> a year. She also testified that fees for the Regional Triathlon Centre were <damage type = "other">$3,000</damage> per year, and she did not factor that amount into her analysis. When competing in 2010, she required performance care from Dr. Gerrard approximately three times per month. Based on her special damages claim, Dr. Gerrard charges $45 per session, so performance care would cost approximately <damage type = "other">$135</damage> per month, or <damage type = "other">$1,620</damage> per year.
208  For the reasons already discussed, I have found that Ms. Kirkham did not compete in any triathlons during the summer of 2011 as a result of the concussion, and the concussion and the soft tissue injuries both contributed to her decision not to compete in any triathlons over the balance of 2011. Her estimated gross prize winnings for 2011 included $3,400 for four races in the summer of 2011 and $2,000 for one race in October.
209  There is no doubt Ms. Kirkham won some prize money in 2010. Leaving aside the races in 2011 that she missed due in whole or in part to the concussion, it is clear she has not been able to race due to the car accident injuries. On the basis of those findings, she has established an impairment to her capacity to earn income from triathlon. However, the question remains as to whether she has established a real and substantial possibility that this diminished capacity has resulted in a pecuniary loss.
210  Considering Ms. Kirkham's performance in 2010, when she was relatively new to the sport, Mr. Carlsson's evidence as to her great potential, and Ms. Kirkham's evidence of her intentions regarding entering competitions, I find that there is a real and substantial possibility that Ms. Kirkham would have earned prize money of up to $12,000 a year in each of 2011, 2012 and 2013. However, in my view Ms. Kirkham has underestimated the expenses associated with competing internationally as a triathlete. I find it likely that the annual costs associated with competing in triathlon would include approximately $800 in entry fees, at least $3,000 in travel, $3,000 in fees for the Regional Triathlon Centre, and $1,620 for performance care from Dr. Gerrard. That does not include anything for clothing, shoes, and bikes, which, in my view, would likely have been offset by sponsors. On this basis, it is my view that Ms. Kirkham would have incurred costs of approximately <damage type = "sub-past wage loss">$8,500</damage> per year in order to compete in triathlon.
211  For the reasons set out above, Ms. Kirkham has established a real and substantial possibility that the diminishment in her capacity to earn income from triathlon has resulted in a pecuniary loss. However, once the impact of the concussion is reflected, I find that at best she would have broken even in 2011. I assess her diminished capacity to earn income from triathlon for 2012 and 2013 at $3,500 per year for a sum of <damage type = "sub-past wage loss">$7,000</damage>.
212  The total loss of past earning capacity for Ms. Kirkham is thus assessed as <damage type = "past wage loss">$13,200</damage>, comprising the loss of teaching income and prize money.
Loss of Future Earning Capacity
213  If the plaintiff has established both an impairment to her earning capacity and a real and substantial possibility that the impairment will result in a pecuniary loss, the loss may be quantified on either an earnings approach or a capital asset approach: Schenker, at para 51; Perren v. Lalari, , at para 25.
214  The earnings approach is generally appropriate where the loss is more easily measured such as where the plaintiff has some earnings history or where the court can otherwise reasonably estimate what his/her likely future earning capacity will be: Perren, at para 32; Clemas v. Gabrlik, , at para. 170. This approach typically involves an assessment of the plaintiff's estimated annual income loss multiplied by the remaining years of work and then discounted to reflect current value, or alternatively, awarding the plaintiff's entire annual income for a year or two: Pallos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia  (C.A.), at para. 43; Gilbert v. Bottle, , at para. 233; Clemas, at para. 170. While there is a more mathematical component to this approach, the assessment of damages is still a matter of judgment not mere calculation.
215  The capital asset approach, typically used in cases where the plaintiff has no clear earnings history, involves consideration of a number of factors such as whether the plaintiff has been rendered less capable overall of earning income from all types of employment, is less marketable or attractive as a potential employee, has lost the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities that might otherwise have been open, and is less valuable to herself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour market: Brown v. Golaiy  (S.C.), at para. 8.
216  Ms. Kirkham claims that her future earning capacity has been impaired in two respects. First, she claims that but for the car accident she would have completed her PhD a year earlier and, as a result, she has been delayed by a year in embarking upon her ultimate career as a university professor. Second, she claims that but for the accident she would have continued to compete and earn prize money from triathlon for at least another five years.
217  The first aspect of Ms. Kirkham's claim for future loss of income, that she was delayed in embarking upon her career as a university professor, is based on the theory that she will always be behind by a year as a result of the car accident. Her expert economics evidence calculates this loss to range between approximately <damage type = "other">$70,000</damage> (if based on average earnings for female professors at Canadian universities) and approximately <damage type = "other">$118,000</damage> (if based on earnings for male professors at the 75th percentile at American universities). Ms. Kirkham seeks <damage type = "other">$112,760.50</damage> as the average of the amount of earnings between male professors at the 75th percentile at Canadian universities and at American universities. It was not made clear why Ms. Kirkham considered it appropriate to base her claim on average male earnings at the 75th percentile, rather than average female earnings at the 75th percentile.
218  I find that Ms. Kirkham has established that her future earning capacity has been impaired by delay and that there is a real and substantial possibility that she will suffer a pecuniary loss as a result. However, for reasons similar to those expressed by Mr. Justice McEwan in Hillman v. Esaryk, , at paras. 23-25, I consider her suggested approach to assessing the value of that loss to be artificial and to inadequately reflect contingencies associated with her particularly driven and competitive personality.
219  The expert evidence Ms. Kirkham relies upon for quantifying this loss does not appear to reflect the fact that she intends to engage in at least two and perhaps more years of postdoctoral study before attempting to obtain a job as a professor. She testified that this would give her a better chance of securing a professorship but at the cost of a lower income over the next few years. Also, Ms. Kirkham demonstrated that she is an unusually ambitious and driven student. There is every likelihood that she will continue to apply that discipline to her studies and her profession. She has established that she has an extremely competitive nature and in my view will make every effort to catch up to her earnings potential. While she will be somewhat delayed in achieving her full income potential, I am satisfied that a few years down the road, the difference between graduating in 2014 and 2015 will be meaningless.
220  Although Ms. Kirkham has no earnings history, I do agree the earnings approach is more useful than the capital asset approach because Ms. Kirkham's future career plans are firm and, given the evidence as to her abilities and dedication, her career path is likely to unfold as planned. The expert economics evidence indicates that a starting salary for an assistant professor at a Canadian university is between approximately <damage type = "other">$67,000</damage> and <damage type = "other">$90,000</damage> per year. Given that this is not a matter of calculation, but rather of assessment, I consider that <damage type = "sub-future wage loss">$70,000</damage> will adequately compensate Ms. Kirkham for the one year delay in launching her career.
221  Based on the evidence of Ms. Kirkham and the evidence of Mr. Carlsson, I find that but for the car accident Ms. Kirkham would have continued to compete and earn prize money from triathlon for another five years. She has established a real and substantial possibility that the impairment to her earning capacity will result in a loss of such prize money. The expert economics evidence she tendered estimated her future loss at $10,491 per year, which is the average of Ms. Kirkham's own estimate of prize money and expenses during the three years from 2011 to 2013. For the reasons explained above in the section addressing Ms. Kirkham's claim for loss of past earning capacity, it is my view that Ms. Kirkham's diminished capacity to earn income from triathlon is more appropriately assessed at $3,500 per year. Applying the actuarial multiplier of 4,699 as set out in Ms. Kirkham's expert report, this amounts to <damage type = "sub-future wage loss">$16,500</damage> for the five years.
222  The total loss of future earning capacity for Ms. Kirkham is thus assessed as <damage type = "future wage loss">$86,500</damage>, comprising the loss associated with the delay in her career and the loss of prize money.
Cost of future care
223  Ms. Kirkham is entitled to compensation for the cost of future care based on what is reasonably necessary to restore her to her pre-accident condition insofar as that is possible. When full restoration cannot be achieved, the court must strive to assure full compensation through the provision of adequate future care. The award is to be based on what is reasonably necessary on the medical evidence to preserve and promote the plaintiff's mental and physical health: Gignac v. Rozylo, , at paras. 29-30. An assessment of damages for cost of future care is not a precise accounting exercise: Krangle (Guardian ad litem of) v. Brisco, , at para. 21.
224  The test for assessing an appropriate award for the cost of future care is an objective one based on the medical evidence. There must be a medical justification and the claims must be reasonable: Tsalamandris v. McLeod, , at paras. 62-63. The costs are justified if they are medically necessary and likely to be incurred. If the plaintiff has not used the particular service or item in the past, it may be inappropriate to include its costs in the future care award: O'Connell v. Yung, , at paras. 55, 60, 68-70.
225  Ms. Kirkham claims the following as giving rise to costs of future care:
physiotherapy three times per month for a year;
massage therapy once every three to four weeks for a year;
chiropractic treatments once a month for a year after the physiotherapy sessions end;
an athletic therapist or kinesiologist twice a month for three years while she completes her studies;
injections for her hip and knee pain (three treatments);
psychological counseling for a year;
an ergonomic assessment of her home-based workstation;
a lifetime of yoga; and
pain relief medications.
226  For the most part, Ms. Kirkham's claims were supported by her medical evidence. Dr. Boyle expressed the view that although a course of physiotherapy immediately following a soft tissue injury is appropriate, Ms. Kirkham no longer requires formal physiotherapy and is capable of simply exercising on her own. For the reasons already given, I prefer the medical evidence relied upon by Ms. Kirkham.
227  Ms. Kirkham's claim for ongoing physiotherapy for a year is supported by Dr. Finlayson, Dr. Lloyd-Smith, Dr. Gerrard, Ms. Lamy, and Mr. Campbell. On the basis of their evidence, I find that physiotherapy three times a month for the next year is reasonably necessary to preserve and promote Ms. Kirkham's health. Ms. Kirkham's brief of special damages contains a list of each item claimed. That list indicates Ms. Lamy's fee is $50. At three times a month, that amounts to <damage type = "sub-special">$1,800 per year</damage>.
228  Ms. Kirkham's claim for ongoing massage therapy is supported by Dr. Lloyd-Smith and Dr. Gerrard. On the basis of their evidence, I find that massage therapy once a month for a year is reasonably necessary to preserve and promote Ms. Kirkham's health. Ms. Kirkham's brief of special damages indicates the cost of massage therapy at $95 per session. At once a month, that amounts to <damage type = "sub-special">$1,140</damage> for the year.
229  Ms. Kirkham's claim for monthly chiropractic treatments for one year after the physiotherapy is supported by Dr. Lloyd-Smith and Dr. Gerrard. Although Ms. Kirkham had regular chiropractic care prior to the car accident, that was performance care and is different from the rehabilitation care provided by Dr. Gerrard after the accident. I find that chiropractic care once a month for a year following the completion of physiotherapy is reasonably necessary. Ms. Kirkham's brief of special damages indicates the cost of chiropractic care is $45 per session. At once a month, that amounts to <damage type = "sub-special">$540</damage> for a year.
230  Ms. Kirkham's claim for the services of an athletic therapist, kinesiologist or personal trainer such as Mr. Campbell is supported by Dr. Finlayson, but only for a year. Mr. Campbell suggested ongoing treatment for the duration of Ms. Kirkham's graduate and postdoctoral work, but it is not clear from his evidence whether this is in addition to the physiotherapy already addressed above. After considering all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the services of an athletic therapist or personal trainer are reasonably necessary, for a year, particularly if Ms. Kirkham is to have any chance of competing in triathlon again. Ms. Kirkham's brief of special damages indicates Mr. Campbell charges $140 per session. At twice a month, that amounts to <damage type = "sub-special">$3,360</damage> for a year.
231  I am not satisfied that injections for Ms. Kirkham's hip and knee pain are reasonably necessary. She has not yet had such injections. The only medical evidence suggesting such injections is Dr. Finlayson's view that "consideration should be given to" such injections if there is no improvement in her left hip girdle pain with ongoing rehabilitation. There was no evidence from Ms. Kirkham that she would undergo such injections. On balance, I am not satisfied that an award for these injections is justified.
232  Ms. Kirkham's claim for psychological counseling for a year is supported by Dr. Finlayson. However, I am not satisfied that Ms. Kirkham is likely to incur the cost. She saw a sports psychologist three times in 2013 but canceled her last appointment on the basis that she did not think further sessions were required.
233  Ms. Kirkham's claim for an ergonomic assessment of her home-based workstation is supported by Dr. Finlayson. In my view, it also supported by the evidence as a whole, as it is apparent that Ms. Kirkham's pain is exacerbated by computer work and that the modifications to her office workstation have helped. Ms. Kirkham seeks <damage type = "other">$1,200</damage> for the ergonomic assessment. In my view, that amount is justified.
234  Ms. Kirkham's claim for a lifetime of yoga is not, in my view, supported by the medical evidence. Dr. Lloyd-Smith expressed the view that Ms. Kirkham should continue with yoga and/or Pilates sessions to maintain her fitness, strength, flexibility and balance, but he did not express any view as to the appropriate duration of yoga. Mr. Campbell's report does not mention yoga, but he recommended to Ms. Kirkham in the fall of 2012 that she stop her triathlon training and restrict her physical activities to physiotherapy, yoga, Pilates, and strength training. His report simply recommends "some form of ongoing treatment" for the duration of her graduate and postdoctoral work. On consideration of all the evidence, I am satisfied that yoga for three years, while Ms. Kirkham finishes her studies, is justified, at <damage type = "other">$100</damage> per month.
235  Ms. Kirkham's claim for pain relief medication is supported by Dr. Lloyd-Smith. Ms. Kirkham seeks an award of <damage type = "other">$2,000</damage> for tramadol but without any explanation as to how that amount was calculated. Ms. Kirkham's special damages brief indicates that a 30-day supply of tramadol costs approximately $60. On this basis, I award $720 for pain relief medication based on the cost of tramadol for a year.
236  In summary, I assess Ms. Kirkham's cost of future care as follows:
the cost of physiotherapy (<damage type = "sub-future care">$1,800</damage>), massage therapy (<damage type = "sub-future care">$1,140</damage>), an athletic therapist (<damage type = "sub-future care">$3,360</damage>), and pain medication (<damage type = "sub-future care">$720</damage>) for a year, and the cost of chiropractic care (<damage type = "sub-future care">$540</damage>) for the year following the completion of physiotherapy treatment, which amounts to $7,413 using the future cost of care multipliers in Ms. Kirkham's expert economics report,
the cost of an ergonomic assessment at <damage type = "sub-future care">$1,200</damage>, and
the cost of yoga at <damage type = "other">$1,200</damage> per year for three years which amounts to <damage type = "sub-future care">$3,419</damage> using the future cost of care multiplier,
for a total of <damage type = "future care">$12,032</damage>.
Special damages
237  Ms. Kirkham is entitled to recover the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses she incurred as a result of the car accident. Claims for special damages are subject only to the standard of reasonableness; however, when expenses are incurred in relation to treatment aimed at the promotion of a plaintiff's physical or mental well-being, evidence of medical justification for the expense is a factor in determining reasonableness: Redl v. Sellin, , at para. 55.
238  Ms. Kirkham claims <damage type = "other">$35,683.91</damage> in special damages. That amount relates primarily to the costs she incurred for chiropractic care, massage therapy, physiotherapy, Pilates, and yoga. It also includes costs for medication and equipment such as a laptop stand and ice packs.
239  The defendant objects to Ms. Kirkham's special damages claim on two bases. First, the defendant submits that Ms. Kirkham's treatment was self-directed and excessive and did not follow a course set in consultation with a medical doctor. The defendant points out that Dr. Hall's recommendation of physiotherapy and Dr. Shiu's recommendation of physiotherapy, massage therapy, and chiropractic care were not established at trial, other than through Ms. Kirkham's hearsay. Accordingly, the defendant submits that on the medical evidence, Ms. Kirkham had not been recommended such treatments until, at the earliest, her first visit with Dr. Lloyd-Smith on May 5, 2011. The defendant submits that although Dr. Lloyd-Smith notes that Ms. Kirkham had instituted physiotherapy, massage therapy and chiropractic care once or twice a week, his report declined to endorse these treatments.
240  I do not accept that submission. Dr. Lloyd-Smith recommended continuing physiotherapy, massage therapy, chiropractic care, medication, trigger point injections yoga, and Pilates as future care. He was clearly aware that Ms. Kirkham had been engaging in these treatments since the car accident. While he may not have specifically said that he recommended she do so from the beginning, he certainly did not indicate that he disagreed with these therapies. While Dr. Lloyd-Smith did not see Ms. Kirkham until May 5, 2011, even Dr. Boyle testified as to the value in physiotherapy for the first six to eight weeks following a soft tissue injury. Finally, the medical evidence tendered by Ms. Kirkham as a whole established a consensus for ongoing physiotherapy, massage therapy, yoga, and Pilates with an eventual resumption of chiropractic care. If all of these treatments are recommended into the future, it is reasonable to infer that they were equally recommended in the past.
241  In my view, it is also necessary to keep in mind Ms. Kirkham's specific situation. She was an elite athlete who was endeavouring to regain her status. She cannot be faulted for her efforts in this regard. What is reasonable for Ms. Kirkham may not be reasonable for a plaintiff who had a more sedentary pre-accident lifestyle. Considering all the evidence, it is my view that the costs incurred by Ms. Kirkham meet the standard of reasonableness.
242  The defendant also objects to Ms. Kirkham's claim for special damages on the basis that as an elite athlete she received chiropractic treatments from Dr. Gerrard for performance care before the car accident and would have continued to incur that cost even if the car accident had not occurred. In my view, the principle that an expense cannot be recovered if it can be shown that an independent cause such as pre-existing injury would have necessitated the expense in any event is inapplicable to Ms. Kirkham's situation. She was not receiving chiropractic care for rehabilitation of injuries prior to the car accident. She was receiving performance care that assisted her in her efforts to become a top level triathlete. Dr. Gerrard testified that the nature of the care he provided to Ms. Kirkham after the car accident was different than that provided beforehand. In my view, disallowing Ms. Kirkham's claim for the costs of chiropractic care she incurred after the accident on the basis that she received performance care before the accident would be akin to reducing a plaintiff's special damages claim on the basis that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff have rendered the plaintiff incapable of participating in pre-accident activities and thereby have saved the plaintiff the costs associated with those activities.
243  For the foregoing reasons I find that Ms. Kirkham is entitled to reimbursement for the special damages she has claimed in the amount of <damage type = "special">$35,683.91</damage>.
CONCLUSION
244  In summary, the damages awarded to Ms. Kirkham are as follows:
Non-pecuniary damages <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$120,000</damage> 
Loss of past earning capacity <damage type = "past wage loss">13,200</damage> 
Loss of future earning capacity <damage type = "future wage loss">86,500</damage> 
Cost of future care <damage type = "future care">12,032</damage> 
Special damages <damage type = "special">35,684</damage> 
Total: <damage type = "total">$267,416</damage> 
245  If the parties are unable to agree on costs, they may speak to that issue.

INTRODUCTION
1  On September 30, 1995 the plaintiff was a lawyer practicing in Duncan, British Columbia. At mid-afternoon on that date he was arrested by the R.C.M.P. at his law office on an arrest warrant [Ex. 9, Tab 198] issued upon an information sworn by Mr. Bill Foster, a peace officer, alleging two counts of criminal conduct contrary to s. 264(3)(b) of the Criminal Code, one count concerning the defendant Patry, the other the defendant Anderson [Ex. 9, Tab 197].
2  The plaintiff appeared in Provincial Court in Victoria on October 2, 1995, and was remanded to October 16, 1995.
3  On October 30, 1995, the charges relating to the defendant Patry were stayed by the Crown [Ex. 9, Tab 207], and a new information regarding only the defendant Anderson was sworn. On November 21, 1995, that charge was stayed by the Attorney General [Ex. 9, Tab 210].
4  As a result of the actions of the defendants in respect of the judicial review, complaint to the Law Society, and his being charged, arrested, and detained, the plaintiff pursues this action for compensatory and punitive damages for malicious prosecution, abuse of process, negligence (against the defendant Patry only), and intentional infliction of mental suffering.
HISTORY
5  Some chronology of the convoluted history amongst the parties is necessary to an understanding of the events in issue.
6  The relationship of the plaintiff and the defendant Anderson, the manner in which the plaintiff and defendant Patry came into conflict, and the interaction between the defendants Anderson and Patry, form a bizarre background to the plaintiff's claims.
PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT ANDERSON
7  The plaintiff is 65 years of age and currently works as a pipe fitter in the tar sands of northern Alberta. He is a law school graduate, who articled with a Victoria law firm and was called to the Bar in 1977.
8  The defendant Anderson, a realtor, has had varied employment and small business pursuits over the years. She has had a disability since January 1986, when she sustained a head injury with consequent Post Traumatic Stress Disorder resulting from an assault during a robbery attempt at her place of employment.
9  The plaintiff first met the defendant Anderson in the summer of 1986, when he acted on behalf of the defendant Anderson's family and other trailer park residents in a dispute with their landlord. In the summer of 1988, the defendant Anderson contacted the plaintiff regarding her divorce, and from the fall of 1988 a romantic relationship ensued.
10  The defendant Anderson, from inception of her injuries in the robbery, had difficulty in obtaining recognition by the Workers Compensation Board of the scope and effect of her injuries, and their profound effect upon her. The defendant Anderson did not receive timely, necessary, and appropriate treatment for her Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and still continues with a serious memory deficit and need for psychological counselling or therapy.
11  The defendant Anderson blames the plaintiff for the break-up of her marriage, and believes that their relationship was one of abuse to her and her children.
12  The plaintiff's evidence is that he cared for the defendant and tried to help her over the years, and denies any suggestion of abuse.
13  The defendant Anderson characterizes her relationship with the plaintiff as founded on fear; and claims fear for her own safety, as well as that of her family and others.
14  The defendant Anderson now portrays the plaintiff as a violent person and alleges that he had asked her to commit suicide, jointly commit suicide, threatened to kill her and her husband, and said that he could have her father killed. Ms. Anderson alleges the plaintiff, in her presence, engaged in violence with her husband, and that he has stalked and harassed her. The defendant Anderson also referred in testimony to an incident of violence by the plaintiff that she witnessed at his home, which involved three young men and led to his pleading guilty to criminal charges.
15  The defendant Anderson constantly accuses the plaintiff of "seducing her away from her husband". The plaintiff denies that is what occurred, and testifies that the defendant Anderson had assured him her marriage was over before he pursued a relationship with her. The plaintiff never acted for her in respect of divorce, but he did refer her to a lawyer.
16  The plaintiff characterizes the relationship with the defendant Anderson as being "on and off" over the years. The plaintiff found the defendant Ms. Anderson was subject to mercurial mood swings and to have periods exhibiting intense hatred toward him.
17  The plaintiff was smitten with Ms. Anderson, but came to realize that marriage to her was not appropriate in light of the defendant Anderson's mental health issues. It is his evidence they tried every avenue to obtain help and treatment for her.
18  Although they would spend a good deal of time together, it appears they never actually lived together. The plaintiff was employed as a solicitor for the Lower Nicola Indian Band in Merritt from May 1993 through August 1994, and lived in Merritt travelling to Vancouver Island on some weekends.
19  The plaintiff and a woman named Ms. Bones started a relationship in December 1993, the plaintiff moved to Duncan in August 1994, and they became engaged. The relationship ended at Christmas 1994.
20  The plaintiff was employed from 1984 to 1989 as house counsel for West Coast Savings Credit Union. In 1989 there was a merger of credit unions, the plaintiff's employment was terminated, and he was given a severance package. The plaintiff was 50 years old and despite his best efforts, he was not able to find employment for approximately two years. He was severely depressed and received psychiatric treatment. The plaintiff and defendant Anderson, during this period when the plaintiff was not working, were drinking excessively, and they likely were alcoholics. They would at times quarrel, yell, use profanities, and at times be verbally hurtful of one another.
21  The plaintiff says that apart from one occasion, he was never physically violent to the defendant Anderson. That one occasion was when she openly taunted him regarding her sexual relationship with someone else, and he placed his hands on her neck and shook her.
22  The plaintiff admits that he may, in frustration of her constant talk of suicide, have told her to go ahead. He admits there was a time they talked of joint suicide when they were both depressed and saw that as the only way out.
23  The plaintiff denies making the death threats she alleges against her father, her husband, and her family. He admits there may have been some comments spoken as bravado and meant as support to her, regarding her father. The defendant Anderson alleges a history of horrific sexual abuse by her father as a child; she had charged him criminally and his prosecution was extant during part of her relationship with the plaintiff.
24  The defendant Anderson alleges the plaintiff showed her a sadomasochistic video, and told her he had shown it to his daughter. She alleged the plaintiff committed sexual improprieties with his daughter. The plaintiff vehemently denies these allegations, and his daughter, in evidence, wholly supports the denial.
25  The plaintiff did commit an act of violence to which he plead guilty and received a suspended sentence. The offence occurred in 1992 at his townhouse residence, and the defendant Anderson was present. The plaintiff's evidence is that three youths tried to kick in his door, so he grabbed a baseball bat and chased them to their parked van. The plaintiff smashed the van's windshield and as a result one of the youths received an eye injury from fragmented glass.
26  This incident occurred during the time the plaintiff was unemployed, depressed, taking medication and drinking heavily. He admits candidly that he "lost it" and had over-reacted. He said it was an isolated incident which he very much regrets.
27  The credibility of the defendant Anderson is seriously suspect. During the tenure of the relationship the defendant Anderson, while professing to be the victim of violence, living in fear of the plaintiff doing harm to her, her family, and acquaintances, wrote dozens of letters to the plaintiff proclaiming him to be the finest of men and the best thing that ever happened to her.
28  Ms. Anderson testified that whatever she wrote was the truth, and offered no explanation for the stark contrast in the allegations she raises against the plaintiff, and the dozens of her letters of love, praise, gratitude, and admiration. Fortunately, the plaintiff saved many of her letters and is able to roughly date the times they were written.
29  I conclude the plaintiff loved the defendant Anderson, but realized she was a deeply troubled person with mental health issues, and although he tried to assist her in obtaining help and treatment, he realized marriage to her was out of the question.
30  The defendant Anderson appears a mentally troubled and unstable woman badly damaged from incest in her childhood and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder following her head injury in 1988. She had a "love-hate" relationship with the plaintiff, as she considered that he reneged on a promise to marry her after seducing her from her husband. On one level, she views the plaintiff as ruining her life, and she appears in respect of matters involved in this action to be motivated by revenge.
31  The plaintiff and the defendant Patry first met in January 1992 when he was appointed as arbitrator of a landlord-tenant dispute commenced by Mr. Kirzinger as tenant against the defendant Patry as owner of the house he was renting. The plaintiff held hearings January 28, February 4, March 11, and May 27, 1992.
32  The plaintiff gave an oral decision on February 4, 1992 and written reasons followed February 17, 1992. A final decision concluding the matter which included incidental findings of misconduct by the defendant Patry as landlord was given in June 1992.
33  The defendant Patry complained of the plaintiff to several persons at the Residential Tenancy Branch throughout the hearing period, claiming that the plaintiff was unprofessional and biased.
34  The plaintiff's contract with the Residential Tenancy Branch was not renewed in March of 1992. There had been some complaints that the plaintiff's demeanour was pompous. Ms. Rossley, his superior, confirmed that there was no problem with the plaintiff as an arbitrator, and she had no difficulties in working with him. The resolution of the defendant Patry's arbitration was his last arbitration.
35  On August 17, 1992, the defendant Patry filed a lengthy Petition for a Judicial Review of the plaintiff's decisions of February 17, April 13 and June 24, 1992 [Ex. 7, Tab 129].
36  In early September, the defendant Patry wrote to both Ms. Rossley and to Ms. Rice, the Assistant Deputy Minister, with copies to the Ombudsman for B.C.
37  Allegations of bias, unprofessional conduct and an unfair arbitration hearing were made against the plaintiff. On October 6, 1992, the defendant Patry swore an affidavit, with exhibits of 177 pages, which was filed on October 8, 1992, attacking the plaintiff and the arbitration process [Ex. 7, Tab 131].
38  Ms. Rossley swore an affidavit in the Judicial Review proceeding in contradiction of what the defendant Patry had deposed. In particular, Ms. Rossley never advised the defendant Patry that she had the right to ask that the plaintiff step down as arbitrator on her request (although she could make the request with the Arbitrator to decide). Ms. Rossley never expressed the view she thought there was bias on the part of the plaintiff, or that the plaintiff should have instructed the tenant to serve a copy of the Order on the defendant Patry [Ex. 8, Tab 136].
39  As the Petition was highly personalized and critical of the plaintiff, he was instructed at government expense to retain Peter Butler Q.C. as counsel to represent him in the Judicial Review.
40  On January 29, 1993 the forceful attack launched by the defendant Patry against the plaintiff personally was demonstrated when she swore a 31 page affidavit outlining complaints that the plaintiff lied, confused her, intimidated her and her witnesses, interfered, butted in and was biased [Ex. 8, Tab 137].
41  The defendant Patry made serious accusations against the plaintiff of tape recording the proceedings without her knowledge. That was untrue as the tape recorder was large and central on the desk during hearings, and the tenant Mr. Kirzinger confirms his knowledge of its use. The defendant Patry alleged that tapes were altered. Mr. Justice Melvin, who reviewed the tapes that existed, found them invaluable in concluding the tenor of the hearing, and contrary to the defendant Patry's allegations of impropriety and bias.
42  It is to be noted Mr. Kirzinger does not support the flagrant abuses of the plaintiff's behaviour alleged by the defendant Patry.
43  The first hearing on the Judicial Review commenced January 29, 1993 before Mr. Justice Hutchison. The plaintiff attended and was accompanied by the defendant Ms. Anderson. Ms. Anderson heard the defendant Patry make her wide-ranging accusations regarding the plaintiff's conduct at the hearing. It was following listening to the defendant Patry speak about him in Court that he was so enraged with her false accusations that he did, in speaking to the defendant Anderson, refer to the defendant Patry as "a bitch". Ms. Anderson had suggested that he had referred to the defendant Patry as "a bitch" prior to the hearing day.
44  The defendant Anderson recalled that she had once seen or met the defendant Patry, who was the attending doctor when a friend had a baby. The plaintiff in May 1993 moved to Merritt B.C. to take up employment with an Indian Band. In the first half of 1993 the defendant Anderson wrote to the plaintiff expressing her love and respect, and that he was a "good man", the "Greatest Man" and that she had "died a thousand deaths since you moved away" [Ex. 8, Tab 138-140].
45  In June 1993, the defendant Patry swore an affidavit in the Judicial Review proceeding which with exhibits exceeded 120 pages [Ex. 8, Tab 141]. The affidavit repeats and expands her views as to the plaintiff's bias, dishonesty, arrogance, and unjust conduct. The affidavit also focuses an attack of the plaintiff on her analysis of the existing tape recordings, allegations of editing, tampering with the tapes, or their destruction.
46  By November 1993, the defendants Anderson and Patry had met and started discussions about the plaintiff. The contact was made by the defendant Anderson to the defendant Patry. The defendant Patry taped several conversions with the defendant Anderson over concern of what she was being told, but she appears to have unreservedly accepted it as true.
47  The defendants collaborated from late 1993 to February 1994 with personal meetings and telephone conversations. The defendant Anderson also worked for the defendant Patry for a short time. The result of their discussions was the drafting of an affidavit in the Judicial Review proceeding which the defendant Anderson swore.
48  During this same period, from the fall of 1993 to February 1994, the plaintiff was in Merritt employed by the Lower Nicola Indian Band, and the defendant Anderson continued to write him expressing her love for him and that he was "one fine gentleman" [Ex. 8, Tab 143-144].
49  In December 1993 the plaintiff started his relationship with Ms. Bones. In August 1994, the plaintiff moved to Duncan B.C., became engaged to be married, and was employed by a law firm in Duncan.
50  On February 2, 1994, the defendant Anderson swore her affidavit in the Judicial Review proceeding, but it was not filed. The drafting of the affidavit was likely that of the defendant Patry, certainly with her influence, and incorporated matters that she was told by the defendant Anderson in their many discussions regarding the plaintiff. I accept the affidavit was largely a blend of untruths, partial truths distorted by removal from context, and with misleading exaggeration.
51  The defendant Patry considered the affidavit supported her attack upon the plaintiff as it was proof, inter alia, that he was unpredictable, mentally unstable, manipulative, prejudiced, and lacked for honesty and morals.
52  In February 1994, the defendant Patry was attempting to enlist the aid of the police in respect of possible criminal offences committed by the plaintiff on the basis of her allegations he tampered with the tape recordings from the hearing.
53  A letter to police of February 28, 1994 [Ex. 8, Tab 150] was in furtherance of an earlier conversation of November 24, 1993. The letter contains several false statements about the plaintiff, including that he had lost his job with West Coast Savings Credit Union for incompetence, had to quit private practice because of an assault of three men, that he fled Vancouver Island due to publicity, and that he was no longer a member in good standing of the Law Society of B.C.
54  The defendant Patry purports to offer her medical opinion that the plaintiff:
... has a problem with mental psychosis and/or paranoid compulsive personality disorder and was on anti-psychotic medication for extended periods and has been followed by a psychiatrist on a long term basis ...
... according to his ex-girlfriend, he has several times threatened to kill her and has attempted to choke her, and he demonstrates violent psychotic behavior.
55  On March 1, 1994, the defendant Patry sent the police department a copy of the defendant Anderson's affidavit and asked it be reviewed but not acted upon without discussion with her, because she was concerned for the safety of her and the defendant Anderson and their children.
56  On March 7, 1994, the defendant Patry took another tack in her attack on the plaintiff by writing to the Law Society of B.C. to urge they take disciplinary action. The letter contained affidavits in the Judicial Review proceeding (including the unfiled affidavit of the defendant Anderson which she did not want revealed). Among the many accusations raised in the letter is again reference to her opinion as a physician that: "... he needed psychiatric help and that he was not fully in touch with the reality of the situation".
57  The Law Society wrote the defendant Patry on April 18, 1994, advising they would not be asking the plaintiff for an explanation at that time. The plaintiff became aware in April 1994 that the defendant Patry had complained about him.
58  At this time, the defendant Anderson, by letter of April 22, 1994 wrote asking the plaintiff to "... forgive the pain and cruelties she had caused by lashing out her pain and fury" on him [Ex. 8, Tab 155].
59  On May 13, 1994 the Law Society wrote the defendant Patry saying they had given the plaintiff a copy of the defendant Anderson's unfiled affidavit.
60  On May 16, 1994 the defendant Anderson wrote to the plaintiff in Merritt, having previously said she would not write further, as he had not responded to her prior letters. In this letter she again expresses her love for the plaintiff and reiterates that she took out her rage and pain on him [Ex. 8, Tab 159].
61  The plaintiff wrote the defendant Anderson June 1, 1994, after learning for the first time of the affidavit she had sworn, expressing that he did not know she hated him so much [Ex. 7, Tab 125, p. 49]. She replied on June 15, giving her reasons for her actions [Ex. 7, Tab 163].
62  The Law Society, on June 7, 1994, wrote that they would not pursue the defendant Patry's allegations, as they were speculative and unproven [Ex. 8, Tab 162]. The defendant Patry wrote a letter June 13, 1994 objecting and saying that release of the defendant Anderson's affidavit jeopardized the lives of the defendants' families. On July 26, 1994, the Law Society wrote in reply and explained again the reason for release of the affidavit.
63  On July 27, 1994 the defendant Anderson wrote the plaintiff a threatening letter [Ex. 8, Tab 165], but a week later on August 4, 1994, she wrote she was not going to pursue legal action and ending stating "... I was hurt because we never married, I just lashed out with everything I had" [Ex. 8, Tab 166].
64  In August 1994, the plaintiff moved to Duncan to live with Ms. Bones, and on September 15, 1994, the defendant Anderson's affidavit sworn February 2, 1994, was filed in the Judicial Review proceeding.
65  In the fall of 1994, the defendant Anderson continued to write the plaintiff expressing her love, and in particular wrote on October 15, 1994 a letter of apology and suggested he use the letter to clear his name and reputation that she felt was damaged due to his involvement with her. The letter expresses her love, desire and admiration for him. She describes him as a "man of great character, intellect, passion, talent, tenderness and sensitivity".
66  The letter is a powerful admission of how she had wronged the plaintiff in her involvement with the defendant Patry [Ex. 8, Tab 169].
67  The relationship of the plaintiff and Ms. Bones ended at Christmas 1994, and in January 1995 the plaintiff and defendant Anderson met and discussed the damage her affidavit created. It was agreed that to correct matters she would swear a new affidavit which would adhere strictly to the truth. To assist her, it was arranged for her to work with David Johnson, a psychologist who had treated her and for whom she had the greatest respect and trust. The plaintiff, at David Johnson's suggestion, attended some of their sessions.
68  In February 1995, the defendant Anderson wrote a long unsigned Statement apparently in explanation of why she swore her first affidavit, that she wished to retract and that she was working with David Johnson to help her clear up inaccuracies in her first affidavit [Ex. 8, Tabs 171-173].
69  It is of interest that in one of the sessions with David Johnson, the defendant Anderson became angry with the plaintiff, swung a briefcase at him, and broke his arm. She also recalled past anger when she slit the tires on his car, slashed his car convertible top, and taunted and tormented him.
70  The plaintiff became upset when the defendant Anderson would not sign the new affidavit drafted, and on February 29, 1995 wrote to David Johnson requesting he tell her not to contact him again or interfere with him or he would get a restraining order against her. He stated he did not care if she signed the affidavit or not [Ex. 1, Tab 7].
71  The plaintiff on March 7, 1995, after meetings with David Johnson, swore a new affidavit [Ex. 8, Tab 174] and the plaintiff provided the defendant Anderson with a letter of Release against legal action conditional on her maintaining the truth.
72  The plaintiff arranged for the payment of the defendant Anderson's phone bill for the one month period in January to February 1995, when the process to create the supplementary affidavit occurred. The bill disclosed forty long distance calls from the defendant Anderson in Victoria to the plaintiff in Duncan.
73  Counsel for the plaintiff arranged payment to David Johnson for his counselling services related to the supplementary affidavit. When the defendant Anderson learned of the payment of David Johnson's account, she became irate and claimed he had breached her trust.
74  On March 31, 1995 the plaintiff left the employ of Orchard & Co. in Duncan and opened his own office. The parting was not on good terms, and the plaintiff was asked to leave. He had been working on some files for a local Indian Band and when he started his own practice, they requested the files be transferred to him.
75  From April through September 1995, the defendant Anderson wrote a number of friendly letters to the plaintiff which, in varying degrees, expressed her love and need for him [Exs. 8 and 9, Tabs 176-183; Tabs 185 and 186]. One letter in the summer of 1995 was an exception to this pattern, with its tone and style of writing indicative of anger [Ex. 9, Tab 184].
76  A letter written in September 1995 expressed her love and wishes to marry him [Ex. 9, Tab 186].
77  The defendant Anderson left a note on September 12, 1995 for the plaintiff to call her [Ex. 9, Tab 187]. The plaintiff left several messages for the defendant Anderson to call him, and when she was not returning calls, he drove to her apartment, sat in his car or on a park bench to await her return. The defendant Anderson was home, but would not answer the door. There is no evidence the messages left on her answering machine were threatening or harassing, nor did his waiting to see if she would return home in the circumstances be considered "stalking".
78  The defendant Anderson swore another supplementary affidavit September 20, 1995 and filed it that day [Ex. 9, Tab 188]. This was her third affidavit and alleges her second affidavit filed to correct her first affidavit was coerced by the plaintiff.
79  On September 22, 1995 the defendant Patry filed a statement with Victoria police referring to her earlier letter in February 1994 concerning the hearing tapes.
80  She stated she was applying September 25, 1995 for a no contact order and that she feared for herself, children and family and the plaintiff was the source of the threat to her. She wanted police protection for each of the defendants as they were in physical danger [Ex. 9, Tab 189]. The same day, the defendant Anderson filed a statement with police canvassing her historical accusations about the plaintiff over the period of their relationship, and claimed her second affidavit was coerced by the plaintiff threatening suicide if she did not comply, and that he bullied, screamed and yelled, berated and belittled her until she caved in. She wanted a no contact order to protect herself and her family [Ex. 9, Tab 190].
81  September 25, 1995 the defendant Patry, supported by the defendant Anderson, sought an ex parte order by application in the Judicial Review proceeding for a no contact order. The application contained a long series of allegations including threatening, harassing and stalking the defendants and Ms. Bones and they all feared for their lives and safety [Ex. 9, Tab 192].
82  The defendant Patry filed her own affidavit quoting fear in serving affidavits, and alleging the plaintiff was criminally harassing and stalking the defendants and Ms. Bones, and he was instructing the defendant Anderson to commit suicide, thereby intimidating a witness into swearing a supplementary affidavit [Ex. 9, Tab 193].
83  On September 27, 1995, the defendant Patry delivered a seventeen page statement to the Victoria police. It contains false statements, accusations, exaggeration and fantasy concerning the plaintiff. It was extremely vindictive and laced with her views and opinions. One of dozens of the allegations made was that she knew the plaintiff was dishonest, threatening, and extremely manipulative, without scruples, but further in her opinion "... he was a narcissistic sociopath capable of anything criminal" [Ex. 9, Tab 194].
84  On September 26, 1995, the defendant Anderson made a three page written statement to police [Ex. 9, Tab 195].
85  On September 28, 1995 a report was made by the police to Crown counsel on the basis of the defendants' statements. The report proposed a charge of Criminal harassment under s. 264 (1) of the Criminal Code [Ex. 9, Tab 191].
86  On September 30, 1995, an information was sworn by a peace officer, Bill Foster, charging two counts under s. 264(3)(b) of the Criminal Code and a warrant for the plaintiff's arrest issued [Ex. 9, Tab 198].
87  The plaintiff was then arrested at 2:30 p.m. that day at his office in Duncan.
88  On October 2, 1995, the plaintiff was remanded to October 16, 1995, and the defendant Patry wrote an "urgent" request to the Law Society that they take criminal action against the plaintiff [Ex. 9, Tab 200]. The Judicial Review also proceeded to hearing that day before Mr. Justice Melvin, and it was adjourned sine die the following day because of the plaintiff's arrest.
89  On October 7, 1995, the defendant Anderson provided police and Crown with fourteen pages of allegations and requests for charges of corruption against David Johnson, and six named lawyers including Peter Butler Q.C., who were said to be conspirators to discredit, hurt and possibly kill her to protect the plaintiff. She alleges there was a cover-up and suspicion of organized crime and corruption.
90  On October 13, 1995, the defendant Patry demanded to know why Crown did not lay charges regarding the supplementary affidavit of Ms. Anderson. On October 19, 1995 the defendant Anderson inquired of Crown if it could look into corruption in the Law Society.
91  On October 24, 1955, the defendant Patry met with Crown and was told charges were to be stayed. The defendant stated she would not let the matter die, and would go to Crown's superiors and the press.
92  On October 30, 1995, the charges relating to the defendant Patry were stayed and a new Information regarding the defendant Anderson was sworn [Ex. 9, Tab 207].
93  On November 21, 1995, the charges relating to the defendant Anderson were stayed [Ex. 9, Tab 210].
94  The following day, the defendant Anderson spoke to Crown and was yelling and belligerent. She was threatening to go to the Attorney-General and the press, and that she would "have Crown's job".
95  On November 28, 1995, the defendant Anderson met again with Crown and maintained she wanted a criminal conviction. She was told it was impossible to prove criminal harassment of her.
96  A month later on December 29, 1995, the defendant Anderson wrote the plaintiff of her love for him, but stated she had to defend herself, the defendant Patry and Ms. Bones from his "rage and vengeance".
97  She apologizes for the "... trouble we made ..." and that she missed seeing him every day and night [Ex. 9, Tab 212].
98  Two days later on December 31, 1995, the defendant Anderson again wrote to the plaintiff that "... If things don't work out properly with your new girlfriend and you'd like to work things out with me, please call. I am still very much in love with you." It ended "To the Greatest Man I have ever known".
99  In stark contrast, the defendant Anderson wrote the Law Society, enclosing thirty-nine documents and continuing her allegations of criminal conduct against the plaintiff [Ex. 9, Tab 214].
100  On January 15, 1996, she wrote the defendant Patry to thank her for her help in getting away from the plaintiff, and her dedication and assistance to help her break free from this cruel and vengeful man. On the same day, she wrote the Law Society [Ex. 9, Tab 217] demanding an immediate investigation and oral hearing. She also wrote that day to Crown and demanded a hearing before a judge [Ex. 9, Tab 216].
101  Through the months of February, March and April 1996, the defendant Anderson kept up her insistence that the Crown take action on her many allegations against the plaintiff, and also pursued having the Law Society hold a hearing [Ex. 9, Tab 219-226].
102  On April 16, 1996, Mr. Justice Melvin dismissed the defendant Patry's "ill conceived" petition with costs after reviewing the tapes from the hearing and defendant Patry's sixty page brief.
103  The defendant Anderson kept up correspondence to the Law Society although the tenor of her letters changed significantly. On August 6, 1996 she wrote, in part:
David Johnston was the kindest, most generous man I ever met. He provided me with safe free counselling. He proved there are good men in the world that care.
104  She wrote further that she realized that she hurt Barrie (the plaintiff):
... due to my own deep, unresolved traumas and reaction to overwhelming losses. I am sorry and willing to make restitution if he so requests. [Ex. 19]
105  The defendant Patry, on September 28, 1998, was still writing the Law Society that her complaint against the Plaintiff ought not to have closed. The Law Society responded it was closed, the complaint speculative [Ex. 9, Tab 235].
106  There was some contact between the plaintiff and the defendant Anderson over the ensuing years despite the existence of this lawsuit. Their interaction for the most part seemed relatively caring and civil. That state was however abruptly broken in 2005 when the defendant Anderson candidly admits she informed the R.C.M.P. that the plaintiff was responsible for the murder of a young person, "Jennifer" in the B.C. interior. The plaintiff was pulled from his jobsite in Alberta by police, questioned and released. Astoundingly, the defendant Anderson testified she had no particular basis to accuse him of the murder, other than she believed it and that he was capable of murder.
POST ARREST
107  The evidence of the plaintiff is that following his arrest his life went into a tailspin. He was ashamed and publicly humiliated. His arrest was reported in the local Duncan and the Victoria press. His criminal counsel at the time observed in her evidence that he just seemed to crumble in he aftermath of his arrest. He was unable to focus and could not practice law effectively. He was dysfunctional and incapable of basic administrative detail. He got into trouble with the Law Society over inability to keep his trust accounts properly maintained. His practice dwindled and he ceased to practice December 31, 1995.
108  The plaintiff was depressed and suicidal and completely unable to function normally. He was living in his car, unable to afford accommodation. He was forced to obtain social assistance; he became reclusive and felt shunned by his friends.
109  On Christmas day 1995, he attempted suicide by a massive dosage of Aspirin. On January 6, 1996, his birthday, he tried again.
110  The plaintiff feels extremely fortunate that he met Ms. Parr, a woman he attributes to saving his life. He met her in the early spring of 1996 and lived with her and her two sons until 1997, when he obtained employment with the Indian Affairs Department and moved to Vancouver. He was supervisor of a unit of eight to ten lawyers working on the estates of natives. He held that position in excess of a year and a half. The plaintiff liked the job but would "break down" at times and experienced crying jags. In the summer of 1999 his contract expired and it was not renewed.
111  The plaintiff following his arrest had severe sleep problems and could only sleep for two or three hours at a time. He fought his depression, and quit liquor and drugs, but started to over-eat in compensation. His weight ballooned to an extreme high of 321 pounds, precipitated a heart attack and became a wake up call for him. He was in extremely poor physical health.
112  The plaintiff applied unsuccessfully for many positions after leaving Indian Affairs. It seemed fruitless for him to continue to attempt to obtain work as a lawyer, and he eventually went to Alberta where it was suggested he could become a pipe-fitter/high-rigger. He began to work in the tar sands and oil fields. It is extremely hard physical work, involving climbing high ladders in adverse weather conditions, and working long hours.
113  The work sites are isolated and living conditions are basic, can be unsanitary, and are crowded. The plaintiff feels the hard physical labour has been his saviour, and he has met the challenges of doing so at his older age. He should be very proud of what he has accomplished in rebuilding his health and his life.
114  The plaintiff's hard work has also been extremely rewarding financially. It has far surpassed what he had earned, or was likely to earn, in the practice of law. In 1993-1994, for two day a week part-time work the plaintiff had income of approximately <damage type = "other">$35,000</damage>. In 1995, the year of his arrest, after payment of his debts he had income of less than $100. In 1996 and 1997 he had income of respectively about <damage type = "other">$5,000</damage> and <damage type = "other">$13,000</damage> inclusive of social assistance payments.
115  Currently the plaintiff's income is in the range of <damage type = "other">$150,000</damage> per year and although his remuneration far outweighs his historic income from the practice of law, it comes with a price of living in remote areas, and the work sites cannot compare with the comforts of working in an urban office setting, doing work you enjoy. He had worked hard to earn the right to become a professional person.
LIMITATION DEFENCES
116  Counsel for the defendant Patry argues that the Information charging the plaintiff with two counts of harassment was sworn September 30, 1995. The defendant Patry had met with Constable Weiss mid-afternoon of September 25, 1995, and in his report to Crown counsel September 28, 1995 he refers to some statements attributed to her.
117  Counsel notes that this proceeding alleging malicious prosecution was commenced September 26, 1997, and is more than two years after the defendant Patry had spoken with Constable Weiss, and therefore beyond the two years of the plaintiff's right to bring such action pursuant to s. 3(3)(e) of the Limitation Act. The question is posed as whether the applicable time for bringing action was the date the defendant Patry contributed information ultimately written into the Report to Crown Counsel or when the plaintiff was arrested on September 30, 1995.
118  Counsel seeks to draw an analogy to an action for defamation, which, if actionable per se, must, pursuant to the Limitation Act, be brought within two years of publication [Gatley on Libel and Slander, 7th Edition, post 831]. It is argued that it is the defendant Patry's involvement with Constable Weiss that is the core of the assertion of malicious prosecution, and therefore it is the date of that event which is the commencement of the limitation at issue.
119  Time in the case of malicious prosecution cannot run, however, until the cause of action is completed by the proceedings having been terminated in the plaintiff's favour, which did not occur until October 1995. The suggestion that a stay is not a resolution of the proceeding would lead to an even wider period of limitation to the time when the two year limitation on bringing a charge would occur. There would also be no damages sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the impugned conduct of the defendant Patry until a charge occurred. The time running between a statement to police and the action upon it in laying a charge cannot, when the plaintiff has no knowledge of the occurrence, impinge upon the two year limitation period.
120  I find that the action for malicious prosecution was commenced within the two year limitation period in respect of malicious prosecution.
121  Counsel for the defendant Patry attacks the addition of causes of action for negligence, intentional infliction of mental suffering, and abuse of process, which were added to the action by amendment beyond the expiry of the time limitations applicable. It is argued that negligence was first added in paragraph 12 of an Amended Statement of Claim filed September 21, 1998 and is therefore out of time as beyond the two year limitation of s. 3(2)(a) of the Limitation Act.
122  It appears that the claim for negligence is one for other than injury to the person or property, and would therefore be governed by a six year limitation. The damages alleged in respect of the defendant Patry began on September 30, 1995, and negligence has been alleged, if not in the original pleading, has since the September 21, 1998 amendment, which is within the six year limitation regarding negligence and abuse of process. Counsel for the plaintiff argues that later amendments do not change those claims but only provide more detail.
123  Counsel could not advise the court of the dates when various amendments were requested, when agreements were made to permit amendments, and how long it took before amendments were prepared and amended pleadings filed. The amended pleadings, as of the date of trial, had survived three applications by the defendants to strike pleadings.
124  The amendments that occurred to add causes of action in respect of negligence, intentional infliction of mental suffering, and abuse of process come within the ambit of s. 4(4) of the Limitation Act, which permits an addition of a cause of action "... even if between the issue of the writ and the application for amendment a fresh cause of action disclosed by the amendment would have become barred by the lapse of time".
125  An amendment made out of time is to be considered, but is not a bar even if the amendment would defeat a limitation defence a defendant wished to raise [Romanchuk v. Revelstoke (City),  (S.C.); Abdel-Magid v. Simon Fraser University, ].
126  I find the causes of action for negligence, abuse of process, and intentional infliction of mental suffering are not barred by limitation. The pleadings may be inelegant and developed patchwork through amendment, but are adequate in support of the facts plead.
THE LAW
Malicious Prosecution
127  The leading Canadian authority on the tort of malicious prosecution is Nelles v. Ontario, . The elements necessary to succeed in an action for malicious prosecution are set out at para. 42:
the proceedings must have been initiated by the defendant;
the proceedings must have terminated in favour of the plaintiff;
the absence of reasonable and probable cause;
malice, or a primary purpose other than that of carrying the law into effect.
[See also John G. Fleming, The Law of Torts, 5th ed. (Sydney: Law Book Co., 1977) at p. 598]
128  The Court at para.43 set out the definition of reasonable and probable cause from Hicks v. Faulkner (1881), 8 Q.B.D. 167 at 171, Hawkins J., aff'd 46 L.T. 130 (C.A.):
... an honest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded on reasonable grounds, of the existence of a state of circumstances, which, assuming them to be true, would reasonably lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man, placed in the position of the accuser, to the conclusion that the person charged was probably guilty of the crime imputed ...
129  The test is therefore said to contain both a subjective belief on the part of the prosecutor and that belief must objectively be reasonable in the circumstances.
130  In regard to the requirement for malice, the Court in Nelles, supra at para. 45 noted that:
The required element of malice is for all intents, the equivalent of "improper purpose". It has according to Fleming, a "wider meaning than spite, ill-will or a spirit of vengeance, and includes any other improper purpose, such as to gain a private collateral advantage" (Fleming, op. cit., at p. 609).
131  In Petrovich v. Campbell,  (S.C.) (Q.L.), Mr. Justice Sheppard approved of the test for the first element of whether the proceedings were initiated by the defendant as set out in Fleming on the Law of Torts, 7th Ed., p. 582:
To incur liability, the defendant must play an active role in the conduct of the proceedings, as by "instigating" or setting them in motion ... The defendant must have been "actively instrumental" in setting the law in motion. Simply giving a candid account, however incriminating, to the police or magistrate is not the equivalent of launching a prosecution: the critical decision to prosecute not being his, 'the stone set rolling [is] a stone of suspicion only.'
132  If therefore only a candid account of an incident is given by person to the police, the requirement will likely not be met. However, Sheppard J. found it was malicious where, in addition to an account to police, a person is adamant that a charge be laid, gives false information, and withholds information that made the statement to police "slanted" rather than "candid".
133  The rational is, of course, that if slanted or untrue information is provided to the police, the decision to lay a charge by the prosecuting authority is prejudiced.
134  In Reilly v. British Columbia (Attorney General), , provides a detailed review of the definition and elements of malice at para. 20, and in part refers to a succinct statement quoted from Klar (Rainaldi, ed.), Remedies in Tort, loose-leaf (Toronto: Thomson, 1987), Vol. 1, 15-30 to 15-33, where it is stated at 15-30, and found common with the views of other text authors:
Malice in fact must be proved by the plaintiff; this can be done in one of two ways: (i) by showing what the motive was and that it was improper; or (ii) by showing that the circumstances were such that prosecution can only be accounted for by implying some wrong or indirect motive to the prosecutor, although it may be impossible to say what it was. Where an inference of malice is drawn, it should be made from the conduct of the defendant at the time he instituted proceedings.
135  The authorities support the view that without doubt in an appropriate case it is proper to infer malice from the absence of reasonable and probable cause to commence a prosecution.
APPLICATION TO THE DEFENDANTS
136  I find that the elements of the tort of malicious prosecution have been met. The defendants clearly initiated the process leading to the plaintiffs being charged when they attended upon the police, filed their statements, and wanted the plaintiff charged.
137  There is no evidence that the police were acting on any complaints other than those of the defendants. The conduct and actions of the defendants must be viewed on the basis of their statements and actions in seeking to have the plaintiff charged, not simply on the truncated version later distilled in Report of Crown Counsel.
138  Their statements were far from a candid account and contained untrue and inflammatory accusations. Statements were slanted to allege urgency and danger. They falsely conveyed the impression lives were in danger. The defendants importuned several Crown counsel to have charges laid and maintained.
139  The Report to Crown counsel was made September 28, 1995 and the warrant and arrest of the plaintiff occured September 30, 1995. There is nothing to suggest any basis other than the actions of the defendants were the cause for charges.
140  The defendants were outraged when told charges were to be stayed. They were abusive of Crown counsel, threatened going to superiors and the media, and demanded in some manner to appeal the stay decisions.
141  I am satisfied that the proceeding leading to the charge and arrest of the plaintiff on the charges of harassment were instigated by the defendants.
142  The charge in respect of each defendant was stayed, and as previously noted was vehemently protested by both of them. I am satisfied the stay was clearly a termination of the proceeding in the plaintiffs favour.
143  I find that there is no evidence to support reasonable and probable cause. The defendant Patry's claims of fear and danger were without foundation. She had no involvement with the accused giving rise to reason to be in fear, nor have any concern for her physical safety. He had not been in her physical presence since the arbitration and had not spoken with her. That her application to the Supreme Court for a restraining order had been dismissed was a matter which she also withheld from the police.
144  The plaintiff had been reported to have referred to her as a "bitch" during the time of the Judicial Review, and it had been reported to her that he had said he would sue her and take her car and house. It was clear to her those comments were spoken in response to her personal attack upon him in the in the Judicial Review, and were never in the context of any threat of physical violence or criminal action.
145  The plaintiff used her status as a medical doctor to falsely brand the plaintiff as a mentally dangerous person. This was highly reprehensible conduct on her part. The defendant Patry's allegations of danger and threats to her mother and children were completely groundless and deliberately misleading.
146  The short time from charge to the stay of the charges is also indicative that no real and probable cause existed to support the allegations being made.
147  I agree with the comment of counsel that the defendant Anderson was clearly a troubled woman, with an apparently deeply seated desire to blame many of her problems on the plaintiff for failing to support and marry her. I regret that I must approach her evidence with extreme caution given the many instances where it has been contradicted by others and inconsistent with her own evidence on other occasions.
148  In the Judicial Review proceeding, she filed three contradictory affidavits. She has demonstrated a disturbing pattern of taking actions or statements out of context and giving them unwarranted sinister application. She demonstrated a significant memory deficit during the course of her evidence which at times makes it difficult to understand her evidence or weight that can accorded to it.
149  The dozens of letters of the defendant Anderson in evidence that I have reviewed indicate that the plaintiff in September 1995 when speaking with the police was in one of the "hate" portions of the "love-hate cycle" regarding how she viewed her relationship with the plaintiff.
150  I do not accept that the telephone messages the plaintiff left when he was attempting to contact her, or the day he waited outside her apartment for her to return home, were in any sense harassment. I do not accept that the defendant Anderson had any real fear of the defendant, nor on the evidence was there any reason for her to fear him. I am sure however, because of her conduct, she did not wish to see him at that particular time. That was because the defendant Anderson had once more sworn an affidavit (the third) in the Judicial Review proceeding resiling from the second affidavit filed to correct the first affidavit, and was avoiding the defendant as she knew he would be upset, given what he had gone through to obtain her second affidavit, which was prepared to correct her first affidavit.
151  Finally, in my view there was clearly malice on the part of both defendants and a primary purpose other than that of carrying the law into effect. The defendant Anderson was motivated by her anger at the plaintiff's failure to marry and support her, and her perception that he was in some manner to blame for ruining her life. She wanted revenge by having him punished. That was her motive in contacting the defendant Patry, providing affidavits for her use in the Judicial Review proceeding, making of complaints to the Law Society, and finally in seeking to have him charged by the police.
152  The defendant Anderson's hate for the plaintiff was palpable during the evidence she gave at trial. I have no doubt the defendant Patry was the one who was instrumental in having the defendant Anderson swear affidavits in the Judicial Review proceeding, register complaints with the Law Society and to seek criminal charges being laid. The defendant Patry immersed the defendant Anderson in the vendetta she was waging against the plaintiff. The defendant Anderson's moods of intense hate for the plaintiff gained new focus following her association with the defendant Patry, and the result was devastating to the plaintiff.
153  The defendant Patry formed an intense dislike of the plaintiff and a desire for revenge for his finding against her in the Arbitration, which grew and expanded beyond her properly seeking redress of a legal wrong into a vendetta to strip him of his job, professional standing, and finally to have him subjected to criminal prosecution.
154  The defendant Patry, during the course of the Arbitration, complained about the plaintiff to the Residential Tenancy Branch personnel. She wanted him removed from her arbitration. Following his decision with an award of <damage type = "other">$1,500</damage> in damages against her, she was furious and wanted him fired, and she importuned his superiors and various government officials to be certain his contract was not renewed.
155  The defendant Patry appealed by way of Judicial Review, which was a proper course for her to follow, however her appeal was almost entirely an attack in one form or another on the plaintiff's character, competence, honesty, and professionalism. The defendant Patry's allegations were unproven in the Judicial Review proceeding. Mr. Justice Melvin found she was accorded a fair hearing and her attack on the plaintiff in the Judicial Review was "ill advised".
156  That attack in Judicial Review, however, was not enough to satisfy her. She sought to have the police charge the plaintiff criminally for tampering, altering or destroying tape recordings of the Arbitration. She complained to the Law Society seeking to affect the plaintiff's professional standing. She began to expand her attack on the plaintiff to brand him as violent and dangerous, diagnose him as a psychopath, and without attempt to verify the accuracy of various untruths she heard, passed on to others "rumours", including that he had been castrated and that he had been terminated with the Credit Union because of unacceptable performance. In the confines of the Judicial Review, there was opportunity for the plaintiff to defend himself against unjustified accusations, however out its confines he was the more vulnerable.
157  The culmination of her efforts was the attempt to have him charged criminally at a time which coincided with the hearing about to commence before Mr. Justice Melvin.
158  The two defendants each for their separate reasons finally succeeded in bringing down the plaintiff and inflicting serious punishment on him. It was neither threat nor fear that grounded their campaign to have the plaintiff charged criminally; it was hate and the improper purpose of punishing him and gaining advantage in the Judicial Review proceeding.
ABUSE OF PROCESS, NEGLIGENCE, INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF MENTAL SUFFERING
159  The torts of abuse of process, negligence, and intentional infliction of mental suffering are in large measure duplicitous of the tort of malicious prosecution although there are some distinctions among them. In view of my finding that the tort of malicious prosecution has been made out, I intend to deal with the remaining alleged torts in more summary fashion.
Abuse of Process
160  The tort of abuse of process is more often found in civil than in criminal context. The elements are that:
the defendant must have used the legal process for a purpose other than it was designed to serve, in other words for a collateral or illicit purpose,
the defendant must also have done some definite act or made some definite threat in furtherance of the improper purpose; and
some measure of damages must be shown.
161  In Guilford Industries Ltd. v. Hankinson Management Services Ltd. ,  (BCSC), Mr. Justice Anderson refers at para. 26 to Fleming on Torts to illustrate the essential difference of the tort of abuse of process from the tort of malicious prosecution.
... Quite distinct, however, are cases where a legal process, not itself devoid of foundation, has been perverted to accomplish some extraneous purpose, such as extortion or oppression. Here an action will lie at the suit of the injured party for what has come to be called abuse of process.
...
Unlike malicious prosecution, the gist of this tort lies not in the wrongful procurement of legal process or the wrongful launching of criminal proceedings, but in the misuse of process, no matter how properly obtained, for any purpose other than that which it was designed to serve. (Rest. S 682.) It involves the notion that the proceedings were 'merely a stalking-horse to coerce the defendant in some way entirely outside the ambit of the legal claim upon which the court is asked to adjudicate', (Varawa v. Howard Smith (1911) 13 C.L.R. 35, 91 (Isaacs J.)) and it is therefore immaterial whether the suit thus commenced was founded on reasonable cause or even terminated in favour of the instigator. The improper purpose is the gravamen of liability.
162  There is application here as the defendants misused the criminal law process in furtherance of an escalating personal attack on the plaintiff in the Judicial Review proceeding, which was extraneous to the proper judicial review of the arbitration decision. The defendant Patry sought to gain advantage in the Judicial Review and to punish the plaintiff for what she considered his wrongful conduct as arbitrator. The motivation of the defendant Anderson was her quest to see the plaintiff punished for his failure to support her.
163  The actions of the defendants in providing their statements to police and actively promoting immediate action to be taken were in furtherance of the improper purpose.
Negligence
164  The claim of negligence is raised as an alternative ground for liability in the event of a finding that certain statements or actions of the defendants were not intentional.
165  I have found the relevant actions of the defendants at issue occurred intentionally, that is, with their reasonable certainty as to what the consequences would be, and that those consequences were desired.
166  Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the defendant Patry, a medical doctor, made outrageous and unsupported medical findings as to the plaintiff's psychological make-up which were calculated to discredit him and to encourage the police to charge and arrest him as did occur.
167  I accept the defendant Patry owed the plaintiff a duty of care to avoid making negligent and false accusations of the plaintiff's mental health [Bella v. Young, ]. I also accept she had as a medical doctor a standard of care to the plaintiff higher than a lay person would have [Davidson v. British Columbia  (S.C.)].
168  I have concern however, given the absence of evidence from the persons involved in the charge process, of the singular effect or impact of the defendant Patry's medical opinions, and therefore whether a sufficient causal connection has been shown to the laying of the charge and consequent arrest. I do not, therefore, find liability based on the tort of negligence.
Intentional Infliction of Mental Suffering
169  The elements of the tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering are:
outrageous or flagrant conduct,
an intention to cause some harm of the kind produced
actual harm
[Rahemtulla v. Vanfed Credit Union  (S.C.)].
170  The defendant Patry's conduct in making allegations in her pursuit of the plaintiff personally far beyond the ambit of the judicial review of the arbitration decision, by employing false statements and inaccurate information, can be fairly characterized as flagrant and extreme, particularly when focused on allegations of criminal conduct and enforcing criminal law.
171  The conduct of the defendants in pursuing the continuation of the charges after they were stayed speaks volumes evidencing that they intended charges and arrest of the plaintiff, and were not just seeking some form of a restraining order. That had earlier been sought and denied in the Supreme Court.
172  The defendants were at least intending that the plaintiff be arrested, that he would be humiliated, and that his defence of the judicial review allegations would be impacted. Although they did not intend the prolonged and serious effects that the plaintiff alleges, it is sufficient for the cause of action to be made out.
DAMAGES
173  The plaintiff's life was severely affected by the charges and arrest occasioned by the defendants' unfounded and malicious actions. The plaintiff experienced depression which manifested itself in several forms including suicide ideation, grossly excessive weight gain, and an inability to focus and concentrate adequately to carry on his law practice.
174  The inability of the plaintiff to continue his law practice led to difficulties with the Law Society and closing his office as of December 31, 1995. He was without money to meet the payments on his residence and he lived for a time in his office. He downsized his office and when that closed he lived for a period of time in his car and was forced to accept welfare.
175  His depression fuelled downward spiral was somewhat similar to the earlier period in his life when his employment with the West Coast Savings Credit Union ended and he was unable to find a new job. The plaintiff had historically suffered with some depression prior to the incident of his arrest on September 30, 1995 but it had been substantially controlled through medication in 1989.
176  The plaintiff was befriended by Ms. Parr in the spring of 1996 with whom he then lived and she helped him to regain some stability in his life. He also was treated by Dr. Johnson for his depression and was able to make dozens of applications in a serious effort to obtain employment.
177  The plaintiff finally succeeded in obtaining employment in October 1999 on a temporary basis as a Regional Estates Specialist with Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. The plaintiff found he could not manage the stress from his work very well, and had episodic "crying jags" during meetings.
178  The plaintiff realized he needed to change his occupation as he was unable to function as a lawyer and in 1999 he moved to Alberta and began work as a pipe-fitter and high-rigger. The work is physically strenuous, work sites are remote, weather conditions adverse and living conditions poor. The work, however, is very remunerative and presently the plaintiff earns in the <damage type = "other">$150,000</damage> range annually, which is several times more than his highest years earnings as a lawyer.
179  Although I accept the defendants' actions caused severe depression which created a downward spiral in the plaintiff's life, I am not, on the evidence, persuaded that his private law practice would otherwise have prospered and been financially successful.
180  The plaintiff's employment history has centered more on employment as house counsel rather than private practice. The plaintiff had left his employment with an Indian Band in Merritt in mid 1994 with a lawsuit against his employer remaining extant. He moved to Duncan, a small community, to live with his fiancé Ms. Bones. That relationship ended less than amicably in December 1994, and again the plaintiff commenced litigation. He was asked by the law firm he was employed with in Duncan to leave, and the parting was acrimonious.
181  The plaintiff had also, of course, not had his contract as arbitrator renewed by the Residential Tenancy Branch because of complaints about his "demeanour", as well as the complaints of the defendant Patry. He was also having to endure the unpleasant personal attack of the defendant Patry in the Judicial Review proceeding.
182  I am of the view the plaintiff would likely have closed out his law practice in Duncan and again sought in house counsel employment within months regardless of the September 30, 1995 charges and arrest. In seeking employment again as house counsel the plaintiff may very well have experienced the difficult process of having to make many applications over a significant period of time to find a new opportunity.
183  The loss of income aspect of damages for which the defendants are responsible is therefore tempered. The substantially higher income level the plaintiff has enjoyed since 1999 more than off-sets loss the plaintiff has suffered from the early wind up of his law practice and his loss at being unable to remain in the profession for which he was trained, enjoyed, and that he wished to follow.
184  The actions of the defendants were vindictive and they were tenacious and unrelenting in their effort to maintain the charges their actions precipitated. I find no defence of justification or truth has been shown.
185  I assess the plaintiff's entitlement to damages against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of <damage type = "general">$50,000</damage>.
PUNITIVE DAMAGES
186  The plaintiff seeks punitive damages from the defendants, particularly the defendant Patry. The factors for consideration of punitive damages are succinctly summarized by Mr. Justice Binnie in Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co., ,  at para. 94.
187  Punitive damages may be given when there is misconduct that would otherwise be unpunished or where other penalties are likely to be inadequate to achieve the objectives of retribution, deterrence and denunciation. Punitive damages should be awarded only where compensatory damages, which are in some degree punitive, would not accomplish these objectives.
188  I conclude that an award of punitive damages is appropriate in the case of the defendant Patry to meet the requirement framed by Mr. Justice Binnie as "... (7) to give a defendant his or her just desert (retribution), to deter the defendant and others from similar misconduct in the future (deterrence), and to mark the community's collective condemnation (denunciation) of what has happened".
189  The evidence shows the defendant Patry escalated a complaint of bias against the plaintiff as arbitrator to ultimately having him arrested on a criminal charge as a "stalker", with innuendo from his alleged castration that he was a sex offender, and he was vilified by her, as a medical doctor, in diagnosing him as "... between a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia or paranoid, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder ..." and that in her view (again as a medical doctor) "...he was incompetent as a lawyer; he is manipulative, impulsive, prejudicial and he is psychiatrically unstable". These accusations were untrue and without any appropriate basis for her to be giving medical opinion.
190  I award punitive damages of <damage type = "punitive">$10,000</damage> against the defendant Patry.
191  I consider the defendant Anderson's unfortunate background, continuing mental disability, and her tendency to be easily influenced by others, militates against any need for an award of punitive damages.
CONCLUSION
192  The defendants are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff for damages of <damage type = "general">$50,000</damage>. The defendant Patry is additionally liable for <damage type = "punitive">$10,000</damage> punitive damages.
193  The plaintiff is entitled to the costs of his action.

Action by the plaintiff for damages resulting from a motor vehicle accident. The defendant admitted liability but contested the extent of the plaintiff's injuries and the amount of damages claimed. The accident occurred in May 2006. The plaintiff was a passenger in a vehicle that was struck on the side by the defendant's vehicle. She suffered head, neck and back pain following the accident. The plaintiff claimed that she suffered serious and permanent injuries from the accident including chronic pain in her neck, shoulders and back, headaches, cognitive deficits, and psychological dysfunction. She also claimed to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and a mild traumatic brain injury. The plaintiff was in another motor vehicle accident in June 2011 which aggravated her symptoms from the 2006 accident and caused some regression. 

HELD: Action allowed in part.
 The plaintiff's evidence was vague and contradictory at times, but not deliberately untruthful. Her evidence was approached with some caution, but not discounted entirely. The plaintiff's evidence of her physical, mental and emotional condition was exaggerated. She did suffer from soft tissue injuries to the neck, shoulders and back which reached a plateau within two years of accident. She had unresolved back discomfort, occasional flaring pain and periodic headaches. This had not prevented the plaintiff from resuming vocational or other activities and did not cause a mood disorder or interfere with her cognitive abilities. While the accident did cause post-traumatic stress disorder and a mild traumatic brain injury, these were resolved shortly after the accident. The plaintiff was very athletic and physically active and the injuries, while not severe, had a particular impact on her. She was awarded <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$60,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages to compensate for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of recreational activities. There was some limited loss of housekeeping capacity, but this was subsumed in the non-pecuniary award. Past loss of income and earnings capacity was assessed at <damage type = "past wage loss">$20,000</damage>. There was a real but relatively low possibility that the plaintiff's accident-related symptoms would be permanent which resulted in loss of future earning capacity being valued at <damage type = "future wage loss">$75,000</damage>. Cost of future care for counselling, massage, physiotherapy, pain medication and gym was valued at <damage type = "future care">$10,000</damage>. The evidence for the plaintiff's special damages claim was vague and unreliable and no award was made.

Reasons for Judgment
G. DICKSON J.
INTRODUCTION
1  The plaintiff, Riechelle Hardychuk, claims damages for personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident on May 20, 2006. The defendants admit liability but dispute the nature and extent of Ms. Hardychuk's alleged injuries and the amount of damages claimed.
2  Ms. Hardychuk was a 20-year-old apprentice cabinetmaker employed at a high-end custom woodworking business at the time of the accident. Prior to its occurrence she was in generally good health and led an active, busy lifestyle. Throughout most of her life Ms. Hardychuk functioned well and enjoyed close relationships with family and friends, although in her late teens she suffered a period of depression. She enjoyed school, excelled in many sports and looked forward to a career in cabinetmaking or construction with optimism and pleasure.
3  Ms. Hardychuk contends that, as a result of the accident, she suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck, shoulders and upper back and a mild traumatic brain injury. Thereafter, she says she developed chronic pain in her neck and back, headaches, anxiety and cognitive deficits such as difficulty with memory and concentration. In consequence, although she continued her employment as a cabinetmaker for four years post-accident, Ms. Hardychuk says that by October, 2010 she had to stop work due to the effects of her injuries. She has been unemployed since and says she is permanently partially disabled vocationally, recreationally, and interpersonally. She claims substantial damages for pain and suffering, past and future loss of housekeeping capacity, past and future loss of capacity to earn income, cost of future care and special damages.
4  The defendants accept that Ms. Hardychuk suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and back and a concussion in the accident. They contend, however, that she has seriously exaggerated the extent of her injuries and their effect on her life and future prospects. In particular, the defendants deny that Ms. Hardychuk is physically, mentally or emotionally unable to work as a cabinetmaker as a result of her injuries or that her personal life has deteriorated to nearly the extent she alleges. In so far as her condition continues to be affected negatively by her injuries, they say it should improve with further time and treatment. In sum, they submit Ms. Hardychuk is entitled to a moderate award for non-pecuniary damages and modest, if any, awards under the other heads of damages claimed.
ISSUES
5  The issues for determination are:
What was Ms. Hardychuk's condition before and after the accident, and why?
What is Ms. Hardychuk's future prognosis?
What quantum of damages should be awarded to Ms. Hardychuk?
FACTS
Preliminary Comment on Credibility and Reliability
6  The credibility and reliability of Ms. Hardychuk's account of her condition before and after the accident are key issues for determination. They are also hotly contested by the parties.
7  According to her counsel, Ms. Hardychuk was a sincere witness who described significant post-accident changes in her physical, mental and emotional health and functioning in a believable manner that was supported by the testimony of knowledgeable others. According to defence counsel, much of Ms. Hardychuk's testimony was inconsistent with her prior statements, common sense and the testimony of disinterested third parties. In addition, her subjective complaints of pain are unsupported by objective evidence. In the result, defence counsel says Ms. Hardychuk's account is not credible or reliable and it should not be believed.
8  The factors to be considered when assessing credibility were summarized by Dillon J. in Bradshaw v. Stenner, , as follows:
186 Credibility involves an assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness' testimony based upon the veracity or sincerity of a witness and the accuracy of the evidence that the witness provides (Raymond v. Bosanquet (Township) ,  (S.C.C.)). The art of assessment involves examination of various factors such as the ability and opportunity to observe events, the firmness of his memory, the ability to resist the influence of interest to modify his recollection, whether the witness' evidence harmonizes with independent evidence that has been accepted, whether the witness changes his testimony during direct and cross-examination, whether the witness' testimony seems unreasonable, impossible, or unlikely, whether a witness has a motive to lie, and the demeanour of a witness generally (Wallace v. Davis  (Ont. H.C.); Faryna v. Chorny,  (B.C.C.A.) [Faryna]; R. v. S.(R.D.),  at para. 128 (S.C.C.)). Ultimately, the validity of the evidence depends on whether the evidence is consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole and shown to be in existence at the time (Faryna at para. 356).
9  Where, as here, a plaintiff's case relies on subjective symptoms with little or no objective evidence of continuing injury the court must be exceedingly careful in examining the evidence and assessing credibility: Price v. Kostryba . If deliberate falsehood is established it may be difficult to disentangle truth from deceit and some truthful aspects of the plaintiff's testimony may lose their force, particularly in the absence of corroboration. That being said, when a plaintiff is accused of deliberate deceit more than speculation or innuendo is required. A charge of deliberate deceit under oath is a serious attack on an individual's integrity which should not be lightly treated or lightly made: Halteren v. Wilhelm, ; Edmondson v. Payer, ; Vasiliopoulos v. Dosangh, .
10  The typical starting point in a credibility assessment is to presume truthfulness: Halteren. Truthfulness and reliability are not, however, necessarily the same. A witness may sincerely attempt to be truthful but lack the perceptive, recall or narrative capacity to provide reliable testimony. Alternatively, he or she may unconsciously indulge in the human tendency to reconstruct and distort history in a manner that favours a desired outcome. There is, of course, also the possibility that a witness may choose, consciously and deliberately, to lie out of perceived self-interest or for some other reason. Accordingly, when a witness's evidence is demonstrably inaccurate the challenge from an assessment perspective is to identify the likely reason for the inaccuracy in a cautious, balanced and contextually sensitive way.
11  The presumption of truthfulness will be displaced by convincing evidence of deliberate falsehood. Such evidence may take many forms. There is no hard and fast rule as to how falsehood on a plaintiff's part may be demonstrated in a personal injury action. In my view, however, in most such cases fairness will require that a plaintiff be given an opportunity to respond directly to an assertion of deliberate untruthfulness before his or her credibility, as distinct from reliability, is successfully impeached: R. v. Lyttle, ; Browne v. Dunn (1893), 6 R. 67 (U.K.H.L.).
12  If Ms. Hardychuk's account of her pre and post-accident condition is not convincing then the hypothesis upon which the expert opinions rest will be undermined: Samuel v. Chrysler Credit Canada Ltd., . In consequence, the opinions proffered will have little, if any, evidentiary value. To varying extents, all of the experts who assessed Ms. Hardychuk relied on her to describe or demonstrate her history and condition in a truthful and reliable manner. If she failed to do so, the resulting opinion lacks foundation and is thus not entitled to weight.
13  In this case I have found assessment of Ms. Hardychuk's credibility and reliability to be unusually challenging. As her counsel points out, it is inherently unlikely that she would consciously and deliberately mislead expert assessors or the court on matters she must know could be easily recognised and contradicted. It is also unlikely she would attend upon multiple health care practitioners or quit her job in an effort to build up a personal injury claim. On the other hand, as defence counsel points out Ms. Hardychuk's complaints of pain and disability have improbably increased recently rather than stayed at a plateau or improved and seem inconsistent with much of her earlier post-accident performance. In addition, she has said different things to different people at different times about how she feels and what she can do. She has also showed questionable effort on recent tests administered by experts to measure her mental and physical capacities.
14  As discussed below, I conclude that Ms. Hardychuk's account of her pre and post-accident history and condition is in some respects unreliable. When testifying her memory was often extraordinarily poor, her evidence vague and her prior statements occasionally inconsistent on non-trivial matters. For example, the cause of Ms. Hardychuk's depressed mood is a significant issue for determination. She testified, however, that she did not recall taking medication for depression in 2003, although clinical records reveal that she did and she previously reported having done so to Dr. Schmidt, a neuropsychologist. She was also unable to recall other aspects of her health history and claimed to suffer a current level of disability at odds with her post-accident academic, vocational and recreational activities, as well as with objective testing.
15  In addition, Ms. Hardychuk's demeanour in the witness stand was occasionally argumentative and seemingly directed at making the case rather than responding to questions. For example, when defence counsel asked her to confirm her high marks at B.C.I.T., earned post-accident, she replied at considerable length about how some courses were "incredibly easy" and how frustrating it had been for her to absorb new information. She also volunteered that she probably did well because of her practical experience and familiarity with the materials and equipment.
16  Further, Ms. Hardychuk repeatedly squirmed and changed position when she was testifying in the witness stand. Sometimes she crouched on her knees to alleviate neck and back discomfort associated with prolonged sitting. Although I accept that, as she stated, Ms. Hardychuk found it uncomfortable to sit and testify, her frequent movements had an extreme and rather theatrical quality not apparent when she sat for prolonged periods in other contexts such as lengthy meetings with experts. They detracted from her overall credibility, although only in a minor way.
17  Despite the weaknesses in her testimony and presentation, however, I am not persuaded that Ms. Hardychuk was deliberately untruthful. This proposition was not put to her directly, nor do I think it justified on the evidence. On the contrary, at least for the most part I conclude Ms. Hardychuk has convinced herself that her physical, mental and emotional condition are in the dire state she described and attempted to demonstrate throughout the course of her testimony. Although I do not accept her description as entirely accurate, I find that she has exaggerated in a largely unconscious or, at worst, semi-conscious way. She has also retrospectively over-attributed some of her difficulties to the effects of the accident.
18  All things considered, I approach Ms. Hardychuk's evidence with considerable caution. I do not, however, necessarily discount it, even where uncorroborated, in making the factual findings set out below.
Before the Accident
19  Ms. Hardychuk was born on March 26, 1986. She grew up in North Delta, British Columbia in a close and supportive family. Her father is a fire fighter. Her mother works at Pacific Blue Cross. She has one older brother.
20  Ms. Hardychuk graduated with a grade 12 diploma from North Delta Senior Secondary School in 2004. She was a reasonably good student, although her interests and aptitudes were primarily practical rather than academic in orientation. She was also an excellent athlete who played several sports at a competitive level, including soccer and "Rep A" fast pitch baseball. Recreationally, she engaged in activities such as rollerblading, kickboxing and snowboarding. As she stated in her testimony, sports were, for Ms. Hardychuk, "a part of me, who I was".
21  In addition to the physical benefits of sports, Ms. Hardychuk thoroughly enjoyed the social aspects. Her friends were similarly sport-oriented and they spent much of their time together engaged in sporting activities.
22  Despite her generally good physical health, Ms. Hardychuk experienced a period of depression in 2003 at the age of seventeen. Unfortunately, the precise nature and extent of that experience are difficult to discern on the evidence presented at trial. Ms. Hardychuk testified only to a vague recollection of feeling depressed about a boyfriend and family conflict and denied any recollection whatsoever of having taken antidepressant medication. In contrast, she said she recalled that her mood was negatively impacted by acne medication.
23  Ms. Hardychuk's father, Shawn Hardychuk, and a close high school friend, Joanna Vulcano, were also vague in their recollections regarding her early experience with depression. Her mother and family physician at the time, Dr. Shokeir, did not testify. Dr. Shokeir has since moved to another province and produced her clinical records. Accordingly, I do not draw a negative inference with respect to her non-attendance as a witness.
24  It is less clear why Ms. Hardychuk's mother, Kim Beavan, did not testify, and somewhat troubling. This is particularly so given that Ms. Beavan provided a collateral interview upon which Dr. Schmidt relied in formulating his opinion regarding Ms. Hardychuk's psychological condition. The absence of that aspect of the foundation upon which Dr. Schmidt's opinion is based reduces its evidentiary value. I decline, however, to infer that Ms. Beavan would likely have given unhelpful evidence with respect to Ms. Hardychuk's depressive episode in 2003.
25  I am able to find some facts based on Ms. Hardychuk's vague recollections, her statements to Dr. Schmidt and Dr. Shokeir's clinical records. Dr. Shokeir's records were admitted on the basis outlined by Metzger J. in Seaman v. Crook, , as proof of the fact that the doctor made the recorded observations, prescribed the recorded treatments and the patient made the recorded statements.
26  When Ms. Hardychuk met with Dr. Shokeir in 2003 she was sometimes accompanied by her mother. Unless it is apparent on the face of the records that it was Ms. Hardychuk and not her mother who made a particular recorded statement, I consider such recordings to be potentially inadmissible hearsay and do not take them into account in making my factual findings.
27  In January, 2003 Dr. Shokeir treated Ms. Hardychuk for acne and prescribed a drug known as Acutane. Ms. Hardychuk found that the Acutane made her feel depressed. As a result, she stopped taking it.
28  In May, 2003 Dr. Shokeir saw Ms. Hardychuk in connection with depressed mood and prescribed Celexa, an antidepressant. I am unable to identify the underlying reason(s) for Ms. Hardychuk's depression, although I accept that, as she testified, relationship distress was a contributing factor. There may have been others. Regardless of the cause(s), however, it is plain that Ms. Hardychuk was treated for depression for several months with Celexa. It is also plain that her mood eventually improved in response.
29  As of October, 2003, Ms. Hardychuk was still reporting symptoms such as sadness, irritability, anxiety, crying and angry outbursts. By December, 2003, she stopped taking the antidepressant medication for unexplained reasons I cannot identify.
30  Early in her high school career Ms. Hardychuk took a course in woodworking, which she enjoyed thoroughly. Thereafter, she also took courses such as framing and carpentry. In Grade 12, she participated in a house building project and a practicum program at a cabinetmaking company in Langley. That company, Doug Harris Contracting, offered her an apprenticeship following her graduation from high school.
31  Ms. Hardychuk loved cabinet making, had a knack for it and wished to pursue the trade as a long-term career option. She enjoyed producing "cool things", was careful and detail-oriented, and responded naturally to working with wood. In these circumstances, she sensibly decided to enroll in the cabinetmaking apprenticeship program at B.C.I.T. and accepted the job offer from Doug Harris Contracting.
32  The B.C.I.T. program takes four years to complete and involves both course work and practical experience. The course work is spread over the entire four-year program and separated into four six-week blocks.
33  In June, 2004 Ms. Hardychuk was hit by a car while rollerblading. She suffered scrapes and bruises, soft tissue injuries to her back and a possible left rotator cuff injury. In consequence, she missed a week of work and attended for physiotherapy and massage for several months thereafter. She testified, and I accept, that by the time of the May 20, 2006 accident her injuries from the rollerblading accident had largely resolved and she had resumed all of her previous activities. She had also successfully completed the first block of her B.C.I.T. program with impressively high marks.
34  In December, 2005 Ms. Hardychuk moved from Doug Harris to Hycraft Design Custom Woodworks Ltd.: a high-end woodworking business located on Annacis Island. There she continued with her cabinetmaking apprenticeship. She was the only female employee who worked at Hycraft in this capacity. As a result she was sometimes referred to as "girl", which she tolerated.
35  Ms. Hardychuk's job description at Hycraft was a joiner. Her duties included layout, machine work, assembly and installation of items constructed out of plastic, metal and wood. She worked in the assembly area of the plant.
36  The work environment at Hycraft was competitive, upbeat and generally supportive. Ms. Hardychuk was a valued and capable employee who, for the most part, maintained positive relationships with her work colleagues. These included Rod Dixon, a co-worker, Grant Smith, the foreman, and John Schmidt, Hycraft's owner, all of whom testified at trial.
37  Messrs. Dixon and Schmidt were credible, objective, reliable witnesses. They were both familiar with Ms. Hardychuk's job performance before the accident and able to describe it in clear and balanced terms. I accept their descriptions as accurate and rely upon them.
38  In contrast, Mr. Smith appeared to be defensive about his role in Ms. Hardychuk's departure from Hycraft and to allow his dissatisfaction with her immediate pre-departure performance to colour his overall testimony. He also refused to speak with Ms. Hardychuk's counsel prior to trial. This conduct demonstrated partiality to the defence and detracted from his credibility.
39  Nevertheless, it emerged from the evidence of all three Hycraft witnesses that Ms. Hardychuk showed considerable skill and promise as an apprentice cabinetmaker. It also emerged that before the accident she showed no signs of mental or physical limitation or, in particular, back pain at work. Like all Hycraft employees, Ms. Hardychuk sometimes required assistance with heavy lifting but she had ample physical strength and mental ability to fulfill the job requirements without accommodation. She worked hard, progressed well, and earned the respect and confidence of her co-workers and employer.
40  Although she was reasonably healthy in the year preceding the accident, Dr. Shokeir's records reveal that Ms. Hardychuk complained of breathing problems in late 2005 and early 2006. These problems led to concern that she may be suffering from asthma with a possible anxiety component. When testifying at trial, again Ms. Hardychuk did not recall this aspect of her health history. Nevertheless, the clinical records show that shortly before the accident Dr. Shokeir prescribed a puffer for her ongoing coughing complaints.
41  In sum, before the accident Ms. Hardychuk was in generally good physical and emotional health although she had a history of periodic problems in both areas. Nevertheless, she enjoyed a satisfying social and recreational life, was physically and mentally fit and pursuing a career of interest and aptitude. Her long-term goal was to open a veneer shop of her own, and possibly also to renovate and flip houses. She further planned eventually to marry and raise a family. All of these goals were realistic and well within her reach.
The Accident
42  On May 20, 2006 at approximately 2:00 a.m. Ms. Hardychuk was a seat-belted passenger in the right rear seat of a Ford Explorer driven by the defendant, James McFarlane. Mr. McFarlane was driving her and others home after a social evening out. As he proceeded through the intersection of Scott Road and 72nd Avenue his vehicle was "T-boned" by another, which ran a red light and struck the front passenger side of the McFarlane vehicle.
43  When the impact occurred, Ms. Hardychuk heard metal crunching. Her head hit the side window and she experienced a brief altered state of consciousness. Ms. Hardychuk testified, and I accept, that her recollection of what transpired immediately after the impact is foggy and patchy. For example, she recalls a firefighter holding her neck at the accident scene and aspects of the ambulance ride to the hospital. She was, however, disoriented and faded in and out for several hours thereafter.
44  Ms. Hardychuk was able to provide accurate information regarding her history to emergency personnel who attended upon her at the scene of the accident. According to Dr. Cameron, a neurologist whose evidence I accept, this sort of conduct is not inconsistent with a concussive head injury. Ms. Hardychuk was transported by ambulance to Surrey Memorial Hospital. There she was examined and released to the care of her parents with a prescription for pain medication.
45  The McFarlane vehicle was written off.
After the Accident
46  In the accident's immediate aftermath, Ms. Hardychuk suffered a huge lump on her head and a massive headache. Within a few hours of its occurrence, she also began to suffer sharp pain in her neck that travelled down through her shoulder blades and into her back. She felt dizzy, anxious, stiff and sore all over her body. She slept most of the next day and could hardly move for three weeks. Her sleep was often interrupted by pain and nightmares.
47  On May 23, 2006 Ms. Hardychuk attended at Dr. Shokeir's office. She described the accident and its effects, including neck, shoulder and back pain, headaches, dizziness and short-term memory loss. Dr. Shokeir conducted a physical and mental examination. Amongst other things, she noted the range of motion in Ms. Hardychuk's neck was limited to 50% in all directions. She recorded a diagnosis of mild concussion, whiplash and soft tissue injuries, prescribed Naproxen (an anti-inflammatory), and recommended icing the upper back and physiotherapy.
48  Ms. Hardychuk continued to suffer from neck, shoulder and back pain, frequent headaches and cognitive difficulties such as forgetfulness for several months after the accident. She saw Dr. Shokeir repeatedly regarding these complaints and, on August 17, 2006, underwent a CT of her head. The results were normal. She also attended for regular physiotherapy and massage and followed Dr. Shokeir's advice to stay active. She worked out at the gym regularly and gradually returned to her prior sporting activities, including soccer and baseball.
49  As she reported to Dr. Hershler, a physiatrist, by mid-July, 2006 Ms. Hardychuk felt she was about 70% recovered from her injuries. She had a full range of motion in her head, neck, shoulders and back, but continued to experience periodic headaches and neck and back pain and discomfort. Her sleep also continued to suffer; she felt nervous when driving; and she had occasional nightmares.
50  From mid-July 2006 onward, Ms. Hardychuk took muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatories to help deal with the pain and discomfort caused by her injuries. She also attended for massage and physiotherapy, which provided short-term relief.
51  I find that Ms. Hardychuk's own assessment of her 70% recovery by mid-July, 2006, as reported to Dr. Hershler, was generally accurate. I also find that it represented the early stage of a recovery plateau. As discussed below, I am satisfied that Ms. Hardychuk's soft tissue injury symptoms never fully resolved and she continues to experience back discomfort and occasional flares in pain, as well as occasional headaches. I am also satisfied that the persistence of these symptoms has been frustrating, fatiguing and distressing for Ms. Hardychuk.
52  Although her condition improved marginally over the next two years, by mid-2008 Ms. Hardychuk reached a plateau in her recovery. Her levels of pain and disability have not deteriorated significantly thereafter except in so far as they were otherwise caused.
53  Since reaching her plateau Ms. Hardychuk's day-to-day experience of discomfort, pain and limitation has been variable. In her own words, she has "good days and bad days" dependent in part on her activity level. Heavy lifting at work or prolonged participation in sports leaves her sore and stiff and she tires more easily than she did before the accident. Heavy housework can also be difficult. When she is tired, like most people, she has trouble focusing.
54  Despite the foregoing, Ms. Hardychuk was able to resume the vast majority of her former vocational, social and recreational pursuits within a few months of the accident. To do so, however, she required extra help and more frequent breaks. She also experienced discomfort and occasional flaring back pain. As noted, Ms. Hardychuk suffered some memory loss and other cognitive deficit for several months immediately after the accident. I find, however, that those problems fully resolved.
55  In reaching these conclusions I have considered the entire body of evidence, including Ms. Hardychuk's description of her condition and functioning. Some of that evidence is summarised below. In particular, in addition to Ms. Hardychuk's testimony I have considered her satisfactory performance and progress at work from July, 2006 until shortly before her departure from Hycraft, together with her completion of extra side jobs including construction of her own kitchen cabinets. I have also considered her strong academic post-accident achievement at B.C.I.T., her ongoing participation in travel and sports, and her prior statements to various health care providers and assessors.
56  In addition, I have considered the evidence of Ms. Hardychuk's father, Shawn Hardychuk, her roommate, Joanna Vulcano, and her co-worker, Rod Dixon. All three testified that Ms. Hardychuk's activities, mental acuity and comfort level noticeably reduced after the accident, and never fully returned. Although helpful, these witnesses were quite vague in their recollections and, in the case of Ms. Vulcano and Mr. Dixon, spent limited time with Ms. Hardychuk in the year or two immediately following the accident. As a result, they were better able to provide overall impressions rather than detailed accounts of the change they observed.
57  Further, I have considered the evidence of Messrs. Schmidt and Smith that they were unaware of any serious health problems Ms. Hardychuk might be experiencing in connection with performing her work duties. As noted, given his partiality to the defence Mr. Smith's evidence was of limited value. He did, however, confirm that Ms. Hardychuk sometimes appeared to experience back pain when she was at work. On the other hand, Mr. Schmidt's lack of awareness that Ms. Hardychuk was suffering serious physical or mental problems and his disappointment with her decision to leave Hycraft was far more telling.
58  Like Mr. Smith, Mr. Schmidt knew that Ms. Hardychuk occasionally complained of back pain when working. From his perspective, however, she seemed to be doing pretty well most of the time and he learned of a slip in her performance only shortly before she left Hycraft in October, 2010. If long-standing problems of the nature and magnitude Ms. Hardychuk described actually existed at work one would expect her employer to know about them, investigate and take steps to address the situation. The fact that he did not contributes to my view that Ms. Hardychuk has exaggerated and retrospectively over-attributed some of her difficulties to her injuries.
59  Further, to the extent I found it helpful and reliable I have taken into account the expert evidence in making my factual findings. As discussed below, however, its value is limited by my concerns about the reliability of Ms. Hardychuk's reported history and the extent to which the opinions were founded on those reports. In a few instances, it is also limited by her questionable effort on objective testing.
Post-Accident Medical Treatment
60  Dr. Shokeir closed her practice in the late summer of 2006. Thereafter, Ms. Hardychuk became a patient of Dr. Roy Rampersaud. Her first appointment with Dr. Rampersaud was on September 6, 2006. By the time he testified at trial, Ms. Hardychuk had attended upon Dr. Rampersaud 59 times.
61  Dr. Rampersaud was a strikingly fair and balanced witness. He answered the questions put to him carefully and thoughtfully and maintained an objective stance throughout. In the course of testifying he confirmed that 37 of Ms. Hardychuk's 59 visits included complaints associated with the accident, but of those 27 were also for other reasons and 22 did not involve complaints that were accident-related. Her accident-related complaints related primarily to ongoing neck and back pain which would flare from time to time, as well as headaches. Her range of motion and flexibility in the neck and back area were consistently normal.
62  It is clear that Ms. Hardychuk does not hesitate to seek medical or other attention with respect to her health concerns. On the contrary, she is careful to ensure that she obtains assessment, assistance and treatment whenever such concerns might arise. I intend no criticism in noting this tendency. I remark it, however, because it is inconsistent with the suggestion that Ms. Hardychuk soldiered on stoically for four years and then finally gave up work because she could no longer tolerate the pain.
63  Dr. Rampersaud's records reveal that Ms. Hardychuk's accident-related complaints were treated primarily with anti-inflammatory medication and non-prescription analgesics, together with massage, physiotherapy and other forms of complementary treatment. For example, in January, 2007 he records "going to massage and physioTx" and "pain controlled [with] Advil/Tylenol". In January, 2008, he records "concerned re: ongoing back pain; exercising ... try massage tx - chiropractor". Thereafter, Dr. Rampersaud's clinical records include periodic references to massage, physiotherapy and acupuncture, as well as prescriptions for anti-inflammatory medication and muscle relaxants. Ms. Hardychuk testified, and I accept, that she took these treatments and medications on an as-needed basis. She also testified, and I accept, that she stayed active and exercised as recommended by her treatment providers.
64  Ms. Hardychuk further testified that as time passed and her back pain did not resolve she became concerned that she might need to change careers due to her injuries. From August, 2008 onward she occasionally expressed this concern to Dr. Rampersaud, who noted it in his clinical records. All things considered, I accept that Ms. Hardychuk was genuinely concerned about the possible impact of her back pain on her ability to continue working successfully as a cabinetmaker. I also find that she was consistently able to do so with minor modifications despite her concerns.
65  In September, 2009 Ms. Hardychuk had a flare-up of her back pain. Her range of motion was normal on examination, but she was tender over the upper back and paraspinal muscles. In November, 2009 Dr. Rampersaud referred Ms. Hardychuk to Dr. Chu, a physiatrist. For unknown reasons, she did not attend for an appointment until a second referral was made in July, 2010. Thereafter, she began receiving treatment from Dr. Chu, which treatment apparently includes injections Ms. Hardychuk described as helpful but very painful.
66  Dr. Chu did not testify. In these circumstances, I make no findings in connection with the injections he administers except that Ms. Hardychuk receives them and finds they provide pain relief.
67  Dr. Rampersaud also confirmed that Ms. Hardychuk consulted him regarding many health concerns with no connection to the accident. For example, in the year after its occurrence, amongst other things, she had her tonsils removed and was referred to an infectious diseases specialist regarding a spider bite. Between 2006 and 2011 she also suffered several unrelated injuries. For example, in 2008 she sprained her ankle playing soccer, in 2009 she injured her knee in a fall, and in 2011 she suffered shin splints from running on cement.
68  In January, 2009 Ms. Hardychuk complained to Dr. Rampersaud about low mood, lonely feelings and crying spells. She also reported increased stress and said she had consulted with a counsellor. Surprisingly, she did not inform Dr. Rampersaud that in 2003 she had been successfully treated for depression with Celexa. Nevertheless, Dr. Rampersaud prescribed Celexa and by June, 2009 Ms. Hardychuk's mood had improved considerably. Since then, he has also prescribed another antidepressant known as Pristiq and Ativan for anxiety. He recently referred Ms. Hardychuk to see a psychiatrist.
69  On November 16, 2010 Ms. Hardychuk told Dr. Rampersaud she was laid off of work due to her chronic pain. She made similar statements to other experts, including Dr. Cameron, Dr. Powers, and Mr. McNeil.
Post-Accident Social Life
70  Ms. Hardychuk was living at home with her parents when the accident happened. At the time, she had a boyfriend named Jayce whom she had known since high school. That relationship ended three months after the accident. Jayce did not testify. Although in her testimony Ms. Hardychuk attributed the break-up to the accident, I make no findings as to why the relationship came to an end.
71  Ms. Hardychuk gradually returned to most of her previous social and sporting shortly after the accident. These include, amongst others, soccer, baseball, and snowboarding. Since the accident she has worked out regularly at the gym, as recommended by her treatment providers. She has also travelled to the Philippines and the Bahamas with friends.
72  Ms. Hardychuk testified that she feels nervous and anxious when driving since the accident. I accept this assertion, but find such feelings are fleeting and do not affect her driving or other habits in any way.
73  In the spring of 2007 Ms. Hardychuk moved into a house that she purchased with her parents. They planned to renovate and sell it for profit. Ms. Hardychuk built kitchen cabinets, but did not help with other renovations to the extent and at the pace all concerned had expected. As matters unfolded, she continued to live there and they have earned rental income instead of selling the house. In September, 2009 Ms. Vulcano moved in and became Ms. Hardychuk's roommate.
74  On July 17, 2007 Ms. Hardychuk attended for a follow-up visit with Dr. Hershler. She told him that she had recently moved into the new house and was independent in activities of basic living. She also said that heavy tasks affect her more than they did before the accident. In contrast, however, at trial she testified that she cannot do most housework or yard work because of her back pain. She also testified her mother and Ms. Vulcano do almost all such work. Ms. Vulcano testified to similar effect.
75  I am not persuaded that Ms. Hardychuk is able to perform only very limited housework or yard work. Her statement to Dr. Hershler is inconsistent with this claim. In addition, she was able to work as a cabinetmaker for four years after the accident and managed successfully without a roommate for about two years. Further, Ms. Vulcano's evidence on the point was general and included assumptions about what Ms. Hardychuk's mother did in her absence. Ms. Hardychuk's mother did not testify.
76  On the other hand, I accept that Ms. Hardychuk finds heavy housework more difficult that she did before the accident. As a result, she performs the tasks more slowly and sometimes feels stiff and sore afterwards. I also accept that Ms. Hardychuk's mother helps her out from time to time and Ms. Vulcano does rather more than her fair share around the house.
77  Matt Corrin also testified as a witness. He was involved romantically with Ms. Hardychuk from May to October, 2009 and lived in the house for about a month near the end of their relationship. Mr. Corrin was not acquainted with Ms. Hardychuk before the accident, but knew she had been in one at some point. He also knew that she suffered back pain and discomfort, which he thought contributed to relationship problems involving Ms. Hardychuk's temper, energy and activity level. As with Jayce, Ms. Hardychuk attributed the failure of her relationship with Mr. Corrin to the effects of her injuries.
78  Like Ms. Vulcano, Mr. Corrin's recollections of Ms. Hardychuk's condition and conduct were quite general and impressionistic. Based on his testimony, Ms. Vulcano's and that of Ms. Hardychuk I am satisfied Ms. Hardychuk was often irritable and moody. All things considered, however, I make no findings as to the reasons her relationship with Mr. Corrin failed.
Post-Accident Work Life
79  Ms. Hardychuk missed three weeks of work at Hycraft immediately after the accident. When she returned she performed light duties for a few weeks and was frequently assisted by co-workers. For several months thereafter she found it difficult to read and follow plans because of problems with memory and concentration and headaches. She also found it painful to perform the job's physical demands, which frequently caused her neck, shoulder and back pain to flare. As a result, she often felt irritable and tired at work.
80  Ms. Hardychuk testified that she never returned to performing full duties at Hycraft following the accident. She made similar statements to some of the experts. I do not accept this assertion as accurate. It is inconsistent with her statement to Dr. Herschler that she had been performing regular work since late June, 2006. It is also inconsistent with the testimony of Messrs. Dixon, Schmidt and Smith.
81  I find that Ms. Hardychuk returned to performing the full duties of her job within approximately two months of the accident. This is not to say that her work life was entirely unaffected by her injuries from that point on. It was not. After she reached her recovery plateau, she required more assistance with heavy lifting than she did before the accident. She also took more breaks and suffered intermittent flares of back pain when working. This pattern continued throughout the time she was employed at Hycraft.
82  As Mr. Smith testified, all Hycraft employees occasionally assist one another with heavy lifting. As Mr. Dixon testified, however, Ms. Hardychuk's need for assistance with lifting increased after the accident. In addition, her co-workers occasionally gave her back massages when she complained of pain, which she did every few months, and she took more breaks to maintain her stamina. With these modifications, however, Ms. Hardychuk was able to perform her job well, repeatedly received pay raises and progressed in skills and responsibility.
83  Ms. Hardychuk was also able to complete "side jobs" after regular work hours in the years after the accident. Unfortunately, the evidence on this point was decidedly vague. As a result, I am unable to make detailed findings as to what she did and when except to note that one of her side jobs was construction of kitchen cabinets for the house she owns with her parents. Although I accept that she turned down other possible side jobs I cannot make detailed findings as to how many or when.
84  Ms. Hardychuck was further able successfully to complete the remaining three blocks of her B.C.I.T. coursework after the accident and receive her provincial certification. Her course marks were excellent, although she sometimes became sore and tired after prolonged studying. She did not pass the "Red Seal" exam for cross-Canada certification when she recently attempted to do so. Not surprisingly, she felt disappointed and discouraged as a result.
85  The circumstances surrounding Ms. Hardychuk's departure from Hycraft are contentious. Ms. Hardychuk testified that she left due to her ongoing chronic pain and its negative impact upon her job performance. Defence counsel asserts that she chose to leave for unrelated reasons, perhaps involving a loss of interest in the trade.
86  I conclude that Ms. Hardychuk's attitude, performance and productivity at Hycraft began to slip in the late spring of 2010. I do not accept that she lost interest in cabinetmaking except in so far as she generally lost interest in most activities as part of a depressed mood. I accept that her mood was persistently low and depressed from mid-2009 onward, but am not persuaded this was associated with her soft tissue injury symptoms. I also accept that she found work stressful. This was due in large measure to conflict with her foreman, Mr. Smith.
87  Ms. Hardychuk's physical condition did not change significantly in the spring of 2010. On the contrary, the level of back pain and discomfort she experienced remained essentially as the same as they had been since she reached her recovery plateau.
88  Mr. Smith was aware of the slip in Ms. Hardychuk's job performance. He responded negatively, which contributed to the growing tension and animosity between the two. He also confronted Ms. Hardychuk in an inappropriate manner about a personal relationship and openly criticized her to others. Ms. Hardychuk was understandably distressed and angry. In reaction, she went to Mr. Schmidt on October, 2010 and announced the job was not working out for her. In the course of so doing, she also informed him that she believed her productivity had been slipping.
89  Mr. Schmidt accepted Ms. Hardychuk's statements and laid her off, although he was disappointed by her decision to leave Hycraft. Prior to her announcement in October 2010, he was not concerned about Ms. Hardychuk's job performance. She had not previously expressed such concerns, nor had she sought special accommodations for physical or mental problems in performing her work.
90  Between October 2010 and the trial Ms. Hardychuk was unemployed.
June 29, 2011 Accident
91  On June 29, 2011 Ms. Hardychuk was in another motor vehicle accident. She was a passenger in a vehicle travelling on the highway en route to Penticton. Her friend was driving, veered to avoid a deer and lost control. The car flipped and landed in a field.
92  Ms. Hardychuk testified, and I accept, that she was injured in the June 29, 2011 accident. In its immediate aftermath, her existing condition was seriously aggravated and her symptoms of pain and mental compromise regressed to a similar state to that immediately following the accident of May 20, 2006.
93  I am unable to make any detailed findings regarding the precise nature or extent of Ms. Hardychuk's aggravated condition after the June 29, 2011 accident. This is so because of the paucity and generality of the evidence presented regarding her injuries. As I understand it from her testimony they include a possible concussion.
Expert Evidence
Dr. Rampersaud
94  Ms. Hardychuk's family physician, Dr. Rampersaud, provided expert opinion as well as factual evidence. In his opinion, Ms. Hardychuk suffered from a mild concussion, whiplash and soft tissue injuries to her neck and upper back as a result of the accident. He also opined that in the past few years these injuries developed into a widespread chronic pain syndrome with headaches and psychological effects such as decreased memory, labile mood and anxiety.
95  Dr. Rampersaud went on to opine that it is unlikely Ms. Hardychuk's headaches and back pain will fully resolve in the future. In his view, both will likely affect her recreational activities and she will require assistance with heavy and seasonal household and yard work. He further opined that her injuries will likely affect future employment opportunities as constant moderate to heavy physical work will aggravate her symptoms. In consequence, in his view it is likely Ms. Hardychuk will be unable to pursue cabinetmaking and will need job retraining in a less physically demanding job. It is also likely that she will require intermittent physiotherapy and massage to help her cope with flare-ups of back pain.
96  Dr. Rampersaud's opinion rests largely upon Ms. Hardychuk's reported symptoms and functioning, together with his ongoing examinations. The history included her reports to the effect that she had been on light duties at work since the accident and had limited ability to participate in sports.
97  As noted, Dr. Rampersaud did not know that Ms. Hardychuk was treated for depression in 2003. Although he is familiar with the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder he did not note them in his records or make this diagnosis.
98  In his October 28, 2010 report, Dr. Rampersaud provided helpful general information regarding the likely resolution of soft tissue injuries in most cases. He wrote:
In the majority of people, soft tissue injuries resolve without sequelae in a finite period of time. A review of the medical literature states that 21%-45% of patients with a whiplash type injury will be symptomatic at two years. Another study concluded that "after two years, symptoms did not alter with further passage of time." However, another study did reveal that a small percentage of people did continue to improve after two years (ie., 22% of patients with soft tissue injury of the cervical spine had significant pain at two years, which decreased to 18% at three years and 14% at five years).
Dr. Hershler
99  Dr. Hershler is a physiatrist. He saw Ms. Hardychuk for assessment on July 17, 2006 and July 17, 2007. On both occasions he conducted a physical examination, the results of which were identical. They included findings that: movements of Ms. Hardychuk's lumbar spine were full and normal; head and neck movements were full with respect to range, with palpation eliciting pain in the lower region and the cervical spine and tender points in the upper right trapezius, but otherwise normal; full shoulder movements and neck and shoulder girdle strength was strong; strong handgrips and normal fine motor coordination; normal head and face; normal neurological examination; normal tone, deep tendon reflexes, strength, sensation and coordination; and excellent reflexes in all extremities.
100  Ms. Hardychuk appeared to be anxious when Dr. Hershler assessed her. She complained of ongoing neck, shoulder and back pain and tightness, fatigue, increased moodiness, and difficulty with memory. As noted, in July, 2006 she estimated her recovery level at 70%. In July, 2007 she estimated it at 60%.
101  Based on her reported history and presentation, Dr. Hershler concluded that Ms. Hardychuk sustained musculo-ligamentous injury to her neck with ligament tenderness in the cervical spine and muscle tenderness in the right upper trapezuis. In his view, this is the most likely reason for her persistent neck pain and headaches. He also diagnosed post-traumatic anxiety and post-traumatic concussion resulting in impaired short-term memory, difficulty with immediate recall, and problems with concentration and focus.
102  As of July 17, 2007, Dr. Hershler opined that Ms. Hardychuk's prognosis for recovery was guarded. He thought it unlikely that her symptoms would disappear in the near future and she would likely be symptomatic for a further two years. He recommended that she continue with a regular exercise regimen. He also recommended physiotherapy, massage and psychological counseling for anxiety and stress.
Dr. Cameron
103  Dr. Cameron is a neurologist. He saw Ms. Hardychuk for assessment on August 22, 2006 and April 7, 2011. On both occasions he performed a neurological and a physical examination. In August, 2006 the results of both were entirely normal. For example, on both Ms. Hardychuk showed normal tone, bulk and power in all extremities. In contrast, in April, 2011 although her neurological examination was normal she exhibited decreased range of movement of her neck due to a complaint of pain.
104  Ms. Hardychuk's principle complaints to Dr. Cameron were physical and subjective in nature. In addition to complaints of ongoing neck, shoulder and back pain, she complained of headaches, decreased concentration and memory, irritability and mood swings.
105  Based on her reported history and presentation, Dr. Cameron concluded that Ms. Hardychuk suffered soft tissue injuries and a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in the accident. For several months thereafter she suffered cognitive problems such as decreased concentration, memory and information processing in part due to residual effects of her mild traumatic brain injury and in part due to pain and discomfort associated with her physical injuries and developing psychological problems. In Dr. Cameron's opinion, however, after the first few months post-accident any cognitive problems Ms. Hardychuk experienced were due to chronic pain and emotional dysfunction rather than the traumatic brain injury. In particular, in his view Ms. Hardychuk is probably not suffering with long-term residual cognitive deficits as a result of her mild traumatic brain injury.
106  In explaining his opinion as to why Ms. Hardychuk continues to report cognitive deficits Dr. Cameron noted that depressive symptoms can develop gradually after an injury. When this happens, the injured person may describe the physical pain as increasing rather than decreasing over time. This occurs because the perception of pain is compounded by the depression and it may become challenging to sort out the degree to which psychological factors are a contributing factor. That being said, on cross-examination Dr. Cameron agreed that Ms. Hardychuk's complaints of musculoskeletal pain five years after the accident "raise questions".
Dr. Schmidt
107  Dr. Schmidt is a neuropsychologist. He saw Ms. Hardychuk for assessment on January 10 and 18, 2007 and August 26, 2010. Following those assessments he wrote a report dated May 11, 2007 and a follow-up report dated September 22, 2010.
108  In conducting his initial assessment Dr. Schmidt reviewed the ambulance crew report of May 20, 2006, Dr. Hershler's report of July 17, 2006, and Dr. Cameron's report of October 11, 2006. He also interviewed Ms. Hardychuk and her mother, Kim Beavan, and performed neuropsychological testing. As he remarked in his May 11, 2007 report, Dr. Schmidt was provided access to only limited records. In particular, he did not review any educational or vocational records. In addition, he did not review any medical records from prior to the accident.
109  In conducting his follow-up assessment in August, 2010, Dr. Schmidt interviewed Ms. Hardychuk again and performed further neuropsychological testing. On this occasion he had access to a greater volume of records. Some of them were placed before the court; others were not. Included in the package he reviewed were Dr. Rampersaud's clinical records from September, 2006 to July, 2010 and a report from Dr. Shokeir. Dr. Shokeir's report was not placed before the court at trial. Her clinical records were apparently not provided to Dr. Schmidt.
110  At the initial assessment Ms. Hardychuk told Dr. Schmidt that she took anti-depressant medication when she was 13 years old, but he had no further information on this aspect of her history. As part of the foundation of his report, he assumed that she had no pre-accident psychological problems. Ms. Hardychuk described the accident and her experience of pain and functional limitation thereafter, including complaints of memory, concentration and attention difficulties. She also described the presence of intrusive nightmares, together with ongoing mood and sleep disruption.
111  In 2007 Dr. Schmidt found no evidence of cognitive impairment or deficit on objective testing. His findings in this regard were substantially the same when he conducted the 2010 reassessment.
112  Following the 2007 assessment, taking into account her reported history, together with cognitive and personality testing, Dr. Schmidt concluded that Ms. Hardychuk suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and a mild traumatic brain injury as a result of the accident. He noted the presence of some generalized anxiety, but opined that she did not then show a significant mood disorder. Rather, in Dr. Schmidt's view it appeared that Ms. Hardychuk's post-traumatic stress disorder was "well encapsulated" and had not evolved into more widespread emotional disruption.
113  By the August 2010 reassessment Ms. Hardychuk's presentation had noticeably deteriorated. Although her reported post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms had reduced, she continued to complain of poor memory and concentration, as well as intensified pain, anxiety and depression. Dr. Schmidt administered several neuropsychological tests, none of which revealed any cognitive deficits. On one test, however, three of Ms. Hardychuk's scores were below the cut off, which the test manual provides indicates an underestimation of actual abilities owing to poor effort. On two other tests Ms. Hardychuk's results yielded invalid profiles. On a personality test, Ms. Hardychuk's response pattern was consistent with possible exaggeration.
114  Dr. Schmidt opined that, as of August, 2010, Ms. Hardychuk's difficulties with cognitive functioning were a manifestation of the effects of pain, anxiety and reduced frustration tolerance. He also opined that her low mood likely explained the test results on which she appeared to make a poor effort. He went on to say that since 2007 Ms. Hardychuk's acute symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder had improved, but her general emotional state had deteriorated, with higher levels of depression, anxiety and rumination. He stated further that Ms. Hardychuk's perceptions and coping mechanisms are not optimal and could interfere with her ability effectively to deal with her ongoing pain. He strongly recommended psychological intervention.
115  Dr. Schmidt went on to describe Ms. Hardychuk's prognosis as guarded. In his view, her prospects for improvement are largely dependent on whether she receives and benefits from further treatment interventions in the future.
Dr. Powers
116  Dr. Powers is a vocational rehabilitation consultant. He saw Ms. Hardychuk for assessment on April 26, 2011 and prepared a report dated April 30, 2011 on his findings and opinion.
117  In conducting his assessment Dr. Powers interviewed Ms. Hardychuk and, with an assistant, administered vocational testing. Paragraphs 27 and 28 of the April 30, 2011 report include observations of Ms. Hardychuk made by his assistant, Ms. Eyrl. Ms. Eyrl did not testify. Accordingly, I have disregarded those portions of the report as they constitute inadmissible hearsay.
118  In addition to interviewing Ms. Hardychuk and conducting testing, Dr. Powers reviewed several reports authored by other experts. He did not, however, have access to Ms. Hardychuk's school records and was thus unable to compare her post-accident performance on testing to her pre-accident baseline. That being said, her cognitive and aptitude testing produced scores that were generally within the average or low average range, with a few in the superior range. Her top four interest areas were identified as carpentry, medical service, writing and electronics.
119  As part of the foundation for his opinion, Dr. Powers assumed that Ms. Hardychuk continues to suffer from headaches, anxiety and depression in addition to chronic neck and back pain as a result of her soft tissue injuries. He also assumed that, after the accident, she returned to work as a cabinetmaker on light duties in an accommodated capacity until October 2010. He further assumed that Ms. Hardychuk stopped working as a cabinetmaker because she was physically and cognitively unable to maintain competitive employment.
120  Based on the foregoing assumptions Dr. Powers opined that Ms. Hardychuk is competitively unemployable for the foreseeable future, at least until her medical condition improves substantially. He also opined that she should attend a chronic pain management program, participate in vocational rehabilitation and retrain for less physically demanding work, preferably in a job training rather than formal educational setting.
Mr. McNeil
121  Mr. Russell McNeil is an occupational therapist and certified work capacity evaluator. He saw Ms. Hardychuk on April 28, 2011 for assessment of her work capacity and other functional abilities. Mr. McNeil performed a full day of physical testing, interviewed Ms. Hardychuk and reviewed reports and records of other experts. He prepared a report dated May 15, 2011 setting out his findings, opinion and recommendations for care.
122  Mr. McNeil expressed the view that Ms. Hardychuk showed high levels of effort throughout the testing he administered. Given the results, this view is, at best, surprising. On virtually all of the tests Ms. Hardychuk performed at below average levels for her age and sex; in other words, she demonstrated less strength, less endurance, less ability to sit, less ability to walk, less ability to lift, push, pull and carry than an average woman of her age. On one of the tests she scored at the first percentile. Although Ms. Hardychuk misinformed Mr. McNeil about the extent of her post-accident employment and recreational activities, he knew she was able to work as a cabinetmaker for four years.
123  Mr. NcNeil opined that Ms. Hardychuk did not have the physical strength or stamina to perform her previous work as a cabinetmaker on a full or even part-time basis. Taking into account the many restrictions he identified in her capacity for activity he concluded that her vocational alternatives are extremely limited. He also concluded that Ms. Hardychuk demonstrated many restrictions in her ability to perform tasks involving home and yard maintenance. He went on to recommend a wide range of interventions and supports to assist her functioning in regular activities.
CAUSATION
Legal Framework
124  The plaintiff must establish on a balance of probabilities that the defendant's negligence caused or materially contributed to an injury to justify compensation. The defendant's negligence need not be the sole cause of the injury so long as it is part of the cause beyond the range of de minimus. Causation need not be determined by scientific precision: Athey v. Leonati, .
125  The primary test for causation is the "but-for" test: but for the defendant's negligence would the plaintiff have suffered the injury? In exceptional circumstances (which do not arise in this case), the "material contribution" test may be applied. The "but-for" test recognizes that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for negligent conduct only where there is a substantial connection between the injury in question and the defendant's conduct: Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke, .
126  Causation must be established on a balance of probabilities before the court proceeds to assess damages. As McLachlin, C.J.C. stated in Blackwater v. Plint, :
It is important to distinguish between causation as the source of the loss and the rules of damage assessment in tort. The rules of causation consider generally whether "but for" the defendant's acts, the plaintiff's damages would have been incurred on a balance of probabilities. Even though there may be several tortious and non-tortious causes of injury, so long as the defendant's act is a cause of the plaintiff's damage, the defendant is fully liable for that damage. The rules of damages then consider what the original position of the plaintiff would have been. The governing principle is that the defendant need not put the plaintiff in a better position than his original position and should not compensate the plaintiff for any damages he would have suffered anyway: [Athey] ...
127  The essential purpose of tort law is to place the plaintiff in the position he or she would have occupied but for the defendant's negligence. For this reason the defendant must take the plaintiff as he or she is found, even if the plaintiff's injuries are more severe than they would be for a normal person (the "thin skull rule"). On the other hand, the defendant need not compensate the plaintiff for any debilitating effects of a pre-existing condition which the plaintiff would have experienced in any event (the "crumbling skull rule"): Athey.
128  Where the plaintiff's injuries have multiple causes a question arises as to whether the injuries are divisible or indivisible. Divisible injuries can be separated so that their damages can be assessed independently. In contrast, indivisible injuries cannot be separated: Bradley v. Groves, .
129  If an injury is divisible, the plaintiff can recover from a particular defendant only the damages attributable to the injury caused or contributed to by that defendant. If the injury is indivisible, the plaintiff can recover from the defendant all of the damages attributable to the injury regardless of the contribution made by others. In each case, the determination will depend upon the facts found based on the evidence. In some cases of earlier and later injury in the same region of the body, the injuries may be divisible. In others, it may be impossible for the worsening of an injury to be divided up: Athey; Bradley.
130  Causation is sometimes asserted based primarily on a temporal relationship between the negligent conduct and injury in question. In such cases, close scrutiny of the evidence is required because the inference from a temporal sequence to a causal connection is not always reliable: White v. Stonestreet, .
Psychological Injury
131  Cases involving alleged psychological injuries require particularly close scrutiny of the evidence. As Newbury J.A. remarked in Sandegren v. Hardy , claims of debilitating pain that persists long past the usual recovery period are notoriously difficult for the court to assess.
132  Mr. Justice Lambert summarized the principles to be applied in assessing claims of psychological injury in Yoshikawa v. Yoshikawa and Yu :
It is important to understand what is established and what is not established by the decision in Maslen v. Rubenstein, . I propose to set out a number of principles extracted from the reasons of Mr. Justice Taylor, for the Court, in the Maslen case. The first point is a preliminary point and appears in Maslen at p. 133 under the heading "(a) The Background":
The plaintiff must establish that the pain, discomfort or weakness is "real" in the sense that the victim genuinely experiences it.
The remaining ten points are drawn from the part of the reasons headed "(b) The Basic Principles" at pp. 134 to 137:
The plaintiff must establish that his or her psychological problems have their cause in the defendant's unlawful act.
The plaintiff's psychological problems do not have their cause in the defendant's unlawful act if they arise from a desire on the plaintiff's part for such things as care, sympathy, relaxation or compensation.
The plaintiff's psychological problems do not have their cause in the defendant's unlawful wrongful act if the plaintiff could be expected to overcome them by his or her own inherent resources, or "will-power".
If psychological problems exist, or continue, because the plaintiff for some reason wishes to have them, or does not wish to end, their existence or continuation must be said to have a subjective, or internal, cause. (NOTE: I consider that this proposition must deal with the conscious mind, otherwise it seems to me to beg the question; see my first observation, later in this Part of these reasons.)
If a court could not say whether the plaintiff really desired to be free of the psychological problems, the plaintiff would not have established his or her case on the critical issue of causation.
Any question of mitigation, or failure to mitigate, arises only after causation has been established.
It is not sufficient to ask whether a psychological condition such as "chronic, benign pain syndrome" is "compensable". Such a psychological condition may be compensable or it may not. The identification of the symptoms as "chronic benign pain syndrome" does not resolve the questions of legal liability or the question of assessment of damages.
It is unlikely that medical practitioners can answer, as matters of expert opinion, the ultimate questions on which these cases often turn.
Mr. Justice Spencer, at trial in the Maslen case, put the overall test quite correctly in these words:
[C]hronic benign pain syndrome will attract damages ... where the plaintiff's condition is caused by the defendant and is not something within her control to prevent. If it is true of a chronic benign pain syndrome, then it will be true also of other psychologically-caused suffering where the psychological mechanism, whatever it is, is beyond the plaintiff's power to control and was set in motion by the defendant's fault.
There must be evidence of a "convincing" nature to overcome the improbability that pain will continue, in the absence of objective symptoms, well beyond the recovery period, but the plaintiff's own evidence, if consistent with the surrounding circumstances, may nevertheless suffice for the purpose.
...
I am sure Mr. Justice Taylor did not consider that the "basic" principles which he set out exhausted all the possibilities for the application of principle to the difficult problems in these cases. The general principles which apply in relation to causation in law will apply to psychological injury as they apply to physical injury.
Discussion
133  Ms. Hardychuk submits that she suffered serious and permanent injuries as a result of the accident. These include soft tissue injuries her to neck, shoulders and back leading to chronic pain, frequent headaches, cognitive deficits and psychological dysfunction. She also submits that she suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and a mild traumatic brain injury.
134  According to Ms. Hardychuk the symptoms of her injuries are widespread and seriously debilitating. They include daily back discomfort and pain, frequent headaches, reduced physical strength and stamina, cognitive deficits such as decreased memory and focus, and ongoing depression and anxiety. In her submission, these symptoms are all real in the sense that she genuinely experiences them, cannot overcome them by willpower and does not wish them to continue. But for the accident, she says they would not be present and the damages she has suffered would not have been incurred.
135  Defence counsel responds that Ms. Hardychuk has seriously exaggerated the nature and extent of the symptoms she suffers in connection with her soft tissue injuries. She has also failed to prove that she suffered post-traumatic stress disorder or a mild traumatic brain injury as a result of the accident.
136  I have concluded that Ms. Hardychuk's description of her physical, mental and emotional condition is exaggerated, although she has convinced herself otherwise. The reasons for this conclusion are outlined above and need not be repeated here. Although I accept that Ms. Hardychuk suffers from ongoing symptoms associated with her soft tissue injuries, I do not accept that she genuinely experiences them in the moment as intensely as she described in her testimony or that they are nearly so debilitating as she now claims.
137  In sum, I am satisfied that Ms. Hardychuk suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck, shoulders and back which reached a recovery plateau within two years of the accident, leaving her with residual symptoms of back discomfort, occasional flaring pain and periodic headaches. The persistence of these symptoms has frustrated and sometimes fatigued Ms. Hardychuk, but it has not prevented her from resuming her vocational and other activities. Their persistence also did not trigger or evolve into a mood disorder nor do they interfere with her cognitive capabilities.
138  I accept that Ms. Hardychuk suffers from depression, anxiety and emotional dysfunction. The cause and onset of these conditions is unclear on the evidence presented, however, although they have apparently been notable since early 2009. In particular, I am not persuaded that there is a substantial connection between Ms. Hardychuk's mood disorder symptoms and her accident-related injuries. On the other hand, I am satisfied that she suffered a mild traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the accident, the symptoms of which have long since resolved.
139  As noted, in reaching this conclusion I have considered the entire body of evidence. Taking into account Ms. Hardychuk's vocational, academic and recreational activities and achievements since 2006, as well as the results of objective testing, in my view it best harmonizes with the preponderance of probabilities.
140  The expert evidence was of limited value, given the divergence between some of my factual findings and the assumptions underlying the opinions. For example, to varying degrees all of the experts assumed Ms. Hardychuk was significantly more functionally debilitated in her work and home life than I have found. In addition, none knew the details of her early history with depression, Ms. Hardychuk could not remember much and her mother did not testify to clarify the matter. This evidentiary hole seriously undermined the value of the expert opinions that drew a causal link between Ms. Hardychuk's depression and her accident-related injuries. Further, objecting testing by Dr. Schmidt and Mr. McNeil produced results of questionable validity and incompatibility with her post-accident activities, including her four years of full-time employment as a cabinetmaker.
141  Despite the foregoing, I accept Dr. Cameron's diagnosis of a mild traumatic brain injury. The symptoms Ms. Hardychuk reported at their meeting in August, 2006 generally accord with my factual findings and her experience in the accident is consistent with his conclusion. All things considered, I am satisfied that, as Dr. Cameron opined, the problems with cognition Ms. Hardychuk experienced for the first few months post-accident were attributable to a mild traumatic brain injury. I am also satisfied that, as he further opined, she suffered no long-term residual cognitive deficits as a result.
142  I also accept Dr. Schmidt's 2007 diagnosis of well encapsulated post-traumatic stress disorder. Again, I do so largely on the basis that the facts he assumed in support of the diagnosis generally accord with my findings. As noted, Ms. Hardychuk's symptoms, the most serious of which is nightmares, have reduced significantly since the accident. In addition, her driving and other habits of daily life are unimpaired by this condition.
143  The injuries Ms. Hardychuk suffered in the June 29, 2011 accident are divisible from those suffered in the May 20, 2006 accident. As outlined above, her persistent residual symptoms were well established by the time she was in the subsequent collision. Accordingly, damages can be assessed independently between the two accidents.
144  As to prognosis, I conclude Ms. Hardychuk's ongoing accident-related symptoms will likely improve further with proper treatment, including pain management counselling, physiotherapy and massage. I accept, however, that her symptoms may never fully resolve. In reaching this conclusion I rely to some degree on the opinions of Dr. Rampersaud and Dr. Hershler regarding Ms. Hardychuk's future prognosis. Although the factual foundations of their opinions differ somewhat from my findings, particularly as to her functional limitations, the general information provided and applied with respect to future prognosis is helpful and illuminating.
DAMAGES
Non-Pecuniary Damages
Legal Framework
145  Non-pecuniary damages are awarded to compensate the plaintiff for pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of amenities. The compensation awarded should be fair to all parties. Fairness is measured against awards made in comparable cases, which, though helpful, serve only as a rough guide to appropriate compensation. Each case will depend on its own unique facts: Trites v. Penner, .
146  In Stapley v. Hejslet, , the Court of Appeal outlined the factors for consideration when assessing non-pecuniary damages. The court stated:
The inexhaustive list of common factors cited in Boyd [Boyd v. Harris, ] that influence an award of non-pecuniary damages includes:
age of the plaintiff;
nature of the injury;
severity and duration of pain;
disability;
emotional suffering; and
loss or impairment of life;
I would add the following factors, although they may arguably be subsumed in the above list:
impairment of family, marital and social relationships;
impairment of physical and mental abilities;
loss of lifestyle; and
the plaintiff's stoicism (as a factor that should not, generally speaking, penalize the plaintiff: Giang v. Clayton, ).
147  The assessment of non-pecuniary damages is influenced by the plaintiff's personal experiences in dealing with his or her injuries and their consequences, as well as the plaintiff's ability to articulate that experience. A functional approach should be employed by the court. In so doing, a clear appreciation of the individual plaintiff's loss and need for reasonable solace is the key: Dilello v. Montgomery, ; Dikey v. Samieian, .
Position of the Parties
148  Counsel for Ms. Hardychuk submits the range for non-pecuniary damages established by comparable cases is between <damage type = "other">$170,000</damage> and <damage type = "other">$230,000</damage>. Based on his characterization of her condition, he seeks an award of <damage type = "other">$215,000</damage>.
149  Counsel's submission is based on the assertion that Ms. Hardychuk suffers from debilitating back and neck pain, cognitive impairment and emotional dysfunction associated with widespread chronic pain and a mild traumatic brain injury. It is also based on the position that she cannot work as a cabinetmaker, has limited alternative employment opportunities and is unable to engage in most of her former sporting activities.
150  In support of his submission, counsel for Ms. Hardychuk relies upon the following case authorities: Bransford v. Yilmazcan, ; Sirna v. Smolinski, ; Taraviras v. Lovig, ; Danicek v. Alexander Holburn Beaudin & Lang, ; Cikojevic v. Timm, ; and Bouchard v. Brown Bros. Motor Lease Canada Ltd., .
151  In Bransford, the 26-year-old plaintiff suffered chronic neck and arm pain that were associated with thoracic outlet syndrome. Her condition deteriorated over time and she went from enjoying a healthy, active lifestyle to an unemployed state of near semi-invalidity. On appeal from a jury award that exceeded, and was reduced to, the upper limit, the Court of Appeal awarded <damage type = "other">$225,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages.
152  In Sirna, the 22-year-old plaintiff suffered a mild traumatic brain injury which compromised her attention span, memory, energy level and sense of smell. She also suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and back, a hip injury and ongoing depression. As a result, she could no longer continue her education and career path or participate in prior athletic endeavours. Her relationships were also impacted negatively. The court awarded <damage type = "other">$200,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages (which adjusts to approximately <damage type = "other">$215,000</damage> for inflation).
153  In Taraviras, the 44-year-old plaintiff suffered neck and back injuries that led for six years to severe leg pain and, eventually, spinal decompression treatment. Thereafter, he was left with persistent dull back pain, moderate disability and a devastated previously active sporting life. On appeal from a jury award, the Court of Appeal awarded <damage type = "other">$200,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages.
154  In Danicek, the 32-year-old plaintiff suffered a mild traumatic brain injury, soft tissue injuries, and persistent debilitating headaches. Her life was profoundly affected by these injuries, particularly in connection with her compromised ability to work as a lawyer. The court awarded <damage type = "other">$185,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages.
155  In Cikojevic, the 17-year-old plaintiff suffered soft tissue injuries to her back and neck leading to chronic pain and a mild traumatic brain injury. As a result of her injuries, her likely career path was significantly compromised and she was restricted in her previous abilities and enjoyment with respect to sports. The court awarded <damage type = "other">$160,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages.
156  In Bouchard, the 26-year-old plaintiff suffered soft tissue injuries to his back and neck leading to chronic pain, legal cramps, a sleep disorder, and anxiety. These injuries contributed to the breakdown of his marriage and unemployment. The court awarded <damage type = "other">$160,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages.
157  Counsel for Ms. Hardychuk submits her injuries and their effects are generally comparable to those suffered by the plaintiffs in the above noted cases. He says the most similar case is Sima and seeks a similar award.
158  Defence counsel submits the appropriate award for non-pecuniary damages is <damage type = "other">$40,000</damage>. Her submission is based on her assertion that Ms. Hardychuk's complaints of physical and emotional pain, and their effects on her life, are significantly exaggerated. In so far as her complaints are genuine, she relies on the assertion that Ms. Hardychuk is likely to recover further as time goes by.
159  In support of her submission, defence counsel relies upon Le (Guardian ad litem) v. Milburn, , 1987 CarswellBC 1589 and Schweighardt v. Palamara, .
160  In Le, the 17-year-old plaintiff suffered a concussion, multiple abrasions and a chip fracture through the C5 cervical spine vertebrae. Although she had no permanent organic brain damage, she experienced post-concussion syndrome symptoms such as memory loss, anxiety and irritability in the following year. Her prospects for a full recovery were good. The court awarded <damage type = "other">$25,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages (which adjusts to approximately <damage type = "other">$44,000</damage> for inflation).
161  In Schweighardt, the 34-year-old plaintiff suffered soft tissue injuries to her back, shoulders, neck and hips which led to depression, chronic pain and anxiety. Four years after the accident she was unemployed, but with proper treatment she would be able to return to work. The court awarded <damage type = "other">$40,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages (which adjusts to approximately <damage type = "other">$46,700</damage> for inflation).
Discussion
162  I have found that Ms. Hardychuk suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck, shoulders and back in the accident. After a two-year process of gradual recovery, these injuries left her with residual symptoms of back discomfort, occasional flaring pain and periodic headaches. Ms. Hardychuk also suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and a mild traumatic brain injury as a result of the accident. The symptoms of her post-traumatic stress disorder are well encapsulated, resolving and non-debilitating. The mild traumatic brain injury caused Ms. Hardychuk to suffer cognitive deficits for several months but those symptoms have now fully resolved.
163  As a result of her ongoing soft tissue injury symptoms Ms. Hardychuk experiences pain, frustration, and fatigue, but not a mood disorder or cognitive deficits. Her vocational, home and recreational activities have been somewhat modified, but she has not been rendered sedentary or unemployable. As discussed below, her decision to leave her cabinetmaking job in 2010 is not causally related to the accident, nor is her state of depression. The prognosis for further improvement in her ongoing accident-related symptoms is good, but she may never recover fully.
164  Before the accident, Ms. Hardychuk was an extraordinarily athletic and physically-oriented young woman. Vigorous, enthusiastic, unimpeded physical activity in her work and recreational pursuits was, for her, a major pleasure in life. For this reason the compromise to her physical state and activities caused by her ongoing symptoms, while not highly debilitating, represents an unusually significant loss for which she is entitled to be fully compensated. That being said, her loss is not nearly of the nature or magnitude of those addressed in the cases cited by her counsel. It is, however, somewhat greater than those addressed in the cases cited by counsel for the defence.
165  All things considered, I conclude that an award of <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$60,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.
Loss of Housekeeping Capacity
Legal Framework
166  Housekeeping services have economic value. The loss or impairment of a plaintiff's capacity to perform them is, therefore, compensable: Harrington v. Sangha, .
167  The governing principles that apply to awards for the loss or impairment of housekeeping capacity were summarised by Newbury J.A. in Dykeman v. Porohowski, . As noted by Dardi J. in X. v. Y., :
246 ... She affirmed that damages for the loss of housekeeping capacity may be awarded even though the plaintiff has not incurred any expense because housekeeping services were gratuitously replaced by a family member. Recovery may be allowed for both the future loss of ability to perform household tasks as well as for the loss of such abilities prior to trial. The amount of compensation awarded must be commensurate with the plaintiff's loss: Dykeman at para. 29.
168  When housekeeping services have been provided by other household members a claim for compensation must be scrutinised carefully. Although grievous injury need not be established, the court should ask whether the services went above and beyond the ordinary give and take to be expected in a home and were required by the plaintiff's injuries or would have been performed in any event. A relatively minor adjustment of duties within a household will not justify a discrete award under this head of damages: Dykeman, Campbell v. Banman, .
Position of the Parties
169  Counsel for Ms. Hardychuk submits this is a case in which the loss of housekeeping capacity is significant enough to warrant a separate and substantial award under this head of damages. He seeks an award for past and future loss of housekeeping capacity in the range of <damage type = "other">$220,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$325,000</damage>.
170  Counsel's submission is based on his assertion that Ms. Hardychuk cannot perform most household chores due to her ongoing back pain. It is also based on the position that her loss of housekeeping capacity is unlikely ever to change. He further asserts that Ms. Hardychuk will likely experience significant difficulties in the future with child care due to her injuries. Accordingly, he seeks additional compensation for the extra assistance that he says will be required during the child-rearing years.
171  Mr. McNeil opined that Ms. Hardychuk will likely need two hours of housekeeping assistance every week for heavy household duties, at an annual cost of <damage type = "other">$2,262</damage>. In addition, in his view she will likely need four hours of yard work and home maintenance every week for 30 weeks of the year, at an annual cost of <damage type = "other">$3,474</damage>. Counsel for Ms. Hardychuk relies on this evidence in support of his submission. He also points to an award of <damage type = "other">$195,000</damage> made to the 45-year-old plaintiff in Harrington and submits a larger award is appropriate in this case given the plaintiff's relative youth.
172  Defence counsel submits that no award should be made for loss of housekeeping capacity. Her submission is based on the assertion that Ms. Hardychuk's ability to perform household chores is not compromised to the extent that a separate award for impairment of housekeeping capacity is justified. In particular, even if she has found housework more difficult and time consuming since the accident, defence counsel submits that, as in Travis v. Kwon, , any such loss is appropriately addressed within the non-pecuniary damages award.
Discussion
173  I have found that Ms. Hardychuk finds heavy housework more difficult than she did before the accident. In consequence, she performs tasks more slowly than she did before and is sometimes left feeling stiff and sore. I have not found, however, that her capacity to perform housework is compromised to nearly the extent she claimed or Mr. McNeil assumed based on her reports and unreliable testing presentation. For that reason, Mr. NcNeil's opinion on this matter is of little, if any, evidentiary value.
174  Although Ms. Hardychuk's mother has sometimes helped her with housework since the accident and Ms. Vulcano does rather more than her fair share around the house, these are relatively minor adjustments of household duties. In my view, they do not justify a discrete award under this head of damages. Rather, I have taken the impact of Ms. Hardychuk's injuries on her housekeeping capacity into account in the non-pecuniary damages award.
Past Loss of Earning Capacity
Legal Framework
175  An award of damages for loss of earning capacity, whether in the past or the future, represents compensation for a pecuniary loss. The goal is to restore the plaintiff to the position he or she would have occupied but for the defendant's negligence. Accordingly, compensation for past loss of earning capacity is to be based on what the plaintiff would have, not could have, earned but for the accident-related injuries: Rowe v. Bobell Express Ltd., ; M.B. v. British Columbia, ; Gregory v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, .
176  Pursuant to s. 98 of the Insurance (Vehicle) Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 231, a plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for only his or her past net income loss. In the ordinary course this means the court must deduct the amount of income tax payable from lost gross earnings: Hudniuk v. Warkentin .
177  The burden of proof of actual past events is a balance of probabilities. An assessment of loss of both past and future earning capacity, however, involves consideration of hypothetical, not actual, events. The plaintiff is not required to prove hypothetical events on a balance of probabilities. Rather, the future or hypothetical possibility will be taken into consideration as long as it is a real and substantial possibility and not mere speculation: Athey; Falati v. Smith, ; aff'd .
178  As with the loss of future earning capacity, the court's task is to assess damages for past loss of capacity rather than to calculate them mathematically. Allowances for contingencies should be made and the award must be fair and reasonable taking into account all of the circumstances: Falati.
Position of the Parties
179  Counsel for Ms. Hardychuk seeks an award of <damage type = "other">$60,000</damage> in connection with the past wage loss component of this head of damages. In support of this submission he says Ms. Hardychuk lost three weeks of wages immediately after the accident, with a gross loss of <damage type = "other">$1,800</damage>. He goes on to say she also lost at least one week of wages every year until October 22, 2010 to attend accident-related medical appointments and 43 weeks of regular full-time work thereafter, with a total gross wage loss of <damage type = "other">$40,960</damage>. In addition, he says she would probably have earned approximately <damage type = "other">$2</damage> more per hour at Hycraft but for the accident and her associated limitations, leading to a further loss of <damage type = "other">$19,280</damage> in gross wages. He acknowledges the past loss figure on this aspect of the analysis should be adjusted to reflect income tax deductions.
180  Counsel for Ms. Hardychuk also seeks an award of between <damage type = "other">$50,000</damage> and <damage type = "other">$100,000</damage> for past loss of earning capacity in connection with the loss of overtime and independent business opportunities. In his submission, the evidence establishes a real and substantial possibility that Ms. Hardychuk would have earned extra income from side jobs and renovating and flipping houses.
181  Counsel concedes that it would be difficult to estimate the profit Ms. Hardychuk might have earned from home renovations. He says, however, that at a minimum she would likely have put in 8-16 hours of labour per week beyond her regular work with Hycraft. On this analysis, calculated at a rate of <damage type = "other">$23</damage> per hour, he asserts that her additional loss over five years would be in the <damage type = "other">$100,000</damage> range.
182  Taking into account the foregoing, counsel for Ms. Hardychuk seeks an award of between <damage type = "other">$110,000</damage> and <damage type = "other">$160,000</damage> for past wage loss and past loss of capacity to earn.
183  Defence counsel responds that Ms. Hardychuk is entitled to an award for no more than the three weeks of lost wages from Hycraft that immediately followed the accident. In support of this position, she submits that Ms. Hardychuk has failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that she sustained any additional past wage loss after she returned to work. She emphasizes there is no evidence as to how much work may have been missed as a result of Ms. Hardychuk's attendance for medical treatments. She also notes that Ms. Hardychuk was able to work after regular employment hours constructing her own kitchen cabinets and performing side jobs. In these circumstances, she says the award for past loss of earning capacity award should not exceed <damage type = "other">$1,800</damage>.
Discussion
184  I have found that Ms. Hardychuk missed three weeks of work at Hycraft immediately after the accident. When she returned she performed light duties for a few weeks and then resumed the full duties of her job. There is no reliable evidence regarding the extent, if any, to which she lost wages due to attendances for medical appointments. There is also no reliable evidence that she lost pay increases due to her soft tissue injury symptoms and associated work compromise. On the contrary, Ms. Hardychuk repeatedly received pay increases while she worked at Hycraft and progressed well in both skills and responsibility.
185  Despite the foregoing, I have also found that due to her soft tissue injuries Ms. Hardychuk required more assistance with heavy lifting at work than she did before the accident. She also took more breaks to maintain her stamina. Further, from time to time she complained of back pain and received massages from her co-workers. She was also more fatigued by work as a result of her residual back discomfort, headaches and occasionally flaring pain.
186  Significantly for purposes of this analysis, I am not persuaded that Ms. Hardychuk left her cabinetmaking job at Hycraft due to the effects of her accident-related injuries. Rather, she left because she was dissatisfied with the work environment and her productivity had been slipping since early 2010 for unrelated reasons. Those reasons no doubt include the impact of her depression on her overall attitude, focus and productivity, but that condition has not been reliably connected causally to the accident on the evidence presented. In these circumstances, she is not entitled to an award for lost wages since leaving her job at Hycraft.
187  I am also not persuaded that Ms. Hardychuk is disabled from working full-time as a cabinetmaker due to her accident-related injuries. On the contrary, she is demonstrably able to do so if she receives accommodations such as extra help with heavy lifting and extra breaks to maintain her stamina. Those accommodations were available to her at Hycraft without her employer even knowing that she needed them or learning she had a significant health problem. That being so, it is clear only minor accommodations are required for Ms. Hardychuk to work full-time in the cabinetmaking trade.
188  Nevertheless, I am persuaded there is a real and substantial possibility Ms. Hardychuk would have earned extra income by completing additional side jobs but for the accident. Her residual soft tissue injury symptoms caused fatigue, stiffness, and frustration, all of which slowed her down in connection with physical activity. Before the accident, Ms. Hardychuk was an unusually energetic, strong and hard-working young woman. Given those attributes, I am satisfied that but for the accident she would very likely have taken on more side jobs than she did to supplement her Hycraft income. She is entitled to an award to restore this aspect of her original position.
189  Although precision is impossible, particularly given the vagueness of the evidence regarding side jobs, I estimate Ms. Hardychuk would probably have earned something in the range of <damage type = "other">$3,600</damage> to <damage type = "other">$4,000</damage> in extra side job income each year had she not been suffering from the symptoms of her soft tissue injuries. These figures are based on an assumed additional 180 to 200 hours of labour per year remunerated at <damage type = "other">$20</damage> per hour.
190  My task is to assess, not calculate, the value of Ms. Hardychuk's past loss of earning capacity allowing for contingencies and aiming for overall fairness. In my view the positive and negative contingencies cancel one another out. For example, it is possible that after May, 2006 Ms. Hardychuk would have devoted most of her after-hours time and energy to her sporting activities rather than to earning extra income through side jobs. It is equally possible that she would have put in more additional hours working side jobs than I have assumed.
191  All things considered, including the need to compensate Ms. Hardychuk for the three weeks of wage loss suffered immediately after the accident, I assess her past loss of income and income earning capacity at <damage type = "past wage loss">$20,000</damage>.
Loss of Future Earning Capacity
Legal Framework
192  A claim for loss of future earning capacity raises two key questions: 1) has the plaintiff's earning capacity been impaired by his or her injuries; and, if so 2) what compensation should be awarded for the resulting financial harm that will accrue over time? The assessment of loss must be based on the evidence, and not an application of a purely mathematical calculation. The appropriate means of assessment will vary from case to case: Brown v. Golaiy ; Pallos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia ; Pett v. Pett, .
193  The assessment of damages is a matter of judgment, not calculation: Rosvold v. Dunlop, .
194  Insofar as is possible, the plaintiff should be put in the position he or she would have been in, from a work life perspective, but for the injuries caused by the defendant's negligence. Ongoing symptoms alone do not mandate an award for loss of earning capacity. Rather, the essential task of the Court is to compare the likely future of the plaintiff's working life if the accident had not happened with the plaintiff's likely future working life after its occurrence: Lines v. W & D Logging Co. Ltd., ; Moore v. Cabral et. al., ; Gregory v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia, .
195  There are two possible approaches to assessment of loss of future earning capacity: the "earnings approach" from Pallos; and the "capital asset approach" in Brown. Both approaches are correct and will be more or less appropriate depending on whether the loss in question can be quantified in a measurable way: Perren v. Lalari, .
196  The earnings approach involves a form of math-oriented methodology such as i) postulating a minimum annual income loss for the plaintiff's remaining years of work, multiplying the annual projected loss by the number of remaining years and calculating a present value or ii) awarding the plaintiff's entire annual income for a year or two: Pallos; Gilbert v. Bottle, .
197  The capital asset approach involves considering factors such as i) whether the plaintiff has been rendered less capable overall of earning income from all types of employment; ii) is less marketable or attractive as a potential employee; iii) has lost the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities that might otherwise have been open; and iv) is less valuable to herself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour market: Brown; Gilbert.
198  The principles that apply in assessing loss of future earning capacity were summarized by Low J.A. in Reilly v. Lynn, :
101 The relevant principles may be briefly summarized. The standard of proof in relation to future events is simple probability, not the balance of probabilities, and hypothetical events are to be given weight according to their relative likelihood: Athey v. Leonati,  at para. 27. A plaintiff is entitled to compensation for real and substantial possibilities of loss, which are to be quantified by estimating the chance of the loss occurring: Athey v. Leonati, supra, at para. 27, Steenblok v. Funk  at 135 (C.A.). The valuation of the loss of earning capacity may involve a comparison of what the plaintiff would probably have earned but for the accident with what he will probably earn in his injured condition: Milina v. Bartsch  at 93 (S.C.). However, that is not the end of the inquiry; the overall fairness and reasonableness of the award must be considered: Rosvold v. Dunlop,  at para. 11; Ryder v. Paquette,  (C.A.). Moreover, the task of the Court is to assess the losses, not to calculate them mathematically: Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate  (C.A.). Finally, since the course of future events is unknown, allowance must be made for the contingency that the assumptions upon which the award is based may prove to be wrong: Milina v. Bartsch, supra, at 79 ...
Position of the Parties
199  Counsel for Ms. Hardychuk seeks an award of <damage type = "other">$1,000,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$1,500,000</damage> for her loss of future earning capacity. In his submission, on either an earnings or capital asset approach her future loss is of this magnitude given her youth, well established pre-accident career path, the effect of her injuries on that path and her compromised physical and emotional state.
200  Counsel's submission is based on his assertion that Ms. Hardychuk has completely lost her capacity to work in the construction industry. If she does work again he says it will likely be in a minimum wage job and probably limited to part-time. Had she continued employment as a full-time cabinetmaker, however, there is a real and substantial possibility she would have become a foreman by age 35 and consistently earned a solid middle class income. There is also a lesser, but real, possibility she would have earned considerably more as a renovation entrepreneur.
201  Applying an earnings approach counsel submits that, but for the accident, Ms. Hardychuk would likely have earned something in the range of <damage type = "other">$2,289,000</damage> in regular wages over the course of her working lifetime. As a result of the accident, however, he says she is likely to earn only something in the range of <damage type = "other">$616,000</damage>. The difference is approximately <damage type = "other">$1,666,000</damage>, for an average annual wage loss in the range of <damage type = "other">$41,659</damage>. When this figure is discounted by 2.5% for present value he says her lifetime net wage earning capacity loss is <damage type = "other">$1,045,762</damage>. He also says she would have earned at least an additional <damage type = "other">$200,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$400,000</damage> in other project work.
202  Counsel goes on to say that a capital asset approach to assessment produces a similar value for Ms. Hardychuk's diminished future earning capacity. In advancing this submission, he says she is now significantly less capable of performing most types of employment due to her chronic back and neck pain, as well as her associated cognitive, memory and emotional compromise. She is also less attractive as a potential employee due to her permanent partial disabilities; has lost the ability to take advantage of otherwise available job opportunities such as cabinetmaking and home renovations; and is less valuable to herself as a skilled and capable income earner.
203  Defence counsel responds that Ms. Hardychuk is not entitled to any award for loss of future earning capacity. In support of this submission she emphasises that Ms. Hardychuk was able to work in a competitive environment for four years after the accident. At the same time she studied for and passed three apprenticeship levels at B.C.I.T., played various sports, built her own kitchen cabinets and performed some side jobs. Further, she left her job at Hycraft for reasons unrelated to the effects of her soft tissue injuries.
204  Defence counsel goes on to say that Ms. Hardychuk is likely to continue her recovery in the future with appropriate treatment. All things considered, if the court is satisfied Ms. Hardychuk's future earning capacity has been impaired she submits the award should be no greater than a single year's salary.
Discussion
205  Most of the facts relevant to analysis of Ms. Hardychuk's loss of future earning capacity are outlined in the preceding section. Accordingly, there is no need to repeat them. In summary, I have concluded Ms. Hardychuk has not lost her capacity to work as a full-time cabinetmaker due to her accident-related injuries. There is a real and substantial possibility, however, that since the accident she would have taken on more side jobs had it not occurred. I also conclude this likelihood would have continued into the future. I further conclude that the prospect she will open her own veneer shop has been modestly reduced.
206  This is not a case in which the loss of future earning capacity can be easily measured and quantified. Ms. Hardychuk was in the very early stages of her cabinetmaking career when the accident happened and a clear pattern of overall income-earning had not yet emerged. Accordingly, I prefer the capital asset approach to assessment of her loss.
207  Applying the capital asset approach I find that Ms. Hardychuk has been rendered less capable of earning income through side jobs and self-employment by virtue of her reduced energy and physicality associated with her soft tissue injuries. She is also less attractive as a potential employee given her need for minor accommodations at work; has the lost the ability to take advantage of opportunities that might otherwise have been open; and is less valuable to herself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive construction market.
208  Despite the foregoing, Ms. Hardychuk's future prognosis is reasonably positive. With proper treatment, such as pain management counselling, physiotherapy and massage, her accident-related symptoms will likely continue to improve. That being said, there is also a real possibility that her symptoms may never resolve fully and the associated compromise to her earning capacity may be permanent. This possibility is real, but relatively low. Other contingencies, such as the risk that unrelated impediments to future income-earning such as debilitating depression would have reduced her capacity regardless are offset by the equally likely possibility that, with greater physical stamina, she would have earned substantial profits by renovating and flipping properties.
209  All things considered, I conclude an appropriate award for Ms. Hardychuk's loss of future earning capacity is <damage type = "future wage loss">$75,000</damage>.
Costs of Future Care
Legal Framework
210  The plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the cost of future care based on what is reasonably necessary to restore him or her to the pre-accident condition in so far as that is possible. When full restoration cannot be achieved, the court must strive to assure full compensation through the provision of adequate future care. The future care award is to be based on what is reasonably necessary on the medical evidence to preserve and promote the plaintiff's mental and physical health: Milina v. Bartsch  (S.C.); Williams (Guardian ad litem of) v. Low,  (S.C.); Spehar (Guardian ad litem of) v. Beazley,  (S.C.).
211  The test for determining the appropriate award for the cost of future care is an objective one based on medical evidence. For an award of future care: (1) there must be a medical justification for claims for cost of future care; and (2) the claims must be reasonable: Milina.
212  Future care costs must be justified both because they are medically necessary and they are likely to be incurred by the plaintiff. The award of damages is thus a matter of prediction as to what will happen in future. If a plaintiff has not used a particular item or service in the past it may be inappropriate to include its cost in a future care award: Izony v. Weidlich, .
213  The extent, if any, to which a future care costs award should be adjusted for contingencies depends on the specific care needs of the plaintiff. In some cases negative contingencies are offset by positive contingencies and, therefore, a contingency adjustment is not required. In other cases, however, the award is reduced based on the prospect of improvement in the plaintiff's condition or increased based on the prospect that additional care will be required. Each case falls to be determined on its particular facts: Gilbert.
214  An assessment of damages for cost of future care is not a precise accounting exercise: Krangle (Guardian ad litem of) v. Brisco, .
Position of the Parties
215  Counsel for Ms. Hardychuk seeks an award in the range of <damage type = "other">$600,000</damage>. Counsel's submission is based on his assertion that Ms. Hardychuk requires psychological intervention, pain management modalities and job retraining to provide relief and restore her, in so far as is possible, to her pre-accident state. He relies heavily on the evidence of Dr. Powers and Mr. McNeil in this regard.
216  Defence counsel responds that Ms. Hardychuk does not require the multitude of future care benefits recommended by Mr. McNeil in his report and testimony. In support of this submission she emphasises that none of Ms. Hardychuk's physicians have found a restricted range of motion in her neck, shoulders or back and she worked successfully as a cabinetmaker after the accident for four years. She also says that Ms. Hardychuk has not always followed the advice of her treatment providers, particularly with respect to taking anti-depressant medication. In these circumstances, she submits no award should be made under this head of damages.
Discussion
217  I have concluded that Ms. Hardychuk's ability to work as a full-time cabinetmaker has not been lost due to the accident. That being so, she does not require job retraining to restore her to her pre-accident state. She also does not require the multitude of devices and services Mr. McNeil recommended based on flawed assumptions regarding the nature and extent of her disabilities.
218  I accept, however, that, as Dr. Schmidt opined, Ms. Hardychuk's perceptions and coping mechanisms are not optimal and could interfere with her ability to deal with her residual soft tissue injury symptoms effectively. Accordingly, I conclude that she requires psychological counselling for pain management. She does not, however, require a residential program in this regard. I also accept that, as Dr. Rampersaud and Dr. Hershler opined, she will likely require intermittent physiotherapy and massage to help her cope with flare-ups of back pain. In addition, she will periodically require analgesics and muscle relaxants, as well as ongoing access to a gym. All of these future care items are medically necessary and likely to be incurred by Ms. Hardychuk.
219  Taking into account the likely costs of the foregoing, as outlined by Mr. McNeil, and considering the likelihood that Ms. Hardychuk's condition will improve over time I assess the cost of future care at <damage type = "future care">$10,000</damage>.
Special Damages
Legal Framework
220  An injured person is entitled to recover the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a result of an accident. This is grounded in the fundamental governing principle that an injured person is to be restored to the position he or she would have been in had the accident not occurred: X.; Milina.
Position of the Parties
221  Counsel for Ms. Hardychuk seeks an award of <damage type = "other">$3,069</damage> for out-of-pocket expenses said to be incurred in connection with her accident-related injuries. In his submission, Ms. Hardychuk's testimony, together with that of her father, establishes her entitlement to such an award. The expenses claimed concern prescriptions for medication, massage therapy and physiotherapy.
222  Defence counsel responds that the evidence does not establish any entitlement under this head of damages. In particular, Mr. Hardychuk was unable to say whether various medical expenses, including massage and drug expenses, submitted to Sun Life were connected with the accident or whether reimbursement is required. In addition, and in any event, she notes Ms. Hardychuk had extended health coverage through Hycraft until October 2010 and, therefore, was generally reimbursed.
Discussion
223  The burden of proof is on a plaintiff to establish entitlement to an award for damages. In this case, Ms. Hardychuk's evidence as to out-of-pocket expenses was extremely vague and unreliable. For example, some of the prescriptions that were included in the special damages list are for antibiotics and plainly do not relate to the accident. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied she has discharged the burden of proof and find no entitlement has been established under this head of damages.
SUMMARY
224  In summary, damages are awarded as follows:
1.  Non-pecuniary damages <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$ 60,000</damage> 
2.  Past Loss of Income/ <damage type = "past wage loss">20,000</damage> 
  Earning Capacity  
3.  Future Loss of <damage type = "future wage loss">75,000</damage> 
  Earning Capacity  
4.  Cost of Future Care <damage type = "future care">10,000</damage> 
 TOTAL <damage type = "total">$165,000</damage> 
COSTS
225  If the parties are unable to agree on costs, they may speak to the issue.

Action by the plaintiff for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident. Both liability and quantum were at issue. The plaintiff was travelling in the right hand lane and proceeding through the intersection. The plaintiff testified that the defendant appeared suddenly in front of her and she attempted to brake and swerve to avoid the defendant's vehicle. The plaintiff's vehicle hit construction scaffolding and crashed head on into a lamp standard with considerable force. The defendant testified that she was creeping into the intersection to make a left turn and was waved ahead by drivers in the other two lanes. The defendant argued that the plaintiff must have been travelling at an extremely high speed because she suddenly appeared in front of the defendant. Witnesses recalled the plaintiff swerving to avoid the defendant. The plaintiff was 32 years old and in good health at the time of the accident. The plaintiff suffered a broken sternum and injuries to her forehead, neck, chest, abdomen and right leg and knee. She was completely immobile for the first week and her husband had to miss one week of work to care for her. The plaintiff missed seven weeks of work. The plaintiff later found a better paying job but had to resign because it involved driving, which was too painful due to her injuries. The plaintiff continued to attend acupuncture, massage and chiropractic treatments. It had been three years since the accident and her injuries had mostly been resolved and she was expected to fully recover in one year. The plaintiff sought <damage type = "other">$123,992</damage> in damages. 

HELD: Action allowed in part.
 The defendant was entirely liable for the accident. The defendant's recollection was clearly flawed as she recalled the plaintiff hitting a pole in the right hand lane that was not there. The defendant was inconsistent on the important detail of whether or not she could see into the plaintiff's lane before she moved further into the intersection. The plaintiff had the right of way and it was clear the defendant moved forward despite having an obstructed view, otherwise she would have seen the plaintiff approaching and stopped. The plaintiff was travelling at a reasonable rate of speed. The plaintiff suffered pain for three years but was expected to fully recover. She was awarded <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$60,000</damage> for non-pecuniary damages but this was reduced by <damage type = "reduction by">$1,000</damage> for her failure to undergo dental treatment immediately. The plaintiff's <damage type = "special">$6,705</damage> special damages claim was reasonable and accepted. She was not awarded anything for future costs of care given her good recovery prognosis. The plaintiff was awarded a total of <damage type = "past wage loss">$11,206</damage> for past loss of income. This was for the seven-week period following the accident and the time after her resignation, which was required because of her injuries. The job the plaintiff resigned from was better paying than her current job so she was awarded <damage type = "future wage loss">$20,000</damage> for future loss of income. The husband was awarded <damage type = "in trust">$1,800</damage> for business and income lost during his week at home caring for the plaintiff.

Reasons for Judgment
F.E. VERHOEVEN J.
Introduction
1  The plaintiff Monika Najdychor claims damages arising out of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on Tuesday, June 13, 2006 at the intersection of 8th Avenue and Cambie Street in Vancouver. Both liability and quantum are in issue.
The Accident
2  At the date of the accident, Ms. Najdychor was 32 years of age. She was employed as a retail operations manager at the offices of her employer in Yaletown, in downtown Vancouver.
3  On the day of the accident, she left work intending to drive to her home in Ladner. At about 5:10 p.m., she was proceeding southbound on Cambie Street, driving her 1991 Honda Civic. The weather was clear and sunny. She was intending to turn right on Broadway (9th Avenue) in order to proceed to Oak Street and continue on to her home. Southbound traffic on Cambie Street was heavy. Ms. Najdychor was familiar with the area. She knew there was a right turn only lane on Cambie Street at the intersection of Broadway, which she was intending to use to make the turn onto Broadway. At approximately 6th Avenue, she changed lanes from the middle lane of three lanes to the curb lane.
4  The intersection at 7th Avenue is controlled by traffic lights. She proceeded through the 7th Avenue intersection in the curb lane without incident.
5  Cambie Street and 8th Avenue is an uncontrolled intersection. There is a slight uphill grade as one proceeds southbound towards Broadway. There are three lanes for through traffic in each direction. There is a left turn lane for southbound traffic on Cambie Street to turn eastbound into 8th Avenue, and a corresponding left turn lane for northbound traffic on Cambie Street to turn left, or westbound, onto 8th Avenue.
6  The curb lane ahead of Ms. Najdychor was clear as she approached the intersection of 8th Avenue and Cambie Street. She testified that as she approached the intersection, there were cars in the two lanes to her left (lanes one and two) which were moving, but more slowly than she was. She testified that her speed was 40 to 50 kph. She says that as she entered into the intersection of 8th and Cambie, a vehicle suddenly appeared in front of her. That was the defendant's vehicle attempting a left hand turn from northbound on Cambie Street to proceed westbound on 8th Avenue. The plaintiff testified that she did not see the defendant's vehicle until it was "right in front of me". She attempted to avoid hitting the defendant's vehicle by swerving and braking. She swerved to the right, but was unable to manoeuvre her vehicle back into the curb lane. She ended up hitting a metal lamp standard located on the sidewalk, a few inches away from the curb, and several feet south of the southwest corner of 8th Avenue and Cambie Street.
7  No engineering or traffic reconstruction evidence was presented. However, it is obvious from the post-crash photographs of the plaintiff's vehicle and from the evidence of other witnesses that the plaintiff's car hit the lamp standard head on, almost in the centre of the front end of her vehicle.
8  Emergency personnel attended. The plaintiff was taken to Vancouver General Hospital by ambulance for treatment. Her vehicle was not equipped with airbags. She sustained a fractured sternum and other injuries which will be described in further detail below. Her vehicle was written off.
9  The defendant, Carrie Swartz, was approximately 36 years of age at the date of the accident. She resided in Langley. She was driving her 2001 dark blue Pontiac Grand Am, which was owned by her husband, the defendant David Swartz. Her three children were in the back seat of the vehicle. She was expecting her fourth child. She and her children had been at the Oakridge shopping centre for a dental appointment, and had proceeded north on Cambie Street in order to go to a Boy Scout store to purchase a book. The store was located on Broadway, west of Cambie Street. She thought the accident happened at about 5:10 p.m. She said that the store closed at 5:30 p.m. and that she was not in a rush. She had thought that she could turn left at Cambie and Broadway, but found that she could not, and therefore proceeded to the next intersection which was 8th Avenue, in order to make a left turn and proceed westbound on 8th Avenue.
10  She testified that the traffic facing her in the lane nearest the centre line (lane one) had stopped and the driver of the lead vehicle in that lane had waved her through. The driver of the lead vehicle in lane two also waved her through. She said she made eye contact with the drivers of the lead vehicles in both the first and second lanes. She thought that as she passed the second lane, the front of her vehicle had protruded only about one foot into the third or curb lane. At that moment, she was stopped, or nearly stopped, when the vehicle driven by the plaintiff was "suddenly there".
11  Ms. Swartz recalled that there was a construction site at the southwest corner of 8th Avenue and Cambie Street. She thought that after the plaintiff's vehicle swerved, it hit a "construction pole" which was on the travel-worthy portion of the roadway. She thought that the plaintiff's vehicle was not on the curb or the sidewalk and nowhere near the street lamp standard that the plaintiff described hitting.
12  Ms. Swartz said that prior to moving into the curb lane, she had looked into that lane and seen no oncoming cars. She testified that the vehicles in lane one and two were very close to her, being only three feet away from her vehicle. At trial, she conceded that her view northbound into the curb lane was obscured by the vehicles in front of her, and that she could only see about one car length northbound into the curb lane. By contrast, on examination for discovery, she said that she had a clear and unobstructed view of the curb lane prior to entering it. She acknowledged on cross-examination that her estimate of a one foot encroachment into the curb lane at the time which she saw the plaintiff's vehicle was really a guess.
13  She first observed the plaintiff's vehicle when it was already in the intersection. She said things happened very quickly. She saw the car swerve. She was frightened, and she threw up her hands in reaction to the near collision. She thought her vehicle was going to be struck by the plaintiff's vehicle. She assumed that the plaintiff's vehicle must have been traveling at a high rate of speed because she "came from out of nowhere". However, she conceded that she actually had no ability whatsoever to estimate the speed of the plaintiff's vehicle before the collision.
14  After the accident, Ms. Swartz proceeded to complete her left hand turn into 8th Avenue. She stopped and went back to the accident scene.
15  She remained at the scene until about 6:00 p.m.
16  There were two independent witnesses to the accident.
17  Ms. Susan Adams and her then 14 year old son, Eldon Cruickshank, were walking northbound on the west side of Cambie Street, between 8th Avenue and Broadway.
18  Eldon Cruickshank was very familiar with the area. He recalled there was a lot of construction on that block. He and his mother were walking under construction scaffolding. There were narrow metal poles to their left and right, which supported a wooden roof. The scaffolding went all the way between 8th Avenue and Broadway. The scaffolding poles were metal, about one and half inches in diameter and arranged in a criss-cross pattern. There were no scaffolding poles on the street.
19  Based on the scene diagram, Mr. Cruickshank estimated his distance from the intersection at about 120 feet at the time of the accident. He saw the plaintiff's red Honda travelling towards them in the curb lane. The red car swerved to avoid the defendant's dark-coloured car. The plaintiff's red car hit two of the metal scaffolding poles and then struck the green lamp standard whereupon it came to rest. The two scaffolding poles were set loose and tumbled towards Mr. Cruickshank and his mother.
20  He thought that the defendant's vehicle had protruded by a foot into the curb lane at the time the plaintiff's red car swerved to avoid it. He thought the defendant's car had stopped just as the red car went by it.
21  Ms. Adams testified to similar effect. She said she was walking northbound on Cambie Street with her son, Eldon. They were headed to the Best Buy store in the area. The construction scaffolding was covering the sidewalk, but was not protruding onto the roadway at all. It was rush hour and the traffic was heavy. She thought the defendant's car was moving slowly through the intersection, creeping forward as it approached the curb lane, when the plaintiff's red car came up the hill, swerved, then moved in an arc back into the curb lane. It struck the construction scaffolding, which was thrown towards her and her son.
22  Constable Melanie Tomlinson of the Vancouver Police Department attended the accident scene. She particularly remembered that the construction scaffolding had been knocked loose. She was concerned about the hazardous condition that resulted. She attended at about 5:30 p.m., before the plaintiff was taken away by the ambulance. She recalled that the whole front of the plaintiff's vehicle was pushed in and had come to rest around the lamp standard. She testified that the speed limit in the area was 50 kph.
Analysis regarding liability
23  Section 174 of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 318 [the "Act"] provides as follows:
When a vehicle is in an intersection and its driver intends to turn left, the driver must yield the right of way to traffic approaching from the opposite direction that is in the intersection or so close as to constitute an immediate hazard, but having yielded and given a signal as required by sections 171 and 172, the driver may turn the vehicle to the left, and traffic approaching the intersection from the opposite direction must yield the right of way to the vehicle making the left turn.
24  The section and its predecessors have been considered in many cases. A leading decision is Pacheco (Guardian ad litem) v. Robinson ,  (C.A.).
25  In that case, the trial judge found that the defendant was in the course of a left hand turn when she struck the plaintiff who was riding a bicycle, which is a vehicle for purposes of the Act. The trial judge found that neither party saw the other until a fraction of second prior to the actual impact. The trial judge held that at the moment the defendant commenced her turn, the plaintiff cyclist was in the intersection. The trial judge held that while the defendant was clearly liable, the plaintiff ought to have exercised caution as he approached the intersection. He had failed to keep a proper lookout, and was liable to the extent of 25%. The Court of Appeal reversed the finding of contributory negligence and found the defendant 100% liable. Justice Legg, for the court, stated at paras. 10-11 as follows:
In my respectful opinion, the learned trial judge erred in law in finding the appellant contributory negligent. A defendant who wishes to make a left hand turn in an intersection has an obligation to yield to on-coming traffic which is in the intersection under the provision of s. 176 of the Motor Vehicle Act.
The plaintiff was not bound to guard against every conceivable eventuality but only against such eventualities as a reasonable person ought to have foreseen as being within the ordinary range of human experience. The plaintiff was entitled to proceed on the assumption that all other vehicles will do what it is their duty to do, namely observe the rules regulating traffic.
26  After referring to a prior Court of Appeal decision in Etter v. Trent,  (C.A.), Legg J.A. further stated at paras. 15 & 18:
In my opinion, a driver who wishes to make a left hand turn at an intersection has an obligation not to proceed unless it can be done safely. Where each party's vision of the other is blocked by traffic, the dominant driver who is proceeding through the intersection is generally entitled to continue and the servient left-turning driver must yield the right of way. The existence of a left-turning vehicle does not raise a presumption that something unexpected might happen and cast a duty on the dominant driver to take extra care. Where the defendant, as here, has totally failed to determine whether a turn can be made safely, the defendant should be held 100 percent at fault for a collision which occurs.
[...]
In my opinion, when a driver in a servient position disregards his statutory duty to yield the right of way and a collision results, then to fix any blame on the dominant driver, the servient driver must establish that after the dominant driver became aware, or by the exercise of reasonable care should have become aware, of the servient driver's own disregard of the law, the dominant driver had a sufficient opportunity to avoid the accident of which a reasonably careful and skilful driver would have availed himself. In such circumstance any doubt should be resolved in favour of the dominant driver. As stated by Cartwright, J. in Walker v. Brownlee,  (S.C.C.) at p. 461:
While the decision of every motor vehicle collision case must depend on its particular facts, I am of opinion that when A, the driver in the servient position, proceeds through an intersection in complete disregard of his statutory duty to yield the right-of-way and a collision results, if he seeks to cast any portion of the blame upon B, the driver having the right-of-way, A must establish that after B became aware, or by the exercise of reasonable care should have become aware, of A's disregard of the law B had in fact a sufficient opportunity to avoid the accident of which a reasonably careful and skilful driver would have availed himself; and I do not think that in such circumstances any doubts should be resolved in favour of A, whose unlawful conduct was fons et origo mali.
27  The definition of "immediate hazard" as used within s. 174 was considered by the Court of Appeal in Raie v. Thorpe (1963), 43 W.W.R. 405 (B.C.C.A.). In that decision, Tysoe J.A. stated at p. 410:
I do not propose to attempt an exhaustive definition of "immediate hazard." For the purposes of this appeal it is sufficient for me to say that, in my opinion, if an approaching car is so close to the intersection when a driver attempts to make a left turn that a collision threatens unless there be some violent or sudden avoiding action on the part of the driver of the approaching car, the approaching car is an "immediate hazard" within the meaning of sec. 164.
28  Justice Davey dissented with respect to the result, but defined "immediate hazard" in a very similar way at p. 406. Justice Wilson concurred in the result by affirming the decision of the trial judge.
29  Another decision of the Court of Appeal is Nijjer v. Hildebrandt, , . In that case, the plaintiff was heading south on King George Highway while the defendant was attempting to make a left hand turn from King George Highway into a lane at the west side of the highway. A collision resulted. The trial judge found that liability should be split equally, on the basis that while the defendant should have seen the plaintiff's approaching vehicle, recognized that it constituted an immediate hazard, and yielded the right of way, the plaintiff was not keeping a proper lookout. Had he done so, he would have seen the defendant's vehicle initiate its turn, and would have had an opportunity to yield the right of way to the defendant.
30  After referring to the conclusion of the trial judge, Donald J.A., for the court, stated at para. 22:
22  The plaintiff had the clear right of way. The defendant made an unsafe turn in front of him. The plaintiff's momentary inattention could not have affected liability having regard to two decisions of this Court. 
31  The court went on to refer to Etter and Pacheco and ultimately set aside the trial judge's finding of contributory negligence, thus assigning 100% liability to the defendant.
32  Despite these appellate decisions, there are trial level decisions which have found the driver of the vehicle contributory negligent for proceeding straight through the intersection in the circumstances of these cases.
33  In Clark v. Stricker, , the plaintiff was proceeding westbound on Southeast Marine Drive towards the intersection of Chester Street. It was a dry and sunny day. At the intersection in question, Southeast Marine Drive comprises three lanes westbound and three lanes eastbound, with a median dividing east and westbound traffic. Traffic was heavy. The plaintiff was in the westbound curb lane. The plaintiff's view to her left was obscured or blocked by the presence of a large "cube" van in lane two (the middle lane). The traffic to her left was stopped due to the volume of traffic. The intersection of Chester Street was free of stopped cars. The defendant had been proceeding eastbound on Southeast Marine Drive and was making a left hand turn through the intersection to proceed north on Chester. Upon entering the curb lane, the defendant's vehicle struck the plaintiff's vehicle. Justice Melvin agreed with the submission of the defendant that any prudent driver proceeding westbound in the curb lane with traffic stopped to his or her left should exercise caution on entering the intersection, particularly as the westbound driver's view to his or her left will be obscured by the stopped traffic. The plaintiff in Clark was found 25% at fault for the accident. Justice Melvin stated at para. 10:
In my opinion, a prudent driver should anticipate that there is a reason for traffic to their left being stopped at an uncontrolled intersection. To enter the intersection under those circumstances without slowing or observing that it is clear of pedestrians or other vehicles, in my view, is negligent.
34  He found support for that proposition in the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Nash v. Sullivan ,  (C.A.), a decision which is referred to, but distinguished in Pacheco at para. 23. In referring to and distinguishing Nash, I note that the court in Pacheco neither approved nor disapproved of the decision.
35  The decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Nash is very brief. The plaintiff was riding a motorcycle in the southbound curb lane as he approached the intersection. The curb lane was "partially blocked' by a car parked in the curb lane approximately 40 feet north of the intersection. The defendant, who was driving northbound, was making a left hand turn which would take him across the path of the plaintiff's southbound motorcycle. A car in the southbound centre lane had stopped to allow the defendant to make his left hand turn. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff had a duty to exercise care in the circumstances and that he was negligent in failing to slow his motorcycle and keep a proper lookout when he saw or should have seen that the cars in the line of traffic to his left had stopped. Furthermore, he had approached the intersection in such a manner that he was hidden from the view of motorists intending to make a left turn. That situation created an obligation upon him to act prudently. The Court went on to say at 134-135:
There is no question that a heavy onus rests upon the defendant driver attempting to make a left turn in the face of oncoming traffic but this was a most unusual situation and we do not feel that the standard to be imposed upon the defendant is a standard of perfection. It was a situation of potential danger of which both parties should have been aware.
36  The Court held that liability should be equally divided between the parties.
37  In Lesavage v. Lee,  (S.C.), the plaintiff was proceeding northbound in the curb lane on Cambie Street approaching the intersection of 13th Avenue. Traffic was backed up from the lights at 12th Avenue, but the intersection at 13th Avenue was clear of stopped cars. The defendant was travelling southbound on Cambie Street. He turned left at 13th Avenue, intending to proceed east, and struck the plaintiff's car. The defendant said he could not see into the curb lane as he approached it and that he therefore inched forward slowly while craning his neck to try and see. He knew vehicles might be in the curb lane as he started to cross it. Justice Low held that making a left turn across a flow of rush hour traffic was a difficult manoeuvre and to do so across three lanes of such traffic was considerably more difficult. The defendant proceeded with his left turn, expecting traffic to be in the curb lane, yet he entered that lane with no ability to see where approaching vehicles were. He commenced his turn abruptly and entered the curb lane without stopping. Justice Low found that when the defendant commenced his turn, the plaintiff's approaching vehicle constituted an immediate hazard. The defendant was unable to see the plaintiff's vehicle and he also knew that his vehicle would not be visible to a driver approaching in the curb lane.
38  However, Low J. found that the plaintiff, for her part, was going a little too fast for the driving situation. He held that a backup of vehicles from the traffic light at 12th Avenue was to be expected. The plaintiff was overtaking vehicles on her left and should have been aware of the possibility of northbound vehicles stopping at 13th Avenue to permit southbound vehicles to turn east. She did not see the defendant's vehicle at all. She was not keeping an adequate lookout to her left. Had she done so and at a lower speed, she might have avoided the collision or, more likely, come away with less serious physical consequences to her car and her person. She was held to be contributorily negligent to the extent of 20%.
39  I return to the evidence in this case. Although I have no doubt that Ms. Swartz sincerely tried to give her best account in her testimony, in several respects, her recollection was flawed. For example, she stated in her statement to ICBC, which was made shortly after the accident, that the plaintiff's vehicle had hit a "construction pole" which was situated in the roadway of the curb lane. She said the same thing at trial. I find that there was no such construction pole in the curb lane. The plaintiff's vehicle struck the lamp standard situated on the sidewalk a few feet north of the southwest corner of 8th Avenue and Cambie Street. Before striking that lamp standard, she also struck some of the construction scaffolding along the western side of Cambie Street between 8th Avenue and Broadway, as testified to by Ms. Adams and her son Eldon. Their recollection of that was clear. The plaintiff, not surprisingly, did not recall striking the construction scaffolding, but she certainly recalled hitting the pole against which her vehicle came to rest. The photographs make it abundantly clear that her vehicle struck a sturdy and wide pole which left a major obvious indentation in the front centre of her vehicle. The police officer, Melanie Tomlinson, testified that the vehicle was resting against the pole when she attended the scene.
40  Her evidence was inconsistent on the important question of whether she could clearly see into lane three as she approached it. On her examination for discovery, she said she had a clear and unobstructed view of lane three prior to entering it. Her statement to ICBC was similar, as she stated that she "looked down the 3rd lane of 3 to make sure it was clear for me to proceed with my left turn onto 8th Avenue when I did notice a red Honda motor vehicle coming down lane 3 of 3 going at a fast speed". It is clear to me that Ms. Swartz could not have had a clear view of lane three or else she would have seen the plaintiff's vehicle.
41  I find that the defendant was proceeding slowly through the intersection, as she crossed lanes one and two and entered lane three, the curb lane. The plaintiff was unable to estimate the speed of the defendant's vehicle as it entered lane three, but she said that the vehicle was moving and that it entered lane three "confidently". It is impossible to ascertain the speed of the defendant's vehicle as it entered the curb lane, but in the circumstances, even a slow speed would result in the sudden appearance of the defendant's vehicle in front of the plaintiff, and would account for the plaintiff's reaction in violently swerving her vehicle in order to avoid a collision.
42  I find that the defendant's vehicle entered lane three while the plaintiff's vehicle was either in the intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard. The plaintiff's vehicle had the right of way, and the defendant's vehicle was required to yield. Neither driver could see the other's vehicle until the point at which they almost collided. However, it was the duty of the defendant not to move into the curb lane unless the manoeuvre could be done safely, and that there was no southbound traffic in the curb lane that could result in a collision. She could not see into the curb lane and therefore, should not have proceeded into the curb lane in the circumstances. The defendant therefore was at fault for the accident and was negligent.
43  I also find that at the moment the plaintiff first was able to see the defendant's vehicle, it was not stationary, but was, in fact, moving into the plaintiff's lane of travel. If the defendant's vehicle had not been moving into the curb lane, the plaintiff, who was a reliable and careful witness, would not have been so startled by the appearance of the vehicle. The plaintiff, being surprised upon seeing the movement of the defendant's vehicle into her lane, swerved to avoid a collision. A collision between the vehicles might or might not have occurred had she not swerved. However, it was the negligence of the defendant that caused the plaintiff to swerve in order to avoid a collision, thus resulting in the accident. I do not attribute any negligence on the part of the plaintiff for responding to the situation as she did.
44  The plaintiff testified that her speed while proceeding southbound on Cambie was between 40 and 50 kph. This was within the applicable posted speed limit. I accept that she was travelling at that speed. It was not an unreasonable speed in the circumstances.
45  The defendant argues that the plaintiff was passing stopped vehicles and that had she been paying careful attention, she would have noted that there was a gap in traffic as she approached the intersection of Cambie Street and 8th Avenue. Therefore, she should have slowed down. Had she done so, the violent swerving manoeuvre that she undertook would have been unnecessary and no accident would have resulted. This is similar to the reasoning that has resulted in a finding of some contributory negligence on the part of the dominant driver in other cases: see Clark (25%); Lesavage (20%). However, it is trite law that every motor vehicle collision must be assessed on its particular facts: Walker v. Brownlee and Harmon,  (S.C.C.). The burden is on the defendant to establish contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.
46  I do not accept that the plaintiff was passing stopped vehicles to her left in lanes one and two. Her evidence was that they were moving, but more slowly than she was. In her statement to ICBC, Ms. Swartz said the traffic in lane one stopped first and waved her through. She then moved her vehicle slightly forward "and then lane 2 of 3 stopped". This evidence is not inconsistent with the plaintiff's evidence that the vehicles in lanes one and two were moving as she approached the intersection. I find that they were moving. This fact distinguishes this case from Clark and Lesavage.
47  I pause to note that in city driving, it is an extremely common occurrence for a driver in the curb or right hand lane to be passing slower moving vehicles to the driver's left as the driver approaches an intersection.
48  I return again to the statement of Legg J.A. in Pacheco at para 15:
Where each party's vision of the other is blocked by traffic, the dominant driver who is proceeding through the intersection is generally entitled to continue and the servient left-turning driver must yield the right of way. The existence of a left-turning vehicle does not raise a presumption that something unexpected might happen and cast a duty on the dominant driver to take extra care.
49  In order to establish liability on the part of the plaintiff, the defendant must establish that the plaintiff was aware, or by the exercise of reasonable care, should have become aware, of the defendant's disregard of the law, and that after becoming aware of the defendant's vehicle, the plaintiff had a sufficient opportunity to avoid the accident. Any doubt about this should be resolved in favour of the driver having the right of way: Walker.
50  The principle originating in Toronto Railway v. King,  at 269 (P.C.), is that:
... traffic in the streets would be impossible if the driver of each vehicle did not proceed more or less upon the assumption that the drivers of all the other vehicles will do what it is their duty to do, namely, observe the rules regulating the traffic of the streets.
51  On this basis, even momentary inattention is not sufficient to render the dominant driver negligent: Bissky v. Trottier  (S.C.), applied in Etter.
52  The question is whether in the circumstances, the plaintiff was negligent (1) in not foreseeing that the defendant's vehicle would enter her lane, contrary to the right of way the plaintiff held, and in a manner that threatened to cause an immediate serious collision, or (2) in the manner in which she responded. I find that the plaintiff was not negligent in not anticipating what, for her, was the sudden appearance of the defendant's vehicle, nor was she negligent in swerving to avoid a collision with the defendant's vehicle, resulting in the collision with the pole. I see no distinction in this respect with decisions such as Pacheco where the negligence of the defendant resulted in a collision with the defendant's vehicle. I find that the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.
Assessment of Damages
Background
53  On the date of the accident, the plaintiff was 32 years of age. She was in good health. She and her common law spouse of 13 years, Brian King, had purchased their home in Ladner on March 14, 2006, shortly before the motor vehicle accident of June 13, 2006. Previously they had lived in an apartment in downtown Vancouver. Ms. Najdychor and her husband have no children. When they purchased the home in Ladner, they were contemplating starting a family, but had not made any firm plans in that respect.
54  Ms. Najdychor was born in Poland and immigrated to Canada in 1982 at eight years of age. After graduating from high school, she obtained a diploma in marketing management at Kwantlen College.
55  At the time, she had been employed by the Whitefish Group for just over four years. She was a retail operations manager, having responsibility for the management of five Seattle's Best Coffee cafés. She spent most of her time working in the office, but was on the road between 25 and 35% of the time. She earned a salary of <damage type = "other">$48,500</damage> per annum, and also received bonuses and benefits.
56  She was moderately active. She walked regularly and enjoyed gardening in the rooftop garden of the west end Vancouver apartment that she and her husband had resided in, prior to moving to Ladner. She also enjoyed bicycling.
57  The home in Ladner was their first home purchase. The house has four bedrooms. Her plans for landscaping and decorating of the home have been postponed due to the accident injuries.
58  The Honda Civic that she was driving at the time of the accident was equipped with a seatbelt and shoulder strap which were being worn by Ms. Najdychor at the time of the accident. As noted, the vehicle was not equipped with air bags. Her body was restrained by the shoulder strap and seatbelt. She testified that she hit her head on the steering wheel and that her knee hit the dash board. Immediately after the impact, she tried to get out of the vehicle but fell onto the ground. It is clear from the accident photos that her vehicle struck the lamp standard with a great deal of force. She suffered immediate extreme pain in her chest. A CT scan was conducted at Vancouver General Hospital. It showed a minimally displaced fracture of the sternum. She was discharged from the hospital about 2:30 a.m. the next morning and taken home by her husband.
59  Photographs taken the next day show injuries to her forehead, neck, upper chest, abdomen, upper leg, and right knee. She also sustained a cut on the forehead and a nose bleed.
60  During the first week after the accident, her husband stayed home from work to look after her. She required extensive help. Brian King testified that for the first week post-accident, Ms. Najdychor had almost no mobility. She needed help with feeding, bathing, and getting in and out of bed. Brian King testified that during the first few days, any movement caused her severe pain.
61  She saw her long-time family doctor, Dr. Morris Gordon, six days post-accident on June 19, 2006. She was using strong painkillers and was having considerable trouble moving. His examination on that date revealed significant tenderness in her mid-back and over the breast bone. She was obviously very incapacitated, according to Dr. Gordon. He made a diagnosis of soft tissue injuries as well as a fractured sternum. He prescribed pain medication and muscle relaxants. He advised her to remain off work.
62  Dr. Gordon saw her again in late June and early July. She was continuing to have considerable trouble. She complained about ringing in her ears and problems with her right temporomandibular joint, which was locking intermittently.
63  By the end of July, she was still struggling, according to Dr. Gordon. She was continuing to have decreased range of motion of her right shoulder, right trapezius muscle, and her back. She continued to have TMJ problems. She was continuing to take painkillers. A decision was made to attempt a graduated return to work program.
64  Ms. Najdychor returned to work at the Whitefish Group on August 2, 2006, approximately seven weeks post-accident.
65  She continued to see Dr. Gordon every few months. The sternum injury healed gradually, without any ongoing problems. When Dr. Gordon saw her at the end of August, she was seeing a chiropractor and physiotherapist for assistance with respect to her back and shoulder. Her right shoulder was one of her biggest problems at that time. Her dentist had sent her to see an oral surgeon with respect to her TMJ problems. She continued to struggle with problems in her shoulder, right hip, low back, and jaw.
66  In early March 2007, Dr. Gordon prescribed Trazadone, for help with depression and as a sleeping aid. At trial, the plaintiff testified that she continues to have a lot of trouble sleeping due to her injuries, but uses this medication as little as possible. By October 2007, more than a year after the accident, she was continuing to attend acupuncture, chiropractic, and massage therapy treatment. She was also engaged in an exercise program and doing yoga once a week. She was seeing a naturopathic physician in addition to Dr. Gordon.
67  Because of her slow progress, in October 2007, Dr. Gordon referred Ms. Najdychor to Dr. Henry King, an expert in musculoskeletal pain management, manual therapy, and occupational medicine. She has continued under Dr. King's treatment to the present.
68  Dr. Gordon reports that by May 2008, Ms. Najdychor told him that she was doing quite well. She was continuing to do regular exercises and was "85 percent resolved". Her main ongoing problems were right posterior hip and right shoulder pain. She was able to walk, cycle, and participate in yoga. She was still unable to sit for prolonged periods. She was continuing with acupuncture and chiropractic treatment, and continuing to have problems with her jaw.
69  Her last visit with Dr. Gordon prior to the trial was on October 15, 2008. At that time, she told him that she was continuing to improve. Her hip was doing quite well. She was still suffering from ongoing discomfort in her right shoulder blade area. The right low back was still bothering her from time to time. She continued to see Dr. King as well as to receive acupuncture and massage therapy treatment.
70  Dr. Gordon's diagnosis was of significant soft tissue injuries and a fractured sternum. She took several weeks off work which Dr. Gordon thought was totally appropriate in light of the severity of her injuries. As for prognosis, Dr. Gordon noted that Ms. Najdychor had continued to improve although she suffered from ongoing concerns. He remained hopeful that her injuries would completely resolve, but noted that this was always unpredictable. He noted that she "may be left with some mild discomfort in the future". However, she was not at risk of any severe consequences as a result of her injuries. She obtained some symptomatic benefit from chiropractic and massage therapy treatments, but Dr. Gordon was of the view that these treatments would not ultimately change the natural history of her problems. Dr. Gordon noted that Ms. Najdychor had been a very well motivated and reasonable patient throughout the course of her recovery.
71  Ms. Najdychor first saw Dr. Henry King on November 13, 2007. He has seen her on 10 occasions in total, most recently, on January 27, 2009.
72  Dr. King diagnosed a myofascial dysfunction, affecting the muscles and connective tissues of the right side of her low back and right shoulder. Although these have improved, they have not resolved and she remains vulnerable to, as Dr. King described it, the physical and emotional stresses of her lifestyle and work. Dr. King stated that Ms. Najdychor was suffering from chronic effects of strain in the areas affected by the accident, i.e. cervical and lumbar spinal, pelvic, and right shoulder griddle strains. According to Dr. King, the acute inflammatory problems resulting directly from the tissue trauma sustained in the motor vehicle accident probably mostly healed within a few months. Her persistent shoulder and back symptoms and other physical signs probably resulted from the myofascial dysfunction of the muscles and lax ligaments in the painful areas. He described "myofascial dysfunction" as abnormal muscle, ligament, and other connective tissue function that incorporates a discrete area of tenderness with an accompanying palpable abnormality in the consistency of the affected muscle and other soft tissues in or near the tender point.
73  Dr. King's therapy centred on manual manipulation and on teaching Ms. Najdychor self-treatment techniques and remedial exercises. She was advised to continue with her usual activities and postures as long as these did not provoke prolonged periods [more than six to twelve hours] of pain or stiffness.
74  Dr. King noted that Ms. Najdychor had excellent motivation and was cooperative. Her symptoms were gradually lessening in severity, but had not yet disappeared. When last assessed in January 2009, about three months before the trial, Dr. King felt that her symptoms would likely persist with decreasing severity for at least another year, and probably more. During that time, she would need to continue regular (daily) self-treatment techniques and remedial exercises, and try to remain as active as possible in activities that did not provoke prolonged pain. He thought that if the symptoms did not resolve within a few months, then further investigations such as x-rays, bone scans, or blood tests might be merited. He thought that she was not a candidate for traditional chiropractic treatment, but could still be helped by further physical therapies administered by him, a physiotherapist, or massage therapist.
75  At the request of the defendant, the plaintiff saw Dr. N.K. Reebye for an independent medical examination on July 13, 2007. Dr. Reebye's report demonstrates that he took a thorough history and preformed a thorough physical examination of Ms. Najdychor. He diagnosed the fracture of the sternum and soft tissue injuries in several areas as complained of by Ms. Najdychor. At the time of the examination, she had residual pain in the right shoulder, and mild soft tissue injuries in the areas of her neck and lower back. He noted the jaw injury. He thought the injuries would gradually improve over time, and he anticipated no permanent physical impairments or disability. He thought that while she had followed an appropriate course of treatment to the date of his examination, there was no need for further follow-up treatments. Like Dr. King, he mentioned the possibility of a bone scan if her problems in the shoulder and right hip did not resolve in due course.
76  Dr. Reebye noted that according to the plaintiff, she had gained approximately 20 pounds since the accident. She also had difficulty sleeping. She had been prescribed anti-depressant medication which made her feel foggy the next day and so she took it only on and off for awhile and had since stopped taking it.
77  Dr. Burton H. Goldstein, an expert in oral medicine and maxillofacial surgery, provided a report based upon an examination conducted September 23, 2008. He diagnosed a mild temporomandibular disorder. Dr. Goldstein's report notes that Ms. Najdychor had seen Dr. Michelle Williams, a certified specialist in oral medicine, in 2006 and 2007, who had made treatment recommendations. Dr. Goldstein thought that Ms. Najdychor had a good prognosis with appropriate management of her condition and that there was no indication of any jaw-related impairment or disability.
78  Ms. Najdychor returned to work at the Whitefish Group after an absence of seven weeks. She worked half days for one week and then returned to work full-time.
79  Soon after the accident, the nature of her work changed significantly, as her employer decided to close the five cafés that Ms. Najdychor was responsible for managing. For several months, she was involved in the process of closing down the outlets. She was transferred to a different office on West 5th Avenue in Vancouver. Her job became 100% desk work and involved working on a computer. She found it difficult to sit at a desk all day. As the nature of her duties changed, she did not enjoy her work. Her new title was Business Development Coordinator. The role did not have the same level of responsibility as she previously had and she was dissatisfied in it. She resigned her employment effective July 11, 2007.
80  She immediately began a seven week vacation in Poland with her mother.
81  She applied for employment insurance. She testified that part of her reason for resigning included the accident injuries which made it difficult for her to sit at a desk eight hours per day.
82  She was then off work for a year. On July 14, 2008, she commenced work as an Executive Assistant with the Municipality of Delta, working at the Delta Municipal Hall in Ladner, very near to her residence. She worked there first on a casual basis and then on a temporary full-time basis until September 4, 2008, when she resigned to work elsewhere. She then took a job with the B.C. Lottery Corporation working at its offices in Richmond as a sales facilities coordinator, commencing September 8, 2008. The position was described as "temporary" and extending until March 31, 2009 with possible extension or reduction as required. The pay was <damage type = "other">$50,000</damage> per annum, with a bonus program.
83  Ms. Najdychor resigned from the B.C. Lottery Corporation position effective October 17, 2008, after only six weeks of employment. She informed her employer that she was unable to do the amount of driving that was required in the role, as a result of her back injury. She resumed work immediately thereafter at the Municipality of Delta, on a temporary full-time assignment which ended April 3, 2009. She returned to work as a part-time auxiliary on-call employee on April 21, 2009, but this work is expected to end in June 2009.
84  Ms. Najdychor does not claim for wage loss with respect to the one year period from the time of her resignation from Whitefish Group on July 11, 2007, and prior to commencing work with the Municipality of Delta on July 14, 2008. She claims for wage loss for the seven week period immediately following the accident, and for further wage loss following her resignation from the B.C. Lottery Corporation, to the date of trial, and for future loss of earnings.
Analysis
85  The plaintiff claims as follows:
Non-pecuniary loss: <damage type = "other">$65,000</damage>;
Special damages: <damage type = "other">$6,705.98</damage>;
Cost of future care: <damage type = "other">$3,850.85</damage>;
Past income loss: <damage type = "other">$11,205.56</damage>;
Future income loss: <damage type = "other">$37,230.08</damage>.
86  She also makes an in-trust claim for the benefit of her common law spouse in the amount of <damage type = "other">$1,847.62</damage> for his lost income while he cared for her after the accident.
87  The position of the defendant is as follows:
Non-pecuniary loss: <damage type = "other">$25,000-$35,000</damage>;
Special damages: <damage type = "other">$2,358.48</damage>;
Cost of future care: nil;
Past income loss: <damage type = "other">$4,203.91</damage>;
Future income loss: nil.
88  The defendant also says that general damages should be reduced by 10 to 20% as a result of the plaintiff's failure to mitigate. The defence alleges that Ms. Najdychor attended with Dr. King inconsistently and did not adequately carry out his instructions for self help exercises. She delayed unreasonably in undertaking treatment for her TMJ condition.
Non-pecuniary Damages
89  The purpose of an award of non-pecuniary damages is to ameliorate the condition of the victim considering his or her particular situation. The gravity of the injury is not determinative. An appreciation of the individual's loss is the key, and the award will vary in each case to meet the specific circumstances of the individual case: Stapley v. Hejslet, ,  at para. 45. As set out in Stapley at para. 46, common factors include the age of the plaintiff, the nature of the injury, severity and duration of pain, disability, emotional suffering, and loss or impairment of life. Additional factors may be impairment of family, marital and social relationships, impairment of physical and mental abilities, loss of lifestyle, and the plaintiff's stoicism, in the sense that stoicism should not penalize the plaintiff.
90  Although every case is unique, and the award must reflect the circumstances as they relate to the plaintiff, other decisions of the courts provide useful guidance.
91  The plaintiff suffered a fractured sternum and serious soft tissue injuries which were, initially, completely disabling. She returned to work seven weeks post-accident, working part-time for the first week. It is now nearly three years post-accident and the plaintiff continues to suffer from pain in her right hip and low back area, right shoulder pain, and jaw. Her major ongoing complaint regards sitting for prolonged periods of time, including at a desk, or when driving.
92  Ms. Najdychor has made a sincere and conscientious effort to recover. In her zeal to get better, she has undertaken much treatment. However I do not find that the treatment she has undertaken was unreasonable.
93  She obtained relief with the aid of Dr. Henry King. He noted that she had to be taught and re-taught the self-help treatments that he prescribed for her. However, he noted that this kind of pattern was not unusual in cases such as this. Patients tend to get discouraged. In my view, the plaintiff has adhered to and performed the self-treatment techniques taught by Dr. King and adhered to all of the medical advice that she has received to the best of her ability, with one exception.
94  The exception is with respect to the treatment of her TMJ problem. In late 2006, Dr. Michelle Williams recommended that Ms. Najdychor wear a dental splint (occlusal appliance) overnight. At trial, she testified that she did not follow that advice until earlier this year, due to two factors: the cost of the splint, which was <damage type = "other">$700</damage>, and the fact that her TMJ problem was a relatively minor one compared to her other injuries, and that she preferred to focus on those other injuries. The plaintiff is now using the dental splint appliance at night. It is an uncomfortable device involving both the upper and lower jaw. She cannot speak when wearing it. She finds that she is obtaining some improvement in her condition through the use of the appliance.
95  There is a clear failure to mitigate on the part of the plaintiff with respect to her delay in purchasing and utilizing the dental splint. However, the TMJ problem is, as the plaintiff indicated, one of her more minor concerns.
96  I accept that the plaintiff's complaints as noted in the medical reports and as testified to at trial are genuine, and that they have interfered with her normal activities and lifestyle to a significant degree. She has gradually made a good recovery although she is not yet symptom-free. She continues to have pain and limitation of function. She continues to suffer from problems sleeping. She has gained approximately 20 to 25 pounds since the accident and as a result of lack of physical activity. Her husband testified that her injuries have significantly interfered with their marriage, and I accept that evidence.
97  When she saw her general practitioner, Dr. Morris Gordon, in May of 2008, she said she was 85% resolved. She has continued to improve since that time. Dr. Gordon remains hopeful that her injuries will completely resolve, but as he said, this is always unpredictable and she may be left with some mild discomfort in future. In his report based upon his examination of July 13, 2007, Dr. Reebye also made a prognosis for gradual improvement over time. He acknowledged that it was possible that her symptoms could persist for a long time, which they clearly have. Finally, Dr. King thought her symptoms would likely persist with decreasing severity for at least another year and probably more, from the date he last saw her, which was January 27, 2009.
98  There was some difference of medical opinion with respect to the question of future medical treatment. Dr. Gordon, thought that chiropractic and/or massage therapy treatments provided symptomatic benefits, but would not ultimately change the natural history of her condition. Dr. Reebye was of the view that there was no need for further treatments as his examination on July 13, 2007, although he allowed for the possibility of continuing problems including further investigation and treatment if required. Dr. King thought that she "may be helped" by further physical-type therapies such as those administered by himself or others.
99  The overall prognosis is therefore very optimistic. Ms. Najdychor is now almost completely recovered and her recovery will continue. She is likely to completely recover at some point in time in the future. I accept the opinion of Dr. King that her symptoms will persist for another year and probably more. Her current symptoms are quite mild.
100  In support of her submission of a non-pecuniary award of <damage type = "other">$65,000</damage>, the plaintiff referred me to the following authorities: Perren v. Lalari, ; Ufimzeff v. Brown, ; Higgerty v. Hazell, ; Locki v. Anderson,  (S.C.); and Atwater v. Reese, . In these cases, the award of non-pecuniary loss ranged from <damage type = "other">$50,000</damage> (Perren, Ufimzeff and Atwater) to $70,000 (Higgerty). The defence referred me to Job v. Van Blankers,  (<damage type = "other">$25,000</damage>, prior to reduction of 10% for failure to mitigate), and Guilbault v. Purser,  (<damage type = "other">$35,000</damage>).
101  In Perren, the plaintiff suffered neck and low back soft tissue injuries in an accident that occurred 44 months prior to the trial. At the time of the accident, she had one infant daughter. Shortly after the accident, she became pregnant with her second child. She was off work for one to two months post-accident. The Court accepted that she was at risk of premature arthritis in her cervical spine and left shoulder. The Court was satisfied that she had chronic pain associated with her soft tissue injuries and that her pain and discomfort would continue indefinitely. After reviewing the authorities, Macaulay J. determined that the award for non-pecuniary loss should be <damage type = "other">$50,000</damage>, including loss of general homemaking capacity.
102  In Ufimzeff, the plaintiff was a 63 year old woman who worked on a family farm. She suffered a moderate soft tissue injury to her back and a fracture to her sternum. As a result of her injuries, she was entirely unable to perform the physical labours associated with the operation of the family farm for approximately six months and the injuries continued to substantially impair her abilities in that regard, and so the farm was sold about a year after the accident. Her injuries continued to limit her activities at the time of trial three years post-accident, and would likely continue in future, although they would be moderate. The award of non-pecuniary damages was <damage type = "other">$50,000</damage>.
103  In Higgerty, the plaintiff was a female who was 41 years of age at the time of the trial in 2000, approximately four years post-accident. She suffered from sternum and chest wall injuries, soft tissue injuries to the neck, upper back, mid back, and lower back, and bruising, a fractured left toe, headaches, post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. As of the date of trial, she continued to complain of her injuries. The Court held that her pain and discomfort had only gradually improved with a combination of time, physiotherapy and exercise, and that her condition had plateaued, such that any further recovery would be limited and very gradual. The non-pecuniary loss award was <damage type = "other">$70,000</damage>.
104  In Locki, the accident took place in 1989 and the trial was in 1992. The plaintiff was 62 years of age at the time of the trial. She suffered from a dislocation of the right ankle, a fracture of the right wrist, a fractured sternum, and other minor injuries. The most serious injuries were to her ankle and wrist. She was in hospital for 23 days. <damage type = "other">$60,000</damage> was awarded for non-pecuniary loss. However, the decision is now quite dated and in any event, is not sufficiently comparable to be of much assistance.
105  In Atwater, the plaintiff was 24 years of age at the time of trial in 2009, approximately two and three-quarter years post-accident. Justice Macaulay held that the plaintiff had sustained a lower moderate soft tissue injury which resulted in chronic pain and mild anxiety. At the time of trial, she was suffering from chronic pain, but her condition was amenable to improvement provided she increased her tolerance for recreational activity. <damage type = "other">$50,000</damage> was awarded for non-pecuniary loss.
106  In Job (cited by the defence), the plaintiff was a 29 year old female at the time of the collision, approximately one year prior to the trial. The Court held that at best, the evidence established a mild to moderate soft tissue injury to the plaintiff's neck, back and shoulders. She suffered from tingling in her left arm, headaches, discomfort when sitting or standing for any length of time, and an inability to lift objects or perform some domestic chores, without experiencing some onset of pain. The injuries had not fully resolved as at the time of trial. Non-pecuniary losses were assessed at <damage type = "other">$25,000</damage> less 10% for failure to mitigate, as the plaintiff had failed to follow through on her doctor's referrals.
107  The other case cited by the defence is Guilbault. The accident occurred four and a half years pre-trial. Justice Blair held that the plaintiff suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck, shoulder and right hip. The right hip complaint was an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition. The plaintiff also suffered from particularly distressing headaches. By the time of trial, the complaints emanating from the accident were largely resolved, although the plaintiff continued to suffer from occasional headaches and some neck pain. Her injuries affected her physical capabilities over the four and a half years prior to the accident and would continue to do so to some degree into the future. The Court held that the plaintiff had enjoyed a particularly active lifestyle and therefore, her injuries would have a greater impact upon her than they would upon someone whose lifestyle was more sedentary. <damage type = "other">$35,000</damage> was awarded.
108  Having regard to all of the factors set out in Stapley, and the other authorities to which I was referred, in my view, an appropriate award for non-pecuniary loss in this case is <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$60,000</damage>.
109  There has been a failure to mitigate with respect to treatment for the TMJ complaint, which is a minor part of Ms. Najdychor's overall complaints. There will be a reduction of <damage type = "reduction by">$1,000</damage> on the ground of failure to mitigate with respect to this one complaint.
Special damages
110  The plaintiff has incurred out-of-pocket expenses in the amount of <damage type = "other">$6,705.98</damage> and claims for reimbursement of that amount. The defence says that the expenses incurred after July 13, 2007 when the plaintiff saw Dr. Reebye are unnecessary and should not be allowed.
111  In my opinion, while the plaintiff has undertaken much treatment for her injuries, none of the treatment was unreasonable, and the defendant benefits from her favourable prognosis. The special damages amount claimed is reasonable and will be allowed in full.
Cost of future care
112  Dr. Gordon was of the view that further treatment would not change the natural history of her problems, but may provide relief of symptoms. Dr. King was also of the view that Ms. Najdychor "may be helped" by further physical-type therapies administered by him, a physiotherapist, or a massage therapist. Treatment by Dr. King has been beneficial in the past. The cost is covered by the Medical Services Plan. I note that there is no claim for the cost of treatment by Dr. King in the plaintiff's special damages claims. In my view, if there is any need for future treatment, which is doubtful on the evidence, the plaintiff should continue to obtain that treatment from Dr. King, who has rendered capable and effective care in the past. On this basis, no award is warranted for cost of future care.
Past income loss
113  The plaintiff claims for the loss of the sum of <damage type = "sub-past wage loss">$5,267.42 for the seven weeks that she was away from work following the motor vehicle accident. This sum will be allowed.
114  The plaintiff claims a further sum of <damage type = "other">$5,938.34</damage> based upon the difference between the income that she would have received had she stayed employed with BC Lottery Corporation ("BCLC") and the income she did receive at the Municipality of Delta. The plaintiff alleges that the nature of the BCLC work prevented her from continuing in that occupation and that she was forced to seek other work such as with the Municipality of Delta, where there was little driving involved.
115  The defence position is that Ms. Najdychor could have stayed at her Whitefish Group job, and that in any event, the evidence does not support a claim for past wage loss beyond the initial seven week period following the accident.
116  Mr. Cory Baran is a sales manager with BCLC. He testified that the head office of BCLC is in Kamloops. It has offices in Richmond as well, which is where he is stationed. The plaintiff was hired to work out of the Richmond offices. BCLC has 600 to 700 employees. Its operations cover gaming in British Columbia including lotteries, casinos, and bingo. Mr. Baran was Ms. Najdychor's second supervisor at BCLC. She was initially hired to work under Mr. Troy Faye, but due to the nature of the work, Ms. Najdychor was transferred to Mr. Baran's supervision.
117  Mr. Baran confirmed that Ms. Najdychor's work at the BCLC involved a lot of travel by car. He confirmed that her work was essentially that of a "jobber". She would travel to pubs, bars, casinos and bingo halls to ensure that these locations were adequately stocked with BCLC's products and promotional materials. The majority of her work was at these sites. Mr. Baran thought that the physical demands of the job were moderate. Her territory was province-wide. She would work independently, and would need to drive for the work. He wanted someone to do this work so that his sales and territory managers would not have to take up their valuable time doing it.
118  Although Ms. Najdychor was hired as a temporary worker with a fixed end date of March 31, 2009, there were good prospects that the job would develop into a full-time position. Mr. Baran had no problem with her performance on the job.
119  Dr. King's advice is that the plaintiff should remain as active as possible as long as her activities do not cause prolonged pain. I accept the plaintiff's evidence that driving for extended periods of time continue to cause her pain. Based upon the medical advice of Dr. King, excessive driving continues to be contra-indicated. I accept the plaintiff's evidence that she resigned from the BCLC job because she could not do it. I accept that had she continued to do it, the job would have been detrimental to her recovery. Her inability to carry on with the BCLC job resulted from the accident injuries. The fact that she might have made different decisions and stayed at Whitefish Group is immaterial. I therefore accept that the plaintiff has suffered a past income loss in the amount claimed, for the period following her resignation from BCLC to April 21, 2009, in the amount of <damage type = "sub-past wage loss">$5,939.34</damage>.
120  The total amount of past wage loss to be allowed is <damage type = "past wage loss">$11,206.76</damage>.
Future income loss
121  The plaintiff claims for future income loss of <damage type = "other">$38,672.64</damage>, based upon the theory that she will continue to have a loss of earnings or loss of earning capacity for three years, and that the sum of <damage type = "other">$38,672.64</damage> represents the difference between what she could have earned had she stayed at the BCLC, and what she presently earns at the Municipality of Delta.
122  The plaintiff has now almost completely recovered. I accept that she has some minimal ongoing restrictions, including an inability to drive for extended periods of time. However, she is otherwise unrestricted in terms of work capacity. Her condition is likely to continue to improve.
123  I accept that she continues to suffer some minor loss of earning capacity, based upon the factors set out in Brown v. Golaiy  (S.C.). I do not accept that the amount as calculated by the plaintiff represents an appropriate measure of the loss of earning capacity. The salary that she would have had at BCLC is <damage type = "other">$50,000</damage>, and there was a potential for a bonus of up to 11.25% of salary. In my view, <damage type = "future wage loss">$20,000</damage> represents an appropriate award for the earning capacity restriction that the plaintiff has suffered. This represents something slightly more than a third of the annual gross pay that she could have earned at BCLC, or in other words, is equivalent to roughly four months of full-time pay at the position she was forced to leave.
In-trust claim - common-law husband Brian King
124  At the time of the accident, Ms. Najdychor's common-law husband, Brian King, was self-employed as a painting and decorating contractor. He said his business was very busy at that time. He has a crew of four to eight workers. His personal charge-out rate in 2006 was <damage type = "other">$50</damage> per hour. Immediately after the accident, he stayed home to care for his wife, for a week. The charge-out rate for his experienced workers was then <damage type = "other">$22</damage> to <damage type = "other">$25</damage> per hour, and a helper would be charged out at <damage type = "other">$15</damage> to <damage type = "other">$17</damage> per hour.
125  Mr. King testified that when he is on the job site, the work can move from 20 to 50% faster, because he himself is a very efficient worker and he, being the boss, is on site to make sure the work is carried out quickly. His profitability is based upon how quickly he can do the work.
126  The defence argued that Mr. King should have employed temporary help in his business, or Ms. Najdychor ought to have employed homecare, rather than having Mr. King suffer a loss in his business as claimed. These alternatives are impractical. In any event, some in-trust or special damages claims would have resulted.
127  I am satisfied that the in-trust claim is appropriate, and that Mr. King suffered a real loss of business and income as a result of the need for him to stay at home to look after his wife for a week after the accident. Estimating the loss is difficult and of necessity an imprecise exercise. The plaintiff has estimated the value of Mr. King's daily income at <damage type = "other">$360</damage>. This is a reasonable and indeed modest estimate. The in-trust claim will be allowed in the sum of <damage type = "in trust">$1,800</damage>, based upon the loss of five working days.
Summary of conclusions
128  The plaintiff will receive compensation from the defendants as follows:
Non-pecuniary loss: <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$59,000</damage>
(<damage type = "non-pecuniary">$60,000</damage> less <damage type = "reduction by">$1,000</damage> for failure to mitigate);
Special damages <damage type = "special">$6,705.98</damage>;
Cost of future care: nil;
Past income loss: <damage type = "past wage loss">$11,206.76</damage>;
Loss of earning capacity: <damage type = "future wage loss">$20,000</damage>;
In-trust claim: <damage type = "in trust">$1,800</damage>;
TOTAL: <damage type = "total">$98,712.74</damage>
129  The plaintiff will have party and party costs at Scale B subject to submissions of the parties. The parties will be at liberty to make submissions with respect to costs within 30 days of the date of judgment.

Action by Delgiglio for damages for personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. In 2009, the defendant Becker, an RCMP officer, drove her police cruiser through a red light and struck Delgiglio's vehicle. Becker submitted that she attempted to stop her cruiser but the brakes did not work. The defendants took the position that Becker was driving with reasonable care and was not negligent or liable for any damage suffered by Delgiglio. Delgiglio took the position that Becker did nothing to avoid the accident and was therefore negligent and caused the accident. Delgiglio had pre-existing medical conditions and had been in previous motor vehicle accidents. 

HELD: Action allowed.
 Becker took no steps to avoid the collision or to warn Delgiglio that she could not stop. No mechanical defect or malfunction was found when the cruiser was examined. Becker was therefore negligent and the defendants were liable for the accident. By the time of the 2009 accident, Delgiglio had returned to work full-time and had returned to his baseline level of pain since his previous accident. The injuries from the previous accident were divisible from those sustained in the 2009 accident. Delgiglio suffered a re-aggravation of a neck and lower back injury and had reached a plateau in his recovery. The injuries had a significant impact on his life and he was now unfit to pursue his career in truck driving. Delgiglio was awarded <damage type = "total">$331,868</damage> in damages, which included <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$80,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages, <damage type = "past wage loss">$74,291</damage> for past wage loss, <damage type = "future wage loss">$150,000</damage> for loss of future earning capacity, <damage type = "future care">$25,000</damage> for the cost of future care and <damage type = "special">$2,577</damage> in special damages.

J.M. GROPPER J.
Introduction
1  On January 6, 2009, Mr. Del Giglio was on his way home from work at approximately 1:30 a.m. He was driving his 2002 Chevy Silverado truck north on Clarke Road toward the intersection at Smith Street in Coquitlam, British Columbia. He had a green light.
2  Constable Melissa Becker was driving her RCMP police cruiser travelling west on Smith Street. Although she faced a red light, she went through the intersection without stopping and hit the plaintiff's vehicle. Liability is in dispute.
3  Mr. Del Giglio asserts that he suffered injuries because of the accident and claims non-pecuniary damages, past loss of income, future loss of earning capacity, costs of future care and special damages.
Liability
4  Although Constable Becker went through a red light, she maintains that the plaintiff has not proven that she is liable for the accident.
5  Constable Becker says that she was on her way to a restaurant on her lunch break during her shift at around 1:30 a.m. on January 6, 2009. She was going with her partner, Constable Farwaha who was immediately behind her in his police cruiser.
6  Constable Becker says Clarke Road and Smith Street were both plowed. It was not raining. The temperature was about zero. She had driven Clarke Road and Smith Street earlier in the evening and had no difficulty driving. She drove from the police station half a block east of the Clarke and Smith intersection and as she turned onto Smith, she says she noticed that the light at the intersection was red. She used her brakes to slow down and it was her intention to come to a full stop. She says she put her foot on the brake but her cruiser was not slowing down or stopping as she expected. She thought that she was sliding although she was going straight. She says it did not feel like she was on black ice.
7  Constable Becker says she was travelling at a very low speed although she was not keeping track. She took her foot off the gas and when she got to the left-hand turn lane before the intersection, she applied her brake. She kept both feet on the brake pedal and pressed as hard as she could. She says the cruiser seemed to slow down with gravity and she thought it would come to a complete stop at the intersection. She estimates that she attempted to stop her cruiser when it was about 150 feet before the intersection at Clarke Road and slid for about 30 seconds. She saw Mr. Del Giglio's truck either coming into or in the intersection. After she saw the truck, she looked down at her feet on the brake. She hoped that the brakes would start to work. She says she was convinced that the cruiser would stop before the intersection.
8  Constable Becker considered that her ABS brake system was not working. She says that when she realized that she radioed her partner to say that she could not stop. She saw Mr. Del Giglio's truck northbound on Clark. She put on her seatbelt and the emergency lights. She says that the cruiser did not stop. Her cruiser stopped as she and the plaintiff's vehicle collided. She did not recall feeling a jerk.
9  Constable Becker says that she did not think of steering to the right or left to attempt to avoid the plaintiff's vehicle. She did not try to shift gears; she did not engage the emergency brake; she did not sound the siren or honk the horn.
10  Mr. Del Giglio says that he was driving north on Clarke Road. The road was wet but not slippery; there was snow and slush at the side of the road. He says he was driving under the speed limit. As he approached the intersection, he had a green light. He says when he was in the intersection the police cruiser went through the red light and "t-boned" his truck. It spun it around until it was facing eastbound. He says that the cruiser ended up in the oncoming lane of traffic (south of the intersection). Mr. Del Giglio says that at the last second he swerved left when he realized the cruiser was going to hit his vehicle. It was too late.
11  Following the accident Constable Becker went to the plaintiff's vehicle to talk to him. She did not inspect the intersection. She walked back up the left turn lane she had previously driven on Smith Street to another police cruiser. She did not have any difficulty walking and did not observe any black ice.
12  The defence called evidence that the cruiser was serviced regularly. There was no mechanical defect or malfunction of the brakes observed when the cruiser was inspected after the accident.
Position of the Parties
13  Mr. Del Giglio maintains that Constable Becker was negligent and caused the accident. Even though she says that she was travelling at a very low speed, her cruiser slid over 150 feet through a red light, into the intersection where it collided with Mr. Del Giglio's truck.
14  Mr. Del Giglio says that Constable Becker did not do anything to avoid the accident. She did not pump or release her brakes, steer out of the slide, drive into the adjacent lane or to the curb, change gears, or make any attempt to regain control of the vehicle. She did not sound the siren or the horn.
15  Mr. Del Giglio observes that Constable Becker did not say that she had encountered black ice. She did not have any difficulty walking back up the left-turn lane that her cruiser had travelled when she could not stop. If she maintains that the road was slippery, her partner, Constable Farwaha, could have corroborated her evidence but he was not called to give evidence. He asserts that an adverse inference should be drawn from the defendants' failure to call Constable Farwaha.
16  The defendants assert that Constable Becker was driving with reasonable care and is not liable and negligent for any damage suffered by the plaintiff. The defendants say that merely because a motor vehicle accident has occurred, it does not necessarily follow that negligence is involved: Goodwin v. Goodwin et al,  at para 30. Relying on Nason v. Nunes,  at para. 14, the defendants assert that because Constable Becker has shown that she drove with reasonable care she cannot be found liable for the accident, even if she is not able to explain how it happened.
17  The defendants argue that the circumstances in the early morning hours of January 6, 2009, were those of poor road and weather conditions. In that context, they argue, Constable Becker took all reasonable precautions and did not depart from a reasonable standard of care. The precautions that she took included driving at a very low speed, applying the brakes and continuing to step firmly on them so that the cruiser's anti-lock braking system would effectively stop her vehicle, advising her partner that she could not stop, buckling her seatbelt and activating the emergency lights. Constable Becker's trust in her anti-lock braking system was reasonable and it was reasonable for her to believe that she would stop before she went into the intersection.
Discussion
18  The defendants rely on a series of cases where the court declined to find liability where the defendant demonstrated that his or her driving was reasonable, but because of icy conditions, was unable to control the vehicle, which slid out of control. The principle was discussed in Nason at para. 14:
Wherever the court finds on all the evidence that negligence has not been proven, or that the defendant has shown he drove with reasonable care, the defendant must succeed, whether or not he is able to "explain" how the accident occurred. This is not to suggest that an inference may not be drawn as a matter of fact in a particular case, where a vehicle leaves the road or a driver loses control; but as the trial judge states ... such an inference will be "highly dependent on the facts" of the case and the explanation required to rebut it will "vary in accordance with the strength of the inference sought to be drawn by the plaintiff."
[emphasis in original]
19  In Bhangal v. Sloan, , the court confirmed a jury award which found no negligence on the defendant's part, after hearing his evidence about what he did where the road was icy and he could not stop. The defendant in that case checked his brakes three times before he came to the stop sign, did not drive over 20 kilometres an hour, kept pumping the brakes, honked his horn, flashed his high and low beams, put his hazard lights on, tried to steer into the ditch, tried to put the gear in reverse and applied his emergency break.
20  Constable Becker's evidence did not confirm that the road conditions were icy or slippery; she specifically said that she did not consider that she was slipping on black ice and had no difficulty walking up the left-turn lane which she had earlier driven in her police cruiser. Her faith in her braking system was not sufficient to avoid a collision. Constable Becker did not take any steps to avoid travelling through the intersection on a red light or colliding with the plaintiff's vehicle. She did not take any steps to warn the plaintiff that she could not stop. Putting on her seatbelt and radioing her partner are unhelpful in warning Mr. Del Giglio that she would be entering the intersection on a red light. Putting on her emergency lights may have alerted Mr. Del Giglio to her cruiser but would not warn him that she could not stop.
21  Constable Becker says that her anti-lock braking system was not effective in stopping the cruiser. I cannot accept that evidence in light of the defendants' other evidence from the detachment's fleet mechanic, Gerald Brown, that no mechanical defect or malfunction of the brakes was found when the cruiser was examined after the accident. Constable Becker's explanations of the cause of her going through the red light are not based on the evidence, neither her own or that of Mr. Brown.
22  Constable Becker's reaction, when she saw Mr. Del Giglio's truck entering or in the intersection, was not reasonable; she did nothing that would avoid the collision. It is unnecessary to draw an adverse inference from the defendant's failure to call Constable Farwaha as a witness. The defendants' own evidence is sufficient to disprove Constable Becker's explanation of how the accident occurred.
23  I have no hesitation in determining that Constable Becker was negligent and the defendants are therefore liable for the motor vehicle accident.
24  The defendants also assert that the plaintiff's failure to stop his own vehicle in the circumstances fell below the standard of a reasonable driver and constitute negligence. Mr. Del Giglio says that he accelerated or perhaps he braked; he did what he could to avoid Constable Becker's cruiser when, seconds before the impact, it appeared that she was not stopping at the red light. I cannot conclude that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent in the circumstances.
The Evidence
Before the accident
Health
25  Mr. Del Giglio is presently 57 years of age. He has a checkered medical history, complicated by seven motor vehicle accidents before that of January 6, 2009.
26  Mr. Del Giglio also has degenerative back conditions including diffused idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH Syndrome) and degenerative disc disease. He has lymphedema in his lower right leg, which requires him to wear a leg brace, and a meniscus tear to his left knee. He is obese and de-conditioned. He has severe sleep apnea which he manages with a sleep mask.
27  On April 24, 1988, Mr. Del Giglio was rear-ended while he was stopped at a red light in Maple Ridge. He suffered injuries to his back and neck. As a result of this he had a lumbar fusion in 1991. Mr. Del Giglio had an improvement in his level of pain after the surgery but was left with persistent back symptomology.
28  Mr. Del Giglio commenced an action in respect of the 1988 accident. Judgment was rendered by Mr. Justice Boyle on June 10, 1993. The decision is indexed as . Damages for non pecuniary loss were assessed at <damage type = "other">$70,000</damage>.
29  The dates of the other motor vehicle accidents are July 30, 1997, February 9, 1999, June 21, 2002, November 6, 2002, January 30, 2003 and May 26, 2008. Those accidents were minor rear-end collisions which resulted in a temporary aggravation of neck and back pain. Mr. Del Giglio says that after each he returned to his post 1988 pain baseline level.
30  The May 2008 accident caused a strain to Mr. Del Giglio's lumbar spine and to his neck. When he saw his family physician, Dr. Brian Monk, on November 25, 2008, he complained of some back pain after a day's work, but he was able to work full time. Dr. Monks treated Mr. Del Giglio for the injuries sustained in the May 2008 accident. He felt that accident caused low back strain and aggravation of a pre-existing degenerative disc disease. In his evidence, Dr. Monks says when he asked Mr. Del Giglio what his state of recovery was from the May 2008 accident, Mr. Del Giglio said that he was 90% recovered from this accident and back to work as a truck driver when he was involved in a subsequent collision on January 6, 2009.
Work
31  Mr. Del Giglio has worked steadily since he left high school. From 1972 to 1974 he worked with the BC Forest Service. In 1974 he began work as a truck driver with CP Transportation doing bulk and heavy haul. From 1978 until 1988 he was steadily employed by Arrow Transport Ltd. By 1988 he was earning approximately <damage type = "other">$70,000</damage> per year.
32  The 1988 accident prevented him from returning to his previous work as a long haul truck driver. He could not lift as he had before or tolerate prolonged periods of sitting. He was sensitive to rough rides in a poorly suspended vehicle.
33  Boyle J. assessed his past wage loss at <damage type = "other">$286,000</damage>, pension loss at $46,400 and future wage loss at <damage type = "other">$421,940</damage>. He determined that Mr. Del Giglio was not totally disabled from work and applied a 25% contingency. His conclusion in regard to future wage loss is stated at paras. 151-152 and 156-158:
No one disputes the Plaintiff had a phenomenal work record. He worked every hour he could get. He took virtually no time off. He was censured for certain lack of professional care on a few occasions but I did not conclude these were relevant to past or future wage loss. He was about mid-way on the seniority list and member of a strong union. If he returned, he would retain that seniority.
There are lighter, local, four-days-on/ four-days-off jobs at the trucking firm (Gunn evidence). They are not as high paying as the Seattle run and they are not free of loading and unloading but some delivery points have hydraulic aids. It seemed to me the Plaintiff did not give a job of this kind his best shot.
...
Nevertheless, assessing past loss of income, some deduction must be made to signal the conclusion that the Plaintiff has not come to grips with the fact of long term persistence of symptomatology that will have to be borne bravely. That is to say, he should have mitigated his losses by pursuit of employment at a level of tolerable activity. He has not done that in a practical way. He should have turned to his union for advice and help. I was not convinced that local light truck driving was beyond his physical reach. His evidence of contact with his former employer and of a gravel truck ride to test his back, did not seem to me to cover all potential opportunities nor to be more than perfunctory.
Had he diligently sought retraining, it would be fair to say there should be no negative contingency but he did not. The Plaintiff did not do well in school. I do not know why not. His evidence sounded to be that of an intelligent, articulate person. His spacial and mechanical reasoning ability was found by occupational consultant, William R. Kelley, to be in the top one-third of men.
34  Of the <damage type = "other">$65,000</damage> per year that he had earned, Boyle J. determined that his loss was <damage type = "other">$29,000</damage> annually, calculated to age 65 for its present value. He applied a 20% deduction for contingencies on the award for future loss of earnings.
35  As he recovered from his injuries from the 1988 accident, Mr. Del Giglio began playing guitar. In the spring of 1991 he joined a band or performed as a freelance guitarist. In 1996 he began to play lead guitar with the Ken McCoy Band The band plays locally and occasionally travels. They were playing three to four nights a week in the late 90's, but now the band plays one to three nights a week,
36  In October 2005, Mr. Del Giglio took a job at J.D.P. Holdings. The work involved driving short haul and required no significant lifting or carrying. The trucks operated by J.D.P. are relatively new and have better suspension than the trucks he operated before 1988.
37  Mr. Del Giglio worked a regular afternoon shift. His job provided flexible hours and accommodated his music career. Mr. Del Giglio says that he missed three months of work from J.D.P. Holdings as a result of his May 2008 accident. He returned to work full-time and to his full-time regular duties at the beginning of September 2008 and was working on that basis when the January 2009 accident occurred.
The Accident
38  The impact to Mr. Del Giglio's vehicle in the accident was to the passenger door and down the side of the vehicle to the rear tire. The cost of repairs was over <damage type = "other">$8,200</damage>.
39  Mr. Del Giglio says that shortly after the accident he began to feel a burning sensation in his lower back, pain in his neck and a headache. Mr. Del Giglio also injured his right elbow and right hand.
After the Accident
40  Mr. Del Giglio went to see Dr. Monks on the day of the accident. Dr. Monks observed that Mr. Del Giglio's lower para-dorsal muscles were very tender on palpation and he complained of significant pain with weight rotation. Dr. Monks diagnosed a strain to his lumbar spine and to his neck. He advised Tylenol and Advil for pain and inflammation and referred Mr. Del Giglio to physiotherapy.
41  The hand pain lasted two weeks and the elbow pain resolved around the same time. Dr. Monks' reports describe Mr. Del Giglio's ongoing pain and restriction of movement in his back which continues. Mr. De Giglio says he suffers from headaches which started shortly after the accident. They arise from his neck injury. He has taken pain killers and anti-inflammatory medication to treat the headaches. The pain varies in strength. He gets them four to ten times a month and can last as long as a day. He says he also suffers from dizziness.
42  Mr. Del Giglio complains of a burning-type sensation and tightening in his neck at the back and on both sides radiating up the back of his head. The neck pain increased the day after the accident and then got much worse. It was only after attending at physiotherapy that the neck pain began to subside.
43  Mr. Del Giglio attended physiotherapy upon his doctor's advice from February 2009 until December 2009, two days a week. He has daily pain and continues to have a limited range of motion.
Current Situation
Health
44  Mr. Del Giglio continues to have pain in his lower back. It's varies with what activities he has undertaken. Mr. Del Giglio says that his previous (before the January 2009 accident) back pain did not occur on a daily basis and did not prevent him from doing whatever he wanted to do. This back pain is different. His back is aggravated by sitting too long, getting dressed in the morning and immediately after sleep. It is painful for Mr Del Giglio to get out of bed and get in and out of the car. Physiotherapy was of some help that did not return Mr. Del Giglio to his previous level of function. His headaches and mid back flare-up from time to time, but those symptoms have improved.
45  Mr. Del Giglio says that he has also suffered emotional difficulties and depression symptoms. He is grouchy and negative and depressed about not being able to do what he wishes because of the pain. He feels he lacks focus: he has difficulty remembering upcoming events and does not retain information. He relies on his wife to remind him of appointments. Mr. Del Giglio also has continuing problems with sleeping: when the pain medication wears off the back pain wakes him up.
46  Mr. Del Giglio is overweight. He has attempted to achieve weight loss through dieting. He has changed his eating habits but finds it difficult to exercise to burn calories. Mr. Del Giglio is interested in attending a weight-loss clinic and a dietitian consult.
47  Mr. Del Giglio's physicians have recommended continuing with physiotherapy. He continues to utilize ibuprofen, Advil and aspirin on a frequent basis.
Work
48  Mr. Del Giglio has not been able to return to work as a truck driver at J.D.P. Holdings Ltd. He is unable to fulfill the duties of the job which includes prolonged sitting, bending and twisting and other physical aspects. His job remains open. Paul Caravetta, the owner of J.D.P., confirms that he has a demand for drivers and would continue to employ Mr. Del Giglio in the future as long as he wanted if he if he was able and willing to drive. He says there are no less physically demanding jobs at his company.
49  Mr. Del Giglio has attempted to return to work in other capacities. He worked one shift as a security guard but the lymphedema in his leg impaired his mobility and caused his hospitalization the next day. He has attempted to teach music and repair guitars but neither has proven to be successful.
50  Mr. Del Giglio continues to play with the Ken McCoy band. He does not claim any wage loss related to his musical career. He has been able to continue to work with the band and sustain his earnings. Others in the band have had to accommodate Mr. Del Giglio's inability to lift or move heavy items.
Medical Evidence
Dr. Brian Monks
51  Dr. Monks has been Mr. Del Giglio's family physician since April 2007. He treated Mr. Del Giglio for back pain after the accident of May 26, 2008. He diagnosed a strain to the lumbar spine and recommended ibuprofen and physiotherapy. As stated, when Mr. Del Giglio attended Dr. Monks' office on November 25, 2008 he reported some back pain but described his recovery as 90%.
52  In his medical legal report of November 24, 2009, Dr. Monks was of the opinion that the accident of January 6, 2009 caused strain to Mr. Del Giglio's neck and upper and lower back. He says "the impact also caused an aggravation of his pre-existing degenerative disc disease in his cervical and lumbar spines." He continues:
It is now almost 11 months since [the January 2009] accident which I believe is his eighth accident. This one may well be the one that is most serious as it appears unlikely that he will be able to return to his job as a truck driver. He really has made very little progress over the last six months. I would support Mr. Del Giglio's idea that he should train for different work ...
53  Dr. Monks provided a report on April 25, 2011 after his examination of Mr. Del Giglio on March 28, 2011. Mr. Del Giglio informed him that there was no improvement in the six months prior to that appointment. His sitting was limited, household chores aggravated his back pain and performing the duties associated with being a truck driver aggravated his low back pain. Walking did not cause a problem. In that medical legal report Dr. Monks says: "I believe that the last of his many accidents has tipped the scales to render Mr. Del Giglio medically unfit to return to his former job safely."
54  Dr. Monks did not diagnose Mr. Del Giglio to be suffering from depression.
Dr. G.M. McKenzie
55  Dr. McKenzie is an orthopedic surgeon. At the request of his counsel, he examined Mr. Del Giglio on October 7, 2009 and May 4, 2011. Dr. McKenzie had also assessed Mr. Del Giglio after two previous accidents on April 2004 and October 2005.
56  In his medical legal report of October 7, 2009, Dr. McKenzie stated:
With the May 26, 2008 accident in my opinion, he aggravated his neck and back problems. It sounds by his history that those reverted back to his baseline neck and lower back pain prior to his most recent motor vehicle accident January 6, 2009.
In January 2009, in my opinion he again aggravated his neck and lower back. Comparing his neck complaints today to his neck complaints prior to his June 2002 accident and January 2003 accident it sounds quite similar to what he describes now. In my opinion his most recent accident although aggravating his neck pain is unlikely to give him any long term residual effects. In my opinion he has almost returned back to his baseline pre-accident neck pain and in fact may have reached that situation now.
In my opinion the January 6, 2009 accident also aggravated his lower back pain. By his history he still seems to be somewhat worse in his lower back and prior to this motor vehicle accident but it is very similar to the pain complaints that I documented in my last visit with him October 26, 2005.
57  Dr. McKenzie considered that Mr. Del Giglio had returned to work after each accident but after the January 2009 accident he was no longer working as a truck driver. Nevertheless, Dr. McKenzie felt that Mr. Del Giglio's progress for improvement was good.
58  In his medical report of May 4, 2011, Dr. McKenzie related Mr. Del Giglio's complaints of back and neck pain. Dr. McKenzie asked Mr. Del Giglio which accident, May 2008 or January 2009, was most significant. Mr. Del Giglio felt he was almost back to its baseline level of pain after the May 2008 accident. After the January 2009 accident, Mr. Del Giglio said that he could not return to his previous activities and stated "I could get past the pain before but not now."
59  Dr. McKenzie considered that the May 2008 accident caused a "transient aggravation of his pre-existing problems ... [t]hat accident will not give him any long-term problems in his neck and lower back." Dr. McKenzie's opinion is that the January 2009 accident aggravated his pre-existing condition. Dr. McKenzie also considers it Mr. Del Giglio "to be quite susceptible to injury in his neck and back as he had previously significant degenerative changes in the neck and lower back."
60  Dr. McKenzie considered that Mr. Del Giglio's prognosis for improvement was good when he saw him in October 2009. He acknowledges that this prognosis has not proven to be the case and that Mr. Del Giglio had plateaued. Nevertheless Dr. McKenzie suggests that Mr. to Giglio may show some further improvement but the prognosis would be "guarded at best."
61  In his evidence, Dr. McKenzie says:
My main opinion was largely unchanged. I concluded that without the accident [of January 2009], he may have had problems anyway but the accident precipitated this at an earlier rate and it would be impossible to say how much earlier.
He would likely have problems with his ongoing problems and increasing age. The cervical spine injury --the disc tends to dry up and narrow and you can get associated changes which is not uncommon, but we don't know if it would cause any pain. There is no predicative value to whether it will cause pain. Same in the lower back area - same loss of disc space.
62  Dr. McKenzie does not consider Mr. Del Giglio to be totally disabled. He is partially disabled particularly in regard to returning to work as a truck driver.
Dr. J. Purtzki
63  Dr. Purtzki is a physical medicine and rehabilitation consultant. She examined Mr. Del Giglio at the request of his counsel on July 8, 2011. Her medical legal report of July 11, 2011, describes the injuries caused by the January 2009 accident; the nature and extent of any probable or possible residual disability; and any recommendation for treatment in the future. She refers to Mr. Del Giglio describing that he feels "somewhat depressed ... related to chronic pain and a change in his lifestyle ... [and] that he is worried and stressed ... related mainly to his finances."
64  Dr. Purtzki's opinion is that the January 2009 accident aggravated Mr. Del Giglio's pre-existing degenerative changes in his neck and lower back. She recommended that he engage in core strengthening exercises, physiotherapy, diagnostic and therapeutic injections, weight loss with a dietitian consult and the use of regular anti-inflammatory medication.
65  Dr. Purtzki considers that Mr. Del Giglio is "suffering from low-grade depression since the MVA with increased stressors" and "think[s] his presentation is due to chronic pain and adverse life circumstances." She recommends counseling for depression.
66  In her evidence, Dr. Purtzki says that Mr. Del Giglio's lymphedema in his right calf adversely affected mobility and may worsen his back pain. Mr. Del Giglio's excess weight was counterproductive to good spinal mobility and core strength. His Dish syndrome makes the spine immobile.
Functional & Vocational Evidence
Paul Pakulak
67  Paul Pakulak is an occupational therapist. He conducted a functional capacity assessment of Mr. Del Giglio. Mr. Del Giglio demonstrated the capacity for activity requiring modified medium light level strength. He has specific limitations related to prolonged and repetitive below waist level work, overhead work and sitting. Prolonged activity above the medium-light level will adversely impact his productivity and safety.
68  Mr. Pakulak considers Mr. Del Giglio's overall capacity to compete for work in the open job market has been reduced. He cannot continue in his previous work as a truck driver.
Derek Nordin
69  Mr. Norton completed of vocational assessment and Mr. Del Giglio on October 27, 2010. He conducted a battery of tests to gauge Mr. Del Giglio's academic achievement and intellect. He does not recommend retraining. He considers that Mr. Del Giglio age and ongoing back problems, limited experience in jobs other than truck driving are barriers to Mr. Del Giglio's successfully marketing himself to a new field in competition with younger and more able-bodied competitors.
Natalia Allende
70  Ms. Allende is also an occupational therapist. She completed a cost of future care assessment at the Del Giglio household, on September 9, 2011. She recommends one-time care costs for physiotherapy/kinesiology, the healthy heart program, dietitian, psychological and occupational therapy amounting to <damage type = "other">$3,537</damage>-<damage type = "other">$6,611</damage>. The annual care costs include a gym membership, home maintenance, housekeeping and non-prescription medications amounting to <damage type = "other">$1,859.85</damage> - <damage type = "other">$2,897.92</damage> annually.
Causation
Position of the Parties
71  The plaintiff's position is that he suffered a re-aggravation of his neck and lower back pain in the January 2009 accident. While there was some initial improvement with physiotherapy, Mr. Del Giglio did not return to his previous baseline level of pain. His lower back pain levels have increased and his neck pain has gone from intermittent to constant. He is no longer able to perform the activities associated with driving a truck.
72  The defendants' position on causation is twofold: first they argue that Mr. Del Giglio's injuries from the January 2009 accident and the May 2008 accident are indivisible. Because the plaintiff settled his claim against the driver involved in the May 2008 accident and signed a release, the release releases all other joint tortfeasors, specifically these defendants. Second, they assert that the "crumbling skull" rule applies to Mr. Del Giglio.
The Law
Divisible and Indivisible Injuries
73  Divisible injuries are those which are capable of being separated, such as injuries to different body parts or injuries to which the defendant has not contributed (Bradley v. Groves, , at para. 20; see also Athey v. Leonati, , at paras. 22-25.) Whether damage derived from multiple sources is divisible for the purpose of determining the extent of the liability of one defendant is a question of fact.
74  If the injuries are divisible, the devaluation approach from Long v. Thiessen (1968), 65 W.W.R. 577 at 591 (B.C.C.A.) is the appropriate method for determining the amount of damages that can be attributed to the defendant. This was discussed in Bradley at para. 33:
The approach to apportionment in Long v. Thiessen is therefore no longer applicable to indivisible injuries. The reason is that Long v. Thiessen pre-supposes divisibility: Long requires courts to take a single injury and divide it up into constituent causes or points in time, and assess damages twice; once on the day before the second tort, and once at trial. Each defendant is responsible only for their share of the injury and the plaintiff can recover only the appropriate portion from each tortfeasor.
[emphasis in original]
75  Indivisible injuries are those that cannot be separated, such as aggravation or exacerbation of an earlier injury, an injury to the same area of the body, or global symptoms that are impossible to separate: Bradley, at para. 20; see also Athey, at paras. 22-25.
76  If the injuries are indivisible, the court must apply the "but for" test in respect of the defendant's act. Even though there may be several tortious or non-tortious causes of injury, so long as the defendant's act is a cause, the defendant is fully liable for that damage: Bradley, at paras. 32-37; see also Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke,  at paras. 19-23.
The "Thin Skull" and "Crumbling Skull" Rules
77  A basic principle of damages in tort cases is that "the defendant need not put the plaintiff in a better position than ... his original position and should not compensate the plaintiff for any damages ... he would have suffered anyway": Blackwater v. Plint,  at para. 78; see also Bradley at para. 25. This is known as the "crumbling skull rule": Athey at para. 35; see also Blackwater, at para. 80.
78  On the other hand, the defendant "takes his victim as he finds him": Blackwater, at para. 79. This means, the defendant is "liable for the plaintiff's injuries even if the injuries are unexpectedly severe owing to a pre-existing condition": Athey, at para. 34. This is known as the "thin skull rule": Blackwater, at para. 79.
79  Mr. Del Giglio must establish that the defendants' negligence caused or materially contributed to his injuries. The defendant's negligence need not be the sole cause of the injury as long it is part of the cause: Athey at paras. 13 - 19.
Discussion
80  Mr. Del Giglio advised Dr. Monks in November 2008 that he was 90% recovered from the injuries he sustained in the May 2008 accident. He was back at work full-time. He had returned to his baseline level of pain when the January 2009 accident occurred. His evidence is supported by Dr. Monks who was in contact with Mr. Del Giglio from April 2007, but most particularly between March and November 2008. Dr. Monks was in the best position of all the physicians to assess Mr. Del Giglio's condition before the January 2009 accident. While Dr. Monks relies on Mr. Del Giglio's statement to him concerning his 90% recovery, there really is no better evidence upon which I can rely to determine that his situation was otherwise. It is also supported by other facts, most particularly, that Mr. Del Giglio was working full-time, pursuing his music career and engaging in his normal level of activity.
81  Dr. McKenzie explains that Mr. Del Giglio's injuries from the May 2008 accident were aggravated in the January 2009 accident. Nonetheless, he considers that the May 2008 accident was a "transient aggravation of his pre-existing problems" whereas the January 2009 accident has resulted in a more permanent though partial disability.
82  Dr. McKenzie acknowledges that Mr. Del Giglio would like have developed symptoms associated with his ongoing health problems and increasing age. Nevertheless, Dr. McKenzie is of the view that he could not predict whether these pre-existing problems would cause pain. Dr. Purtzki has referred to the plaintiff's other health problems, including the lymphedema, the DISH syndrome and his weight of as counterproductive to spinal mobility and core strength.
83  I find that the medical evidence supports that the injuries sustained in the May 2008 accident are divisible from those sustained in the January 2009 accident. While Mr. Del Giglio's back was susceptible to injury, the May 2008 accident did not put him in the position which he is in now: restricted from working as a truck driver at all and from many of his normal activities.
84  Because the injuries which Mr. Del Giglio sustained in the May 2008 accident and the January 2009 accident are divisible, I reject the defendants' position that because he settled his claim against the driver involved in the May 2008 accident and signed a release that he has released all other joint tortfeasors, specifically these defendants.
85  In respect of the defendants' assertion that the crumbling skull condition applies, the plaintiff has established that he had a baseline which was not free of pain, but had a manageable amount of pain. There is no evidence that he was worsening or deteriorating before the motor vehicle accident from that baseline. Dr. McKenzie agrees that with his ongoing problems and increasing age he may have had problems anyway. His opinion was that the accident precipitated this at an earlier rate but he could not say how much earlier.
86  I am satisfied that Mr. Del Giglio's current symptoms would not be present, but for the accident of January 6, 2009. I accept that Mr. Del Giglio has challenging health issues; he was able to function at his baseline level with a manageable amount of pain. While there may have been deterioration in his ability to function as he aged, the evidence satisfies me that the accident of January 6, 2009 caused the abrupt physical and mental decline that Mr. Del Giglio experienced.
Damages
Duty to Mitigate
87  Once the plaintiff establishes that the defendant is liable for his injuries, the burden shifts to the defendant. In order to prove that the plaintiff did not meet his duty to mitigate, the defence must prove that he acted unreasonably and that reasonable conduct would have reduced or eliminated the loss. Whether the plaintiff acted reasonably is a factual question: Gilbert v. Bottle,  at para. 202. Gilbert continues at para. 203:
A relevant circumstance in cases such as this is the plaintiff's personality and condition before and after the accident. The law does not require a plaintiff to do that which cannot be controlled, nor does it require perfection in the pursuit of rehabilitation. In addition, the defendant must take the victim as found, which may affect what is to be reasonably expected. For example, a person who has struggled with life-long obesity may not be expected to lose substantial weight to discharge the duty to mitigate, even though weight loss would assist recovery. What the law requires is that the plaintiff makes contextually reasonable and sincere efforts to limit his or her damages and loss [citations omitted].
[emphasis added]
88  The evidence is clear that Mr. Del Giglio has struggled with lifelong obesity. He has attempted to lose weight in accordance with his doctor's advice and has been somewhat successful. The plaintiff asserts that with assistance, including physiotherapy, kinesiology, the healthy heart program, a dietician and a gym membership he will likely lose weight and build his core strength.
89  I find that Mr. Del Giglio has made "contextually reasonable and sincere efforts" to lose weight, but would benefit considerably from professional assistance. I disagree with the defendants that his damages should be reduced to reflect his reflected failure to mitigate. The defendants have not proven a failure to mitigate.
Non-Pecuniary Damages
90  Non-pecuniary damages are awarded to compensate the plaintiff for pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of amenities. Many cases refer to a list of factors (Stapley v. Hejslet,  at para. 46), which generally address the plaintiff's age, the nature of the injury, the severity and duration of the pain, the level of the disability and the loss of lifestyle or impairment of life. The compensation should be fair to all parties and fairness is measured against all awards made in comparable cases which provide general guidance. Each case must be decided on its own facts.
91  The evidence supports, and I have found, that Mr. Del Giglio suffered a re-aggravation of his neck and lower back pain in the January 2009 accident. He has reached a plateau in his recovery. He has not returned to his baseline level of activity which he enjoyed before the accident. He has not returned to his pre-accident level of pain. Though initially optimistic, Mr. Del Giglio's physicians are all of the view that his prognosis is "guarded at best."
92  Mr. Del Giglio has suffered pain and loss of enjoyment of his life. The injuries have had a serve impact. I accept that Mr. Del Giglio's pain has been distressful and have affected his emotional state. Despite Dr. Monk's not having diagnosed depression, Dr. Purtzki did find such symptoms, which are anticipatable, given the reduction in the activities, including the ability to work, which Mr. Del Giglio has experienced.
93  On the other hand, Mr. Del Giglio has been able to maintain his musical career, a vocation that he clearly thrives upon. That is a factor which I will take into account.
94  A further factor is that Mr. Del Giglio is aging and some deterioration in his cervical spine is, in Dr. McKenzie's words, "not uncommon." I accept that he would have had some increased pain at some point, but the accident accelerated the onset.
95  Mr. Del Giglio argues that the non-pecuniary damages should be between <damage type = "other">$72,000</damage> and <damage type = "other">$90,000</damage>. The defendants assert that the decline in Mr. Del Giglio's health was not the result of the soft-tissue injuries he sustained in the January 2009 accident and asserts that non-pecuniary damages should be in the range of between <damage type = "other">$20,000</damage> and <damage type = "other">$30,000</damage>.
96  I have specifically found that the plaintiff's pain is the result of the injuries that he sustained in the January 2009 accident, and that they are not of a mild or moderate nature. The prognosis is that they will continue, likely without abatement, throughout Mr. Del Giglio's life. None of Mr. Del Giglio's physicians suggest that he will have much improvement.
97  Having reviewed the cases provided, I conclude a fair and reasonable award for non-pecuniary damages is <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$80,000</damage>.
Loss of Earning Capacity
Past
98  Mr. Del Giglio is 57 years old. At the time of the accident, in January 2009, he was employed as a truck driver with J.D.P. Holdings Ltd. The evidence of his previous employer, Paul Caravetta, is that he would continue to be employed as long as he was able and willing to drive. There is no alternative work with J.D.P., which could accommodate Mr. Del Giglio's physical limitations.
99  Mr. Del Giglio relies on the evidence of Stephen J. Bush, a chartered accountant, who calculated his past loss of income as <damage type = "other">$91,460</damage> based on the following:
Mr. Del Giglio would have continued driving trucks for J.D.P. Holdings Ltd. during the period between January 6, 2009 and the present;
A reasonable pattern of work, based on his work history prior to the accident and the availability of work, would have been 142 hours per month;
The hourly rate of pay during the period would be <damage type = "other">$19.75</damage>, or <damage type = "other">$20.54</damage> including 4% holiday pay;
Mr. Del Giglio would work 11 months per year; and
The tax calculations are made by applying the appropriate marginal tax rate to the pre-tax loss determined each year in the loss period.
100  On that basis, Mr. Del Giglio's pre-tax wage loss would be <damage type = "other">$91,460</damage> and his after tax wage loss would be <damage type = "other">$74,291</damage>.
101  The defendants submit that the plaintiff is not entitled to any income claimed to have been lost because of the accident. The defendants submit that Mr. Del Giglio has already been compensated for loss of his truck driving income in the earlier trial judgment of Boyle J.
102  I accept the plaintiff's calculation of Mr. Del Giglio's past loss of income. He was not compensated for that loss in the decision of Boyle J. in 1993.
103  As I have pointed out, in para. 33 above, Boyle J. assessed Mr. Del Giglio's past loss of income related only to his long-haul truck driving. He did not compensate Mr. Del Giglio for a total disability from truck driving. He explicitly found that "local like truck driving was [within] his physical reach." As it happened, Boyle J. was accurate in his assessment. Mr. Del Giglio was able to return to truck driving and did so in 2005, when he took a regular job at J.D.P. Holdings Ltd.
104  I therefore award Mr. Del Giglio, in accordance with s. 98 of the Insurance (Vehicle) Act, R.S.B.C. 1966, c. 231, damages reflecting his past net income loss of <damage type = "past wage loss">$74,291</damage>.
Future
105  Mr. Del Giglio's physicians unanimously conclude that the accident of January 6, 2009, has rendered him unfit to pursue his career in truck driving. Mr. Del Giglio has provided evidence of his attempts to find other work, which have been either unsuccessful or un-remunerative.
106  The plaintiff asserts that Mr. Del Giglio's loss of future wages, due to his inability to drive a truck is approximately <damage type = "other">$32,000</damage> per year. Using the multipliers provided by Mr. Robert Carson, a consulting economist, the future loss of income to Mr. Del Giglio's age 65 has a present value of <damage type = "other">$210,496</damage>. The plaintiff argues that an appropriate contingency of 20% should be applied to that future loss of earning capacity.
107  The defendants argue, as they did with past loss of earning capacity, that Mr. Del Giglio has already been compensated for all future loss truck driving income in his personal injury award in 1993. The defendants say that the evidence supports that Mr. Del Giglio's can return to truck driving and that any future loss of earning capacity is unreasonable and unfair.
108  A claim for loss of earning capacity raises two questions:
Has the plaintiff's earning capacity been impaired by his injuries;
If so, what compensation should be awarded for the resulting financial harm that will accrue over time?
109  This requires an assessment of damages, not a mathematical calculation.
110  There are two approaches to assessment of loss of future earnings capacity described in Perrin v. Lalari,  at para. 32: the earnings approach and capital asset approach. The plaintiff is urging the earnings approach in its submission. It is unnecessary to consider the capital asset approach, as neither party is advocating that approach.
111  In this case, Mr. Del Giglio had a job that would have had continued to employ him as long as he wished, where he could earn a determined rate of pay for a specified number of hours during each calendar year. He has demonstrated that there is a real and substantial possibility of a future income loss: Chang v. Feng, .
112  I assess Mr. Del Giglio's future loss of earning capacity at <damage type = "future wage loss">$150,000</damage>.
Cost of Future Care
113  Mr. Del Giglio relies on the opinion of Ms. Allende, the occupational therapist. She assessed the residual effects of Mr. Del Giglio's injury on his current and future ability to function independently at his home. She made several recommendations including those to which I have already referred.
114  The defendants say that Mr. Del Giglio is not entitled to any future cost of care award on the basis that the plaintiff stated that he felt that the best therapy for his back was walking his dogs. The defendants also suggest that Ms. Allende assumed that Mr. Del Giglio had no limitations in function before the January 2009 accident, which the defendants assert is incorrect.
115  The plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the cost of future care based on what is reasonably necessary to restore him to his pre-accident condition so far as that is possible. The court must assure full compensation through the provision of adequate future care based on what is reasonably necessary on the medical evidence: Gilbert para. 250.
116  I am satisfied that the medical evidence, particularly that of Dr. Purtzki supports an award as calculated by Ms. Allende. There is no other evidence before me concerning future care costs.
117  I therefore award one-time costs to include physiotherapy, kinesiology, healthy heart program (YMCA), dietician, psychology and occupational therapy, at <damage type = "other">$5,000</damage>; annual care costs including gym membership, home maintenance, housekeeping and non -prescription medications at <damage type = "other">$2,000</damage> annually. A calculation of that cost exceeds the award which the plaintiff seeks under this head of damage which is <damage type = "other">$25,000</damage>. I assess damages for cost of future care as <damage type = "future care">$25,000</damage>.
Special Damages
118  Mr. Del Giglio claims a total of <damage type = "other">$3,110.71</damage> in special damages. Of that, he claims <damage type = "other">$1,067.90</damage> for moving and temporary storage charges. The move occurred in January 2009, a few weeks after the accident. Mr. Del Giglio could have done the move himself with a couple of friends and a truck he would have borrowed from his employer. He could not do that because of the injuries he sustained in the January 2009 accident. He also sustained expenses for storage.
119  I allow special damages in the amount of <damage type = "special">$2,577</damage> which reflects those that are claimed and half of the moving expenses. I cannot find that the storage fees are attributable to the accident.
Summary
120  The defendants are liable for the accident of January 6, 2009.
121  Damages are assessed as follows:
 Non-Pecuniary Damages: <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$80,000.00</damage> 
 Past Wage Loss: <damage type = "past wage loss">$74,291.00</damage> 
 Future Loss of Earning Capacity: <damage type = "future wage loss">$150,000.00</damage> 
 Cost of Future Care: <damage type = "future care">$25,000.00</damage> 
 Special Damages: <damage type = "special">$2,577.00</damage> 
 TOTAL: <damage type = "total">$331,868.00</damage> 
122  Mr. Del Giglio is entitled to his costs. If there are matters which I ought to consider in regard to costs, the parties may appear to address those matters.

Action for damages for battery. A neighbour observed the defendant's son and a friend playing near the plaintiff's bike park and was concerned they were damaging it, so told the boys to leave and called the plaintiff. When the plaintiff came home, he went to investigate and saw the boys on the corner of his property again. The plaintiff testified he told the boys to leave, and then heard "don't" and saw the defendant approaching. The plaintiff testified he said "you must be the dad" and started to explain why he did not want the boys playing there, but the defendant punched him in the side of the head so he was knocked to his knees, and then placed him in a stranglehold and continued punching him and hitting him in the legs until the defendant's wife told the defendant to stop. The defendant testified his son and the friend said a man had threatened to kick their heads in, so he approached the plaintiff and asked if there was a problem with the kids. The defendant testified the plaintiff started yelling at him, pushed him and was about to throw a punch, so the defendant placed the plaintiff in a headlock. The defendant testified the plaintiff slammed him to the ground, but he held on and his wife yelled at him to stop. The defendant testified the plaintiff reached into his pocket so he and his wife ran. The plaintiff claimed he sustained bruising to his left temple, minor injuries to his arm, elbow, and hands, a cataract in his left eye, and injuries to his knees that required a knee replacement of his left knee and would require one for the right. 

HELD: Action allowed in part.
 The plaintiff's version of events was accepted to the extent the defendant approached him angrily, struck him so he fell to his knees and then placed him into a headlock where they had a brief struggle. It was not accepted that the defendant continued to throw punches. The defendant's evidence he approached the plaintiff calmly despite his allegation his son was threatened, and that the plaintiff attacked him was both inconsistent with common sense and the evidence of three witnesses. The defendant also gave conflicting answers about whether he was injured and why he thought the plaintiff reached in his pocket. The defendant's wife claimed she missed the beginning of the fight, which was contrary to witness evidence she was running after the defendant trying to stop him. It was telling that only the plaintiff called the police after the incident. The defendant did not act in defence of himself or anyone else and the plaintiff did nothing to constitute provocation. The 63-year-old plaintiff was a long-haul trucker who worked for 2.5 weeks after the accident, then was off work and then worked sporadically. The plaintiff sustained a meniscus tear to his right knee and also had degenerative arthritis, but the latter was asymptomatic prior to the assault. The plaintiff sustained minor soft tissue injuries and bruising that quickly resolved and an injury to his left eye that was substantially resolved. The plaintiff's left knee injury was pre-existing and he tried to obtain workers' compensation for it just days before the assault. The plaintiff did not establish the assault aggravated his left knee. The plaintiff suffered real injuries and would have continued discomfort, particularly from the future right knee replacement. The plaintiff was awarded <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$70,000</damage> non-pecuniary damages. Considering the plaintiff was actively pursuing workers' compensation at the time of the incident, had other medical issues and a sporadic work history, he was awarded <damage type = "past wage loss">$100,000</damage> past wage loss. It was quite unlikely the plaintiff would have worked to age 70 so he was awarded <damage type = "future wage loss">$45,000</damage> future loss of earnings. The plaintiff was awarded <damage type = "aggravated">$2,500</damage> aggravated damages but there was no basis for punitive damages, and this was not a calculated assault and the award was already substantial. Submissions were needed on the claims under the Crime Victim Assistance Act and Heath Care Costs Recovery Act.

Reasons for Judgment
J.W. WILLIAMS J.
Introduction
1  The plaintiff, William Joseph Rycroft, brings an action alleging the tort of battery. He says that the defendant Nelson Rego wrongfully inflicted physical violence upon him.
2  For the reasons that follow, I rule in Mr. Rycroft's favour.
Background
3  In July 2009, the plaintiff was residing in a rented home located on 227th Street in Maple Ridge, BC. The house is situated on the eastern end of a large parcel of property, with the western portion of that property being, for the most part, an undeveloped acreage. In all, the property is somewhere between 3 and 5 acres in size. The land is owned by a man named Isaaks, who lives in a house located on the western edge of the property. Although he was not a witness to the subject events or a participant in the trial, he was referenced during the course of testimony.
4  There is a 'bike park', as the parties have referred to it, situated on a portion of the property northwest of the plaintiff's home. As I understand it, this is an area where the plaintiff's son and another young man had, some time ago, set up a course for BMX bikes. The park consists of ramps and bridges.
5  The defendant lives with his wife and son in a home located along the southern border of the property. His backyard abuts the property and is separated from it by a small creek. The backyard itself is fairly small, measuring approximately 40 feet by 40 feet.
6  On July 10, 2009, the plaintiff, who was then working as a long-haul trucker, was out of town. That afternoon, he was returning to the Lower Mainland from the interior of the province. He delivered his truck to his employer's depot in Abbottsford, and then drove to his home in his own vehicle, arriving there at approximately 7:30 p.m.
7  Earlier that same day, during the afternoon, the defendant's 12-year-old son, Jordan, was entertaining a friend, Jesse, a young man of the same age who was visiting the Rego residence.
8  At some point, the two boys were apparently playing in the area of the bike park. They were noticed by a neighbour who lived on the south side of the property, approximately halfway between the residences of the plaintiff and the defendant. The neighbour, Peter Henkels, was concerned that the boys were causing damage to the park. As a consequence, he did two things. First, he went on to the property to tell the children to get away from that area. Second, he called the plaintiff on the telephone, advising him that the boys were on the property. The plaintiff explained that he was out of town but that he would be returning later that day.
9  Evidently the boys went home after Mr. Henkels spoke to them.
10  The evidence is that the boys went back to the Rego residence and told Ms. Rego (the defendant's wife) that a man had yelled at them and told them to get off the property. She told the boys to stay home and, initially, they remained inside of the Rego house. Later, they asked to go out and she said that they could, but they had to remain in the yard.
11  A short time later, the plaintiff arrived home. He testified that, shortly before returning home, he had purchased a slurpee beverage. When he arrived home, his first order of business was to walk into the backyard to see if there had been damage to the bike park. He testified that, as he did so, he had the slurpee drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other.
12  What occurred next is a matter of considerable contention. Both parties agree that there was an altercation between the plaintiff and the defendant. However, the specifics of that -- how it came about and what actually took place -- are disputed.
13  A number of witnesses testified about the events leading up to the physical contact between the two men, as well as the altercation itself. In addition to testifying himself, the plaintiff called three of his neighbours as witnesses. Additionally, the plaintiff called evidence relating to the injuries he claims to have sustained and the effects of those injuries upon him, including testimony from his mother.
14  The defendant also testified, and called his wife, his son Jordan, and Jesse, his son's friend, as witnesses.
Issues
15  The issues to be determined in this trial fall into two categories:
Has the plaintiff proven that the defendant committed battery against him?
If the Court is satisfied that the tort of battery has been made out, what injuries and consequences have been proven, and what monetary damages are appropriate?
Positions of the Parties
16  The plaintiff says that the evidence adduced at trial constitutes proof of an unlawful battery. In addition, he submits that no defence, such as self-defence, consent, or provocation, has been made out.
17  The defendant disputes liability. He says that a fair assessment of the evidence should satisfy this Court that he acted in self-defence, and that he used no more force than was proper in the circumstances. The defendant also says that the Court should find that there was consent to the physical encounter between the men, such that the plaintiff is not able to maintain this action. Finally, the defendant submits that this Court should consider whether provocation is a factor in the assessment of liability, although he provided no submissions on that issue.
Analysis and Discussion
Liability for Battery
18  As outlined in Saether v. Irvine,  at paras. 49 and 51-53, the principles that apply to the tort of battery are as follows:
[49] ...Battery is the intentional application of force constituting a harmful or offensive contact with another, without the other's consent.
...
[51] Once the plaintiff has established that there was a battery, and that injuries were caused by it, the defendant has the onus of establishing any defence he may have and, in addition, that the force used was reasonable in the circumstances.
[52] The law does not provide an absolute bar to the use of force. In fact, a party will be permitted to use force where it is taken for the purpose of defending himself or another or in defence of that person's property. However, the force used to effect that defence must not be more than necessary for the purpose at hand: it cannot be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature of the evil sought to be avoided. Where the force used by the defendant falls within that scope, that is, acting in such defence and not of an excessive degree, the defendant will not be liable.
[53] The degree of force used will not be subjected to an especially critical examination: it has been said that the law will not concern itself with niceties in such matters.
The Evidence of Battery
19  In determining liability, my assessments regarding the credibility of the witnesses have substantially informed my analysis.
20  There is significant disparity between the evidence presented on behalf of the plaintiff as compared to that adduced in favour of the defendant. Not surprisingly, each side urges the Court to find that their evidence is straightforward and reliable, and to conclude that the other's case is fraught with flaws and inconsistencies.
21  The factors to be considered when assessing credibility were succinctly summarized in Bradshaw v. Stenner,  at para. 186:
[186] Credibility involves an assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness' testimony based upon the veracity or sincerity of a witness and the accuracy of the evidence that the witness provides (Raymond v. Bosanquet (Township) (1919),  (SCC), ,  (S.C.C.)). The art of assessment involves examination of various factors such as the ability and opportunity to observe events, the firmness of his memory, the ability to resist the influence of interest to modify his recollection, whether the witness' evidence harmonizes with independent evidence that has been accepted, whether the witness changes his testimony during direct and cross-examination, whether the witness' testimony seems unreasonable, impossible, or unlikely, whether a witness has a motive to lie, and the demeanour of a witness generally (Wallace v. Davis,  (Ont.H.C.); Faryna v. Chorny,  (BC CA),  (B.C.C.A.) [Farnya]; R. v. S.(R.D.),  (SCC),  at para.128 (S.C.C.)). Ultimately, the validity of the evidence depends on whether the evidence is consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole and shown to be in existence at the time (Farnya at para. 356).
22  I will commence my analysis by summarizing the testimony of both the plaintiff and the defendant regarding the relevant events.
23  The plaintiff testified that, after he got home and went into the yard, he saw some children in the corner of the property. He said that he told them to leave. He claims that he then started to walk over to investigate whether there was any damage to the bike park. As he was making his way there, he claims he heard a voice say "don't," and then turned to see Mr. and Ms. Rego walking towards him. The plaintiff testified that, after Mr. Rego walked to within 3 to 5 feet of him, he said "you must be the dad; I do not want kids playing there anymore because...," being interrupted mid-sentence by the defendant striking him on the left side of his head. Mr. Rycroft said that, at the time he was struck, his head was turned to the right.
24  The plaintiff testified that he was partially knocked down. Following that, he said that Mr. Rego moved behind him, jumped on his back and put him in a stranglehold. The plaintiff claims that he then went down and that Mr. Rego punched him, He also recalled getting "whacked" on the back of his leg when he tried to stand up. At that point, he said he was on his elbows and knees, and felt the back of his leg being struck again. He testified that he was "freaked out" because he was concerned that the violence was going to trigger his heart arrhythmia. He recalls the defendant's wife yelling "he [the plaintiff] cannot breathe," and that Mr. Rego responding by letting go, running about 5 feet away, and saying words to the effect "do you want round two?" Mr. Rycroft said that his reply was "you bet" but that he did not take any physical action against the defendant. Shortly after, Mr. Rego left, and the plaintiff then called the police.
25  The defendant's testimony was that, after dinner, his son and Jesse came into the house and said that a man had threatened to kick their heads in. He testified that he then went out of the house and into the yard, intending to identify the person. He saw a large man, Mr. Rycroft, and approached him, saying "excuse me are there problems with the kids?" He said the plaintiff replied "yeah you need to keep your fucking kids off my property." The defendant said that he responded by trying to explain that he had lived there for 14 years and pointed to his home. He said Mr. Rycroft replied "I know where you live. I need to go. You keep your kids off my property, you fucking Hindu."
26  The defendant said the plaintiff then pushed him, putting his hand on the defendant's left shoulder. His evidence was that, at that point, he was not angry but concerned. He said he first took a step back, and then he jumped up and put the plaintiff in a headlock. He claims that the plaintiff then started to throw a punch, and so he did as well. The defendant said the plaintiff subsequently "body-slammed" him into the ground, but that he continued to hold the plaintiff in a headlock.
27  The defendant testified that his wife then arrived, yelling at the men to stop. Mr. Rego testified that they both stood up and that the plaintiff said "you fucking Hindu" to him again. The defendant also described that, at that point, the plaintiff reached into his pocket, scaring Mr. Rego, who thought Mr. Rycroft had a weapon. The defendant said that he then grabbed his wife's hand and they left.
28  In essence, the defendant claims that, given that the plaintiff was a big man, after Mr. Rycroft pushed him, he became scared and that he lost his temper, having no choice but to fight back.
29  A number of witnesses testified regarding the altercation. In addition to the plaintiff and the defendant, those witnesses included the defendant's wife, as well as three persons who, at the time, were sitting on a nearby backyard deck having a barbecue and who watched the events.
30  Based on my examination of all of the evidence, my conclusions with respect to what occurred are as follows.
31  In order to investigate the reported damage caused to the bike park, shortly after returning home, the plaintiff entered the yard behind his residence. Immediately before the altercation, while Mr. Rycroft was walking at a moderate pace in the general direction of his own home, Mr. Rego, walking quite briskly, approached him.
32  I accept that the plaintiff said words to the effect of "you must be the dad; I do not want kids playing there anymore."
33  I find that, at that point, the defendant struck the side of the plaintiff's head. The version of events which most sensibly and logically explains the resulting bruise is that, when he was struck, Mr. Rycroft had his head turned to the right. The punch was of significant force and unexpected.
34  As a consequence of the blow, the plaintiff went down in a forward direction, ending up on his knees. He had his hands on the ground. The defendant immediately applied some type of headlock to Mr. Rycroft from behind.
35  The two men struggled, with Mr. Rego behind and above Mr. Rycroft. No significant blows were landed.
36  The physical engagement ended fairly quickly. The defendant let go of the plaintiff and moved away, and the plaintiff got to his feet.
37  The defendant said something to the effect of "do you want round two?" or "do you want some more?" The plaintiff responded in the affirmative, I expect probably more reflexively than seriously, but did nothing physically to further engage with the defendant. Instead, the plaintiff reached into his pocket, took out his phone, and called 911.
38  At that point, the defendant and his wife left and went home.
39  In the course of the altercation, the plaintiff sustained an injury to his left temple area, an injury which is depicted in the photo marked Exhibit 6. I find that bruise was caused by a blow from the defendant.
40  It is also reasonable to conclude that Mr. Rycroft sustained minor injuries to his arm, his elbow area, and his hand, likely from going to the ground.
41  Finally, I accept that the plaintiff incurred some injury to his knees, also resulting from going to the ground.
42  The plaintiff's description of the events includes the claim that he was punched multiple times and that he was struck twice on the back of his leg. I am unable to find that the defendant administered those blows.
43  In so finding, I do not mean to suggest that I believe the plaintiff is deliberately being untruthful when he described those blows. The fact is that, certainly from the perspective of the plaintiff, the events of the altercation occurred quite suddenly. There was a flurry of physical activity in the course of which he was struck and driven to the ground. In those circumstances, it is not reasonable to expect that he would have a clear, precise, step-by-step, recollection of everything that occurred.
44  The conclusions I have reached obviously do not accord with the testimony of the defendant and his wife. Specifically, I reject Mr. Rego's contention that he approached the plaintiff in a benign and inoffensive manner, that the incident began when the plaintiff stuck or pushed him, and that, in the course of the altercation, the plaintiff "body-slammed" him to the ground.
45  Some explanation for my findings is warranted.
46  A significant influence on my findings is the evidence provided by the three non-involved witnesses. As described above, these witnesses were situated on their back deck, an elevated location which provided a reasonably good vantage point from which to observe the events in question.
47  In examining the evidence of each of those three persons, I recognize that their descriptions of the events were not exactly the same. However, while there are some differences in terms of details, overall, their descriptions of the events are substantially and essentially similar. That, it seems to me, is what one might sensibly expect when persons are called upon to describe, fully and carefully, the details of a fairly brief encounter which they witnessed some seven years prior.
48  I am also cognizant of the fact that each of these witnesses knew the plaintiff previously. They had some type of acquaintanceship with him, whereas none of them had any such prior connection to the defendant.
49  Nevertheless, I observed each of these persons testify, in chief and under cross-examination, and I have scrutinized with care both the presentation and the content of their testimony. I find no reason to believe that any of them was tailoring his or her evidence to favour the plaintiff. I find no basis to disregard or substantially discount the evidence that these witnesses gave, other than to be cautious about it, given the passage of time and the fact that the ability of honest witnesses to observe, recall, and recount events cannot be held to a standard of perfection.
50  The evidence of these witnesses has informed my conclusion as to what occurred that day.
51  My assessment of the veracity and reliability of the plaintiff's description of the events is that he was generally trying to describe what happened in an accurate way. Certainly, I accept his evidence that he did not initiate any physical contact with the defendant.
52  I am not prepared to find that he has provided a description of the details of what occurred that is absolutely complete and accurate. However, I am inclined to attribute that to the fact that he was the target of an unexpected physical attack and, as well, that there is a certain element of indignation and embarrassment that flows from that, rather than any deliberate untruthfulness.
53  As I will explain later in these reasons, I have misgivings with respect to the extent of the damages that the plaintiff claims to have suffered as a consequence of the assault. However, I am confident that the findings I have made about the specifics of the event are solidly and reliably grounded in a fair assessment of the evidence.
54  As for the testimony of the defendant and his wife, I am unable to accept it in certain material particulars.
55  Firstly, both the defendant and Mrs. Rego say that, after being told the children had been threatened, the defendant went out of his house, through his yard, and onto the property, not angry or upset but, rather, calm and concerned.
56  I am unable to accept that as being true. The fact is, this was the second time that day that the boys had said (probably with a reasonable measure of truth) that they had been given a hard time by a man while they were outside and playing in an area where they (and the Regos) believed they had a right to be.
57  In these circumstances, I have no reservations in concluding that when Mr. Rego went outside to deal with this problem, he was angry. I believe he went out there to confront the problem directly.
58  The evidence of the three eyewitnesses is that the defendant was moving toward the plaintiff quickly and purposefully. One described him as "walking fast"; another described it as "high-stepping." These witnesses also reported that Ms. Rego was not far behind the defendant, seemingly urging him to stop, and that, despite this, he "sucker punched" the plaintiff.
59  Clearly, this testimony is starkly at odds with the defendant's claim that he approached the plaintiff in a restrained way, saying words to the effect of "excuse me, are there problems with the kids?" and that he only resorted to physical force after the plaintiff struck him and directed a racial slur at him. The defendant's description of these events is not only pronouncedly at variance with the other evidence to which I have referred, but it is also at odds with what, given the circumstances of the encounter, common sense would dictate.
60  With respect to the credibility of the defendant, I note that, in cross-examination, he was referred to two statements that he had made in his examination for discovery, statements which he acknowledged to be true, and which were inconsistent with his trial testimony. One of these statements concerned whether he had been injured in the altercation. At trial, he said he had been injured, although not badly. On examination for discovery, he said, in response to the same question "No, I was not."
61  The other statement concerns the defendant's claims regarding what the plaintiff did immediately after the physical altercation ended. At trial, the defendant said that, after the men were back on their feet, he saw the plaintiff reach into his pocket and testified that he thought the plaintiff was drawing a weapon, but that he did not see one. On his examination for discovery, when asked what he thought the plaintiff was actually doing when he reached into his pocket, the defendant replied "drawing a... I have no idea. Actually, I have no idea what he was doing."
62  The testimony of Ms. Rego is also problematic. She says that she did not accompany the defendant as he went out into the field. Instead, she says that she did not get to the men until they were already on the ground, and that she then yelled at them to stop, which they did.
63  This description of events is quite different than the evidence of two of the balcony witnesses. They described her following the defendant as he approached the plaintiff and, according to one of them, urging him to back off or stop. I note as well that the plaintiff testified that he observed both the defendant and the defendant's wife walking toward him.
64  Ms. Rego's evidence is also curious in that she says she told the men to stop, which they did, but then she says that she did not see them stand up. It seems logical to me, given her description of the concern she had about the rather distressing sight of these men struggling on the ground, and the fact that she told them to stop, that she would have seen how matters ended.
65  I accept that witnesses often see matters through their own lens and that their evidence can reasonably be understood to reflect that perspective. However, in this case, I am unable to accept that, in their testimony, the defendant and Ms. Rego accurately described the altercation.
66  I find that Mr. Rego quickly approached Mr. Rycroft and, despite his wife's admonitions, struck the plaintiff, who had done nothing to physically engage with the defendant.
67  There is another aspect of the evidence that merits mention. Both Mr. and Ms. Rego testified that, both before and after the physical altercation, Mr. Rycroft referred to Mr. Rego as a "fucking Hindu." None of the other eyewitnesses, who also appeared to have some reasonable ability to hear what occurred in the course of the incident, had any recollection of that having been said. When asked, Mr. Rycroft denied that he had said any such thing to Mr. Rego.
68  To my mind, that seems to be an odd remark to have been made. Having observed Mr. Rego in the courtroom, I noted nothing about him that would suggest that he has the appearance traditionally associated with people from the Indian subcontinent. I am, of course, assuming that when the defendant said that Mr, Rycroft made this remark, that was the basis of it.
69  I make no finding as to whether such a comment was made. In any event, even if Mr. Rycroft had said such a thing to Mr. Rego, it would not be determinative as to the legal consequences of what occurred.
70  Furthermore, it is, in my view, somewhat telling that it was Mr. Rycroft who called the police, not Mr. Rego. Evidently, it was the plaintiff's view that he had been assaulted and that he was the victim. On the other hand, although Mr. Rego's description of the event would amply support him feeling that he had been quite improperly set upon, physically assaulted, and verbally abused by the plaintiff, a man he had good cause to believe had threatened his son, he testified that he did not take any steps to notify the authorities. While that may have been a not entirely unreasonable choice for him to make, I find it at least somewhat curious that he thought that there would be no reason to notify the authorities or to complain to them that he had been the victim of an assault.
71  I should note that this last observation is not one of the fundamental bases upon which I make my findings. I do not think that the defendant's lack of action is, by any means, determinative of the issue. Instead, it is one of a number of tertiary evidentiary facets which informed my assessment.
72  One final observation I will make is with respect to the size and appearance of the two men. On the one hand, it is true that the plaintiff is a fairly large man. Intending him no disrespect, certainly as he appeared at trial, he seemed quite out-of-shape and lumbering. As well, the evidence is that he was, at the time, not in good health, having recently experienced problems with his heart. In short, while of large size, the plaintiff did not appear to be a man who would be in fighting shape. Mr. Rego is a smaller man, but appears lean, fit and trim. From his testimony, I conclude that he has been involved in coaching youth soccer. Presumably, he is at least somewhat physically active.
73  In terms of apparent capability to handle themselves physically, while my assessment is based on little other than what I have noted, my impression is that it would be wrong to see this as a match where a large and physically able man was bullying a small and vulnerable person.
74  Again, that observation is not the basis for the conclusions I have reached, but offered only to make clear that I have considered that aspect of the matter.
75  In the final analysis, I am satisfied that, on a fair assessment of the totality of the evidence, the conclusions that I have reached with respect to the altercation between these men are reasonable and properly supported by the evidence.
76  Given those findings, I am obliged to consider the defences put forward by Mr. Rego.
77  Shortly put, following from the rather lengthy discussion set out above, I do not believe there is a plausible argument to be made that the plaintiff consented to the altercation. In addition, I reject the submission that the defendant was acting in defence of himself or anyone else.
78  As for provocation, that is not a complete defence. Rather, it is a factor that, if found to be present, can be considered in mitigation of damages. In order for the defendant to be able to invoke the principle of provocation, the court must find that the conduct of the plaintiff caused the defendant to have lost his power of self-control, and that such conduct must have taken place in the immediate context of the assault. It is a recognition that the actions of a plaintiff can sometimes cause a defendant, in the heat of the moment, to take leave of his sense of judgment and act out violently. On this point, this Court recently cited with approval the following passage from Lewis N. Klar, Q.C., Tort Law, 5th ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2012) in Robinson v. Bud's Bar Inc.,  at para 134:
PROVOCATION
Provocation has been defined as "conduct which caused the defendant to lose his power of self-control, and which occurred at the time of, or shortly before, the tortious act of the defendant." It generally involves insulting or taunting words, or conduct which, although falling short of assault necessitating a defensive reaction, incite the defendant. Because the plaintiff's conduct does not require that the defendant take protective action, but merely provokes an often violent reaction, provocation is not regarded as a complete defence to an intentional tort, nor justification for tortious behaviour. Provocation operates as a type of contributory negligence, mitigating, though not eliminating, the plaintiff's damages.
79  Frankly, it is my view that Mr. Rego was, unfortunately, angry when he approached Mr. Rycroft and decided, rashly, to deal with the person he thought had been acting offensively toward his son and his son's friend. Nothing the plaintiff did immediately before the altercation began can be said to have constituted a provocation of Mr. Rego. As noted above, I find that the defendant was angry when he approached Mr. Rycroft, and that that anger overwhelmed his better judgment, resulting in the assault. What he did was ill-considered and foolish - a brief but quite regrettable event that has had significant regrettable repercussions for all concerned.
80  It follows that I am unable to conclude that the defendant's actions resulted from any provocation on Mr. Rycroft's part.
81  Therefore, in light of all the matters discussed in this section of my reasons, I find that the tort of battery has been made out.
The Claim for Damages
82  The plaintiff claims damages under a number of different heads:
Nonpecuniary damages;
Past income loss;
Loss of earning capacity;
Aggravated damages; and
Punitive damages.
83  In addition, there are two claims advanced on the basis of the following statutes:
Crime Victim Assistance Act, S.B.C. 2001, c. 38; and
Health Care Cost Recovery Act, S.B.C. 2008, c. 27.
Nonpecuniary Damages
84  An assessment of the plaintiff's claim for nonpecuniary damages must begin with this Court's findings regarding the injuries visited upon him by the defendant.
85  The plaintiff is 53 years of age. He is divorced and was, at the time of the incident, living alone in his rented home. He was employed as a long-haul truck driver. As a result of the assault, he claims to have sustained injuries to the following parts of his body:
Both knees;
Right elbow, arm, and hand;
Left eye; and
Jaw.
86  In addition, he says that the events in question have had a serious psychological effect on him. Specifically, he claims that it has changed his personality, making him more withdrawn and depressed.
87  In regards to the plaintiff's claimed physical injuries, the matter of his purported knee injury is by no means straightforward. Supported by the medical opinion of Dr. Shiraz Mawani, who has been his family physician for many years, the plaintiff says that the worst injury he sustained in the event was a contusion to his right knee and a tear in the posterior horn of his right knee's medial meniscus. Mr. Rycroft claims that, as a result of injuries he sustained during the altercation, the knee subsequently required surgical debridement.
88  An x-ray taken of the knee in August 2009, a month after the assault, showed only "minor narrowing of the medial tibiofemoral compartment with minor osteophystosis of the femoral and tibia condyles, in keeping with mild-to-moderate osteoarthritic degenerative changes." However, the plaintiff says that, up to that point, his right knee had been entirely asymptomatic and fully functional. In addition, Mr. Rycroft submits that, despite the suggestion arising from the x-ray that there were only minor changes, the fact is that, as a consequence of the assault, he had severe pain and limitation in his right knee.
89  An MRI was taken of the knee in May 2010. This MRI disclosed a torn medial meniscus and more significant degenerative osteoarthritic changes.
90  The theory of the plaintiff is that the initial mild osteoarthritic changes in the right knee progressed to more severe changes. Ultimately, in March 2011, Dr. Trevor Stone (an orthopedic surgeon) performed an arthroscopy on the right knee.
91  In summary, it is the position of the plaintiff that the injury initially appeared to be minor, but eventually manifested as a significant problem that required surgical intervention and that will likely require further medical intervention, a total knee replacement.
92  In regards to his left knee, in 2006, the plaintiff was involved in a workplace accident that caused a lateral meniscal tear in that knee. That required arthroscopic debridement. An MRI and other investigations taken at the time disclosed a significant osteoarthritic change in both the left knee's medial and patella-femoral compartments.
93  The plaintiff accepts that all of those changes and conditions were not caused by the assault, as they were present before it.
94  Nevertheless, it is the position of the plaintiff that, as a result of the injury to his right knee during the assault, he was forced to place an additional load on his left knee. Consequently, this additional burden led to more wear and tear of his left knee, thereby hastening more severe arthritic changes. The plaintiff says that, while his left knee had been symptomatic prior to the assault, he had nevertheless been mobile and active, able to carry on his ordinary day-to-day activities.
95  It is important to note that Mr. Rycroft had a left knee replacement in October 2015. He was approximately three months in recovery, and testified that the left knee remains symptomatic in that it continues to experience some discomfort and continues to limit his activities.
96  Dr. Stone opines that the osteoarthritis in Mr. Rycroft's right knee is likely to progress and that it is likely that the plaintiff will ultimately require a total right knee replacement.
97  Consequently, the plaintiff says that both his knees are now injured, significantly impacting upon his enjoyment of life, his ability to partake of his usual activities, and to earn an income.
98  In terms of other physical injuries, Mr. Rycroft claims to have sustained a contusion to his right elbow. While that was initially symptomatic and painful, it has essentially resolved.
99  Mr. Rycroft also says that, following the assault, the vision in his left eye deteriorated as a result of the formation of a cataract.
100  Mr. Rycroft was referred to a specialist in ophthalmology, Dr. Gabriel Chu, who performed a left cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. Mr. Rycroft's vision in that eye is essentially restored.
101  Dr. Chu testified at trial. He described having performed the cataract surgery on Mr. Rycroft's left eye on January 29, 2013. He examined Mr. Rycroft and found no cataracts in his right eye.
102  The theory of the plaintiff is that the cataract injury was likely the result of the trauma that Mr. Rycroft sustained in the assault. In their opinions, both Drs. Chu and Mawani make reference to the injury being the "likely result of the trauma that Mr. Rycroft sustained in the assault, wherein he was punched repeatedly on the left side of the left eye."
103  Mr. Rycroft also complained of injury to his jaw. He testified that there was discomfort immediately following the altercation, and attributes that soreness to having been choked by Mr. Rego. He reports that the jaw pain went away within a few weeks of the incident in question.
104  In short, the position of the plaintiff is that the injuries which he sustained in the altercation with the defendant have substantially impacted upon a number of aspects of his life, including his everyday enjoyment of life and his ability to function in his employment.
105  I will further discuss the issue of the impact of the injuries upon his working circumstances later in these reasons. For now, I will more directly address his claim that the injuries have had a very significant effect upon him in terms of pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life.
106  The defendant submits that there is a substantial body of evidence which should cause of this Court to have grave misgivings about Mr. Rycroft's claims concerning the extent and effect of his injuries.
107  In the course of a rigorous cross-examination, a number of propositions were put to Mr. Rycroft, particularly with respect to instances of prior injury and claims that he made respecting those.
108  His prior work history was also examined in careful detail.
109  As noted, the evidence establishes that, in 2006, Mr. Rycroft sustained an injury to his left knee in a workplace accident. As a consequence, he took time off and had medical treatment.
110  In cross-examination, it was put to the plaintiff that on July 6, 2009, four days before the incident in question, he had contacted a representative of WorkSafe BC to make inquiries about an injury to his left knee. The record to which counsel made reference in the course of cross-examination indicated as follows:
Worker advised two days after he returned to his job he was laid off work. He is having ongoing problems with his left knee, going down the stairs and he is limping on it.
He is having a hard time finding work as he is a truck driver and is inquiring if retraining is possible.
He will be following up with his doctor to have a report sent in.
111  When queried at trial about this contact, Mr. Rycroft downplayed its significance. He testified that he did not recall saying that it was an ongoing problem or that he had reported that he was limping.
112  It is to be noted that, following the event at bar, the plaintiff continued to work at his job for a further 2 1/2 weeks, at which time he stopped.
113  Also of significance, it seems to me, are the steps that the plaintiff took following the altercation to seek medical attention for the injuries that he says he sustained.
114  The attendances and notations, as reflected in the clinical notes, are contained in Dr. Mawani's report. They read as follows:
23 July 2009:
Patient presented again for soreness of the left knee. He indicated that it had continued ever since the arthroscopy in September 2006. He was limping on it. Then he cracked and occasionally felt unstable. It swelled. He was unable to walk any distance or ride a bike. He was frustrated and wanted it fixed. Apparently he had been off work for one and 1-1/2 years prior and had started driving a truck 3 weeks previously.
12 August 2009:
Patient was seen for the first time following an ASSAULT which had taken place on July 7, 2009. Apparently a male person a jumped on his back, had his neck in an elbow lock and he was choking. His left knee, which was usually sore, had given out and he fell onto his right knee and right elbow onto hard dirt. The knee had swollen up and had been sore since. He had also been punched on his left temple, quite out of the blue.
The knee pain was mainly in front of the knee around the patella, spreading down the front of the right leg to above the ankle and, as wel,l [sic] behind the knee in the popliteal fossa.
Examination showed no effusion or bruising. Patient was extremely sensitive to flexion and extension of the knee and very tender in the patellar tendon and lateral tibial condyle. He was tender along the lateral aspect of the right leg along the tibia. Hyperextension was very painful.
115  There are a number of entries which follow. They disclose that the plaintiff saw Dr. Mawani an additional four times in 2009. The principal notation in those visits is with respect to complaints of right knee pain.
116  Having examined the documented medical history and the trial evidence regarding it, taken in conjunction with the plaintiff's work records and in the context of his trial testimony, I find myself unable to glean a clear picture of his circumstances.
117  The conclusion that I take is that, prior to the events of July 10, 2009, his work history had been somewhat sporadic and uneven. At the time of the altercation, he had been working at his job as a driver with LA Transport for only a matter of two or three weeks. As best I can discern, prior to that, he had not worked between September 2008 and June 2009.
118  I also conclude that, as detailed above, he had been in contact with WorkSafe BC to report problems with his left knee just days prior to the altercation.
119  The timing and manner in which the plaintiff sought medical attention as a consequence of the altercation is, in my view, somewhat curious in light of his claim of having sustained acute physical injuries.
120  In the result, I have a degree of reservation about whether the substantial physical injuries and their effect which Mr. Rycroft ascribes to the altercation meet the standard of proof that must be attained.
121  I believe that Mr. Rycroft's prior left knee condition was symptomatic at the time of the event, and was of sufficient seriousness to constitute meaningful interference with his ability to work. I also find that that condition was a substantial factor affecting his long-term vocational fitness.
122  There is no doubt that he sustained some physical injury in the altercation, but it was not of the degree of seriousness that he urges this Court to find.
123  The defendant is responsible for the harm and injury that his unlawful act caused. However, in determining the damages he must pay, the Court is required to make proper allowance for those conditions that were pre-existing and were not caused by the conduct of the defendant. On this point, the Supreme Court of Canada stated the following in Athey v. Leonati,  at para. 32:
32 ... The essential purpose and most basic principle of tort law is that the plaintiff must be placed in the position he or she would have been in absent the defendant's negligence (the "original position"). However, the plaintiff is not to be placed in a position better than his or her original one. It is therefore necessary not only to determine the plaintiff's position after the tort but also to assess what the "original position" would have been. It is the difference between these positions, the "original position" and the "injured position", which is the plaintiff's loss...
[Emphasis in original]
124  The challenge in this case is to fairly and properly determine the damages for which the defendant is responsible.
125  This task is made more difficult by the fact that the plaintiff's pre-incident history is neither clear nor straightforward. As well, as noted above, it is questionable whether he is able to provide accurate and reliable testimony.
126  That is not to say that I am concluding that the plaintiff has been deliberately untruthful in his testimony. However, the fact remains that some of the details of his employment and medical circumstances are unclear and somewhat confusing. He has shown himself to be an unreliable historian. In addition, as witnessed by the plaintiff's employment history, there seems to be a tendency on his part to seek benefits on the basis that he is unable to maintain employment.
127  Given the onus that rests upon the plaintiff to prove his claim, these deficiencies must necessarily impact this Court's assessment.
128  I find that the defendant's assault upon Mr. Rycroft injured the left side of his head, causing a laceration and bruising. Moreover, Mr. Rycroft sustained some soft tissue injuries to his arm, elbow and hand, but I find those to be of a relatively modest severity. As a result, I find that no ongoing effect has been proven.
129  The assault also injured the plaintiff's left eye which subsequently required cataract surgery. This matter has caused me some concern. There was a substantial passage of time between the incident and the operation that Dr. Chu performed. As well, in attributing the cause of the condition to the assault, both Dr. Chu and Mawani make reference to "repeated punches to the left side of the left eye." As my findings indicate, I am not satisfied that there were multiple punches, although there was certainly one. However, upon reflection, I accept that the plaintiff has proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the injury to his eye resulted from the defendant's blow. That said, I also find that that injury has substantially resolved.
130  In regards to the plaintiff's knees, I find that the event resulted in some meaningful injury to the plaintiff's right knee. I am satisfied that there was pre-existing degenerative change present in the right knee, but that it was not symptomatic prior to the altercation. I find that the injury he sustained to the right knee during the altercation resulted in the onset of significant pain that has required medical intervention, including an arthroscopic medial meniscectomy. That procedure has not, and will not, provide full relief from the pain, stiffness and decrease of function that attends the condition. Mr. Rycroft will require a total replacement of his right knee and, in fact, at the time of trial, that replacement was scheduled to be done fairly imminently. Those consequences are attributable to the battery.
131  As for the left knee injury, I find that that was a pre-existing and symptomatic condition. Consequently, the defendant does not bear responsibility for it.
132  With respect to the contention of the plaintiff that the injury to his right knee has resulted in aggravation to his left knee, and that it has caused unusual wear and deterioration to his hip, I reject those claims as unproven. In this regard, I rely upon the evidence of Dr. Stone, whose opinion I consider to be the most authoritative on the matter.
133  I accept that the injuries he sustained caused him some pain, suffering, and diminishment of enjoyment of life, including feelings of despondency and a concern for being secure in his own home. Certainly, some of those effects continue to some degree and will be present going forward.
134  With respect to determining a monetary value of damages to compensate the plaintiff for those nonpecuniary losses, both the plaintiff and the defendant have provided submissions as to an appropriate quantum. These submissions have been supported by reference to other court decisions that each party says validates their respective positions.
135  The plaintiff acknowledges that, prior to the event in question, he had various health concerns, including a serious injury to his left knee resulting from the accident in 2006 for which he had undergone surgery. He concedes it was still symptomatic prior to the battery. He also acknowledges that he had suffered from a heart arrhythmia. At the time of the battery he was 57 years old and was active to some extent. He maintained his own home and assisted his mother at hers.
136  Mr. Rycroft says that he is been diligent in following the advice given to him by the medical professionals he has seen, and has taken the medications prescribed to him. He attended at physiotherapy. He underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair the medial meniscus of his right knee and underwent a total left knee replacement. He intends to have a total right knee replacement.
137  Mr. Rycroft says that, despite his best efforts, his quality of life has been markedly diminished.
138  In the plaintiff's submission, an appropriate award for nonpecuniary damages in this case is in the order of <damage type = "other">$100,000</damage>. He relies on the following cases; a common theme in them is knee injury:
Tchir v. South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority, ;
Majchrzak v. Avery, ;
Thomasson v. Moeller, ;
Zhang v. Graham, ;
Reddy v. Staples, ;
Kathuria v. Wildgrove, ; and
Graham v. Lee, .
139  The defendant says that the plaintiff's injuries are modest and submits that an appropriate award is in the range of <damage type = "other">$8,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$10,000</damage>. In short, he says that there is insufficient evidence to establish that any morphological changes to Mr. Rycroft's right knee were caused by the incident. He says that, at most, the incident caused an exacerbation of knee pain that would have occurred in the absence of the incident. In addition, he says that the left knee was symptomatic prior to the incident and the elbow pain was not reported until some two months after the incident. Similarly, the defendant takes the position that the plaintiff has not satisfactorily established that the altercation caused any harm to his vision.
140  In the defendant's submission, the following cases are supportive of his position:
Ross v. Dhillon, ;
Gatzke v. Sidhu, ;
Chrisgian v. Hatzisavva, ;
Manering v. Imanian et al, ; and
Khodadoost v. Wittkamper, .
141  In my view, there were real injuries sustained by Mr. Rycroft. However, for the reasons I have set out, the extent of what he has proven does not warrant damages in the order of the quantum he seeks. In determining what I consider to be an appropriate award of damages, I have taken into account the disruption that these events have caused in his life, and that there will be further discomfort, particularly because of the pain and attendant disruption that will result from the knee replacement that will be required. I conclude that an appropriate award is <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$70,000</damage>.
Past Income Loss
142  A plaintiff is entitled to recover damages to compensate him for past income loss resulting from the defendant's wrongful conduct. As explained by the BC Court of Appeal in Rowe v. Bobell Express Ltd.,  at paras. 30-31:
[30] Thus, in my view, a claim for what is often described as "past loss of income" is actually a claim for loss of earning capacity; that is, a claim for the loss of the value of the work that the injured plaintiff would have performed but was unable to perform because of the injury.
[31] Evidence of this value may take many forms. As was said by Kenneth D. Cooper-Stephenson in Personal Injury Damages in Canada, 2nd ed. (Scarborough, Ont.: Carswell, 1996) at 205-06,
... The essence of the task under this head of damages is to award compensation for any pecuniary loss which will result from an inability to work. "Loss of the value of work" is the substance of the claim -- loss of the value of any work the plaintiff would have done but for the accident but now will be unable to do. The loss framed in this way may be measured in different ways. Sometimes it will be measured by reference to the actual earnings the plaintiff would have received; sometimes by a replacement cost evaluation of tasks which the plaintiff will now be unable to perform; sometimes by an assessment of reduced company profits; and sometimes by the amount of secondary income lost, such as shared family income.
[My underscoring; other emphasis in original]
143  In this case, Mr. Rycroft's historical employment was principally as a truck driver and an equipment operator. In 2006, he sustained an injury to his left knee which interfered with his ability to work. In 2007, he experienced a heart arrhythmia which prevented him from working until 2008. In fact, he had returned to work only three weeks prior to the incident at bar.
144  Following the assault, Mr. Rycroft worked for a further two or three weeks and then was out of work until late in the year.
145  Over the subsequent years, up to trial, he worked sporadically. There were some years that he had no income at all.
146  Mr. Rycroft submits that an appropriate means of quantifying the damages he has sustained under this head is to go forward on the premise that he would be capable of earning <damage type = "other">$45,000</damage> each year. He proposes that the Court would then subtract from that amount what his actual earnings were for the respective years in issue. The calculation that he advances is as follows:
147  In the result, the plaintiff seeks an award of <damage type = "other">$195,545</damage> for income loss to the date of trial.
148  In my respectful view, that approach to the analysis is not warranted in the circumstances. I consider it necessary in making this assessment to take into account the problems that he was having with his left knee, including that, at the time of the incident, he was actively pursuing compensation and suggesting that he was unable to continue working. There were also other medical issues, namely his cardiac condition, plus the fact that his employment history is sporadic and uneven.
149  In the final analysis, it is my view that an appropriate award of damages to compensate the plaintiff for his loss of income prior to trial, due to the conduct of the defendant, is substantially less. I find an appropriate award to be <damage type = "past wage loss">$100,000</damage>.
Loss of Earning Capacity
150  The general principles that apply when determining a plaintiff's loss of earning capacity were outlined succinctly by the BC Court of Appeal in Villing v. Husseni,  at paras. 17-20:
Legal Principles Governing an Award for Loss of Earning Capacity
[17] In order to receive an award for loss of earning capacity, a plaintiff must prove a real and substantial possibility that his or her earning capacity has been impaired: Perren v. Lalari,  at paras. 30-32 [Perren]. If the plaintiff has discharged the burden of proof, then the judge must turn to an assessment of damages. The assessment may be based on an earnings approach or a capital asset approach: Perren at para. 32. An earnings approach is most appropriate where the loss is more easily quantifiable. In general, a party may be forced to default to a capital asset approach where the loss is not easily quantifiable.
[18] Using the capital asset approach does not mean the assessment is unstructured. Garson J.A.'s observations in Morgan v. Galbraith,  are apposite:
[56] If the assessment is still to be based on the capital asset approach the judge must consider the four questions in Brown in the context of the facts of this case and make findings of fact as to the nature and extent of the plaintiff's loss of capacity and how that loss may impact the plaintiff's ability to earn income. Adopting the capital asset approach does not mean that the assessment is entirely at large without the necessity to explain the factual basis of the award: Morris v. Rose Estate (1996),  (BC CA),  at para. 24, ; Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate (1995),  (BC CA),  at para. 43, .
[Emphasis added.]
[19] In every case where the capital asset approach is adopted, the four questions in Brown v. Golaiy (1985),  (BC SC),  at para. 8 (S.C.), form the basis of the assessment. The questions are whether:
The plaintiff has been rendered less capable overall from earning income from all types of employment;
The plaintiff is less marketable or attractive as an employee to potential employers;
The plaintiff has lost the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities which might otherwise have been open to him, had he not been injured; and
The plaintiff is less valuable to himself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour market.
[20] The considerations in Brown are not intended to be exhaustive: Sinnott v. Boggs,  at para. 9, per Mackenzie J.A.
151  As of the date of trial, Mr. Rycroft is 63 years of age. He testified that he would like to continue to work as a long-haul trucker up until the age of 70. He says that he is aware of others in the industry who have done so.
152  On that basis, his submission is that the Court should calculate the value of his loss as being the present value of five years of future income at <damage type = "other">$45,000</damage> per year, for a total of <damage type = "other">$215,217</damage>. Alternatively, he submits that, if the Court was to use a capital asset approach, then an award of two years income at <damage type = "other">$45,000</damage> per year or <damage type = "other">$90,000</damage> would appropriate.
153  Again, with respect, I am unable to accept those submissions as reasonable. Given Mr. Rycroft's employment history, and taking into account the other relevant considerations relating to his health that were unrelated to the conduct of the defendant, I am quite sceptical that Mr. Rycroft would have continued to work regularly at that job until his late 60s.
154  Using the capital asset approach, it is my conclusion that the appropriate award under this head is <damage type = "future wage loss">$45,000</damage>.
Aggravated and Punitive Damages
155  The plaintiff seeks additional awards under the heads of aggravated and punitive damages. The Supreme Court of Canada distinguished these two types of damages in Vorvis v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia,  at para. 16:
[16] Before dealing with the question of punitive damages, it will be well to make clear the distinction between punitive and aggravated damages, for in the argument before us and in some of the materials filed there appeared some confusion as to the distinction. Punitive damages, as the name would indicate, are designed to punish. In this, they constitute an exception to the general common law rule that damages are designed to compensate the injured, not to punish the wrongdoer. Aggravated damages will frequently cover conduct which could also be the subject of punitive damages, but the role of aggravated damages remains compensatory. The distinction is clearly set out in Waddams, The Law of Damages (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 562, para. 979, in these words:
An exception exists to the general rule that damages are compensatory. This is the case of an award made for the purpose, not of compensating the plaintiff, but of punishing the defendant. Such awards have been called exemplary, vindictive, penal, punitive, aggravated and retributory, but the expressions in common modern use to describe damages going beyond compensatory are exemplary and punitive damages. "Exemplary" was preferred by the House of Lords in Cassell & Co. Ltd. v. Broome, but "punitive" has also been used in many Canadian courts including the Supreme Court of Canada in H.L. Weiss Forwarding Ltd. v. Omnus. The expression "aggravated damages", though it has sometimes been used interchangeably with punitive or exemplary damages, has more frequently in recent times been contrasted with exemplary damages. In this contrasting sense, aggravated damages describes an award that aims at compensation, but takes full account of the intangible injuries, such as distress and humiliation, that may have been caused by the defendant's insulting behaviour. The expressions vindictive, penal and retributory have dropped out of common use.
Aggravated damages are awarded to compensate for aggravated damage. As explained by Waddams, they take account of intangible injuries and by definition will generally augment damages assessed under the general rules relating to the assessment of damages. Aggravated damages are compensatory in nature and may only be awarded for that purpose. Punitive damages, on the other hand, are punitive in nature and may only be employed in circumstances where the conduct giving the cause for complaint is of such nature that it merits punishment.
156  When assessing these types of damages, the BC Court of Appeal has made it clear that courts should consider aggravated damages before considering punitive damages: Huff v. Price,  (BCCA). Consequently, I have followed that structure in my decision.
157  On the matter of aggravated damages, it is my view that the issue of intangible injuries was substantially addressed in the award of nonpecuniary damages. While the plaintiff seeks an award under this head in the amount of <damage type = "other">$10,000</damage>, it is my conclusion that an appropriate sum is <damage type = "aggravated">$2,500</damage>.
158  In regard to punitive damages, Mr. Rycroft seeks an award under this head of damages in the amount of <damage type = "other">$15,000</damage>.
159  Before outlining my findings on this head of damages, it is important to further set out the law concerning punitive damages. Courts have made it clear that these damages apply when the defendant's conduct was especially malicious, and that such damages are not meant to be compensatory. On this point, the Supreme Court of Canada said the following in Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto,  at para 196:
Punitive damages may be awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Punitive damages bear no relation to what the plaintiff should receive by way of compensation. Their aim is not to compensate the plaintiff, but rather to punish the defendant. It is the means by which the jury or judge expresses its outrage at the egregious conduct of the defendant. They are in the nature of a fine which is meant to act as a deterrent to the defendant and to others from acting in this manner. It is important to emphasize that punitive damages should only be awarded in those circumstances where the combined award of general and aggravated damages would be insufficient to achieve the goal of punishment and deterrence.
160  In Bowen Contracting Ltd. v. B.C. Log Spill Recovery Co-operative Association,  at para. 23, the BC Court of Appeal summarized the following ten principles which the Supreme Court of Canada found, in Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co., , to apply when considering punitive damages:
Punitive damages are not limited to particular "categories" of wrongs, although by their nature they will "largely be restricted to intentional torts";
The general objectives of punitive damages are punishment, deterrence of the wrongdoer and others, and denunciation;
Since the primary vehicle of punishment is criminal law, punitive damages should be resorted to only in "exceptional cases and with restraint";
The use of pejoratives such as "high-handed" or "oppressive" does not provide useful guidance (or discipline) to judges or juries and a more principled approach is desirable. (Notwithstanding this, the Court said at para. 94 that punitive damages are to be imposed only if there has been "high-handed, malicious, arbitrary or highly reprehensible misconduct that departs to a marked degree from ordinary standards of decent behaviour.");
In setting punitive damages, the court should ask itself "in particular" how an award would further one or other of the objectives of the law and what is the lowest award that would serve the purpose;
It is "rational" to use punitive damages to relieve a wrongdoer of its profits where compensatory damages would amount to "nothing more than a licence fee to earn greater profits through outrageous disregard of the legal or equitable rights of others."
A "formulaic" approach should be avoided. The court should focus not on the plaintiff's loss but on the defendant's misconduct;
The overall award should be rationally related to the objectives for which punitive damages are awarded;
Juries should receive more help from judges concerning the function of punitive damages and factors governing such awards and the assessment of a proper amount;
Punitive damages are not "at large" and an appellate court may intervene if an award exceeds the outer boundaries of a rational and measured response to the facts of the case.
161  In addition, as outlined in Home Equity Development Inc. v. Crow,  at para. 179, the proper award of punitive damages must be proportionate to the following factors:
The blameworthiness of the defendant's conduct; including
whether the misconduct was planned and deliberate
the intent and motive of the defendant
The degree of vulnerability of the plaintiff.
The harm or potential harm specifically directed at the plaintiff.
The need for deterrence.
Taking into account the other penalties, both civil and criminal, which have been or which are likely to be inflicted on the defendant for the same misconduct.
The advantage wrongfully gained by the defendant from the misconduct.
162  In my respectful view, while the conduct of the defendant was undoubtedly wrong and warrants sanction, I must also take into account that what occurred was in the nature of a foolish loss of temper and acting out. On the basis of my findings, Mr. Rego was angry at what he considered to be harsh treatment of his son. He confronted the party he thought was responsible and did so in an unacceptable way.
163  At the same time, this was not a planned, deliberate and calculated attempt to physically assault another person.
164  While I accept that it would be well within the realm of reason to impose punitive damages, I also take into account the findings that I have made in this case, together with the very substantial awards of damages that I have outlined above. Consequently, I find that adding punitive damages to those awards would constitute adding to what is already a very significant sanction upon Mr. Rego in circumstances where I do not expect that he will be able to rely on any insurance policy to satisfy the damages award.
165  There is no question that this Court's findings of the defendant's responsibility and the damage awards made will impose a substantial financial hardship upon him and constitutes a serious censure of his conduct.
166  In my view, this is an appropriate case in which to decline to make any award under this head of damages.
Crime Victim Assistance Act and Health Care Costs Recovery Act
167  The plaintiff briefly noted that he had received a <damage type = "other">$36,833.42</damage> award through the operation of the Crime Victim Assistance Act. The Director of the Crime Victim Assistance Program has asserted a subrogated claim for this amount.
168  In addition, Mr. Rycroft notes that the Minister of Health, moving under the Health Care Costs Recovery Act, has provided a Minister's Certificate dated June 6, 2016 claiming the return of <damage type = "other">$5,783.45</damage> in healthcare costs provided to him. The plaintiff claims that these costs were incurred as a result of the injuries he sustained during the altercation.
169  Neither of the parties provided substantive submissions on these two recovery claims. Similarly, in Mittenen v. Dudley,  [Mittenen], the Court said the following at paras. 84-85:
[84] During the submissions there was reference to claims for subrogated costs under the Health Care Recovery Act or for Victim Services. However, the submissions I received in that respect were incomplete.
[85] As requested I will allow liberty to make further submission on the question of subrogated claims, provided that an application to deal with that is initiated within 30 days. That is by request to the trial scheduling manager to make further submissions. Submissions may be submitted in writing on a schedule that I will set if a request is made for further submissions. If counsel wish as well to have an oral hearing, they may so indicate in the written submission, or they may indicate that they are content to simply make written submissions.
170  Given the parties' lack of submissions on this point, I believe that the Court's approach taken by the court in Mittenen should also be adopted here.
171  If the parties wish to have me make a determination on these recovery claims, then they have 30 days from the date of the release of this decision to put in a request to trial scheduling to make further submissions. However, in these circumstances, I will only allow written submissions.
Conclusion
172  In summary, I have determined that the plaintiff has succeeded in making out his claim for battery. The defendant is liable to Mr. Rycroft for the injuries he suffered as a result of the altercation.
173  I have assessed Mr. Rycroft's award of damages as follows:
Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$70,000</damage>;
Past Income loss: <damage type = "past wage loss">$100,000</damage>;
Loss of earning capacity: <damage type = "future wage loss">$45,000</damage>;
Aggravated Damages: <damage type = "aggravated">$2,500</damage>; and
Punitive Damages: Nil
 Total: <damage type = "total">$217,500</damage> 
In addition, he is entitled to recover pre-judgement interest on the damages that were awarded for his past income loss.
174  Upon receipt of further written submissions by the parties, I will deal with the matter of any additional awards determinations regarding the Crime Victim Assistance Act and Health Care Costs Recovery Act claims.

Action by the plaintiff builder for a lien for monies allegedly owing under a contract for repair and renovation work on the defendants' home. Counter-claim by the defendants for breach of contract and negligence, including failure to properly manage the project. There was no written contract. The parties disagreed about the scope and cost of the work and whether it was a cost-plus or fixed-price contract. The plaintiff argued the contract was a cost-plus agreement, with a 12 per cent management fee. The plaintiff claimed $234,398; the defendants asserted nothing was owed. The defendants' evidence was that in December 2009 the plaintiff estimated the costs of renovation to be $200,000 -- $250,000. On June 24, 2010, the defendants paid $246,000 under a series of preliminary fixed-priced contracts and one cost-plus contract. The next discussion of contracts was on July 29, 2010, at which time the plaintiff wanted to change the ongoing contract to a cost-plus agreement and the defendants initially agreed. The defendants claimed the plaintiff quoted them a cost of $90,700 to complete the project, which constituted a fixed-price agreement, starting July 29. The defendants relied on an itemized list, with figures supplied by the plaintiff and on letters from the plaintiff's counsel that stated a quoted amount of $90,000 was based on estimates of the work requested to that point. The plaintiff denied quoting this amount and asserted the contract began June 24, and included work done from February to May 2010. The plaintiff had also provided the defendants with a printout regarding the total, unpaid project costs on July 29, which alone were over $90,000. The plaintiff relied on his day timer entry on that day that noted a quote of $187,010 -- $189,788. In December 2010, the plaintiff submitted an invoice for $185,154. The defendants asserted the defendant's management fee had been left open and there were also numerous deficiencies in the work. 

HELD: Action by plaintiff allowed.
 Counter-claim by defendants dismissed. There was some understanding between the parties work was to continue after the June 24 invoice; that was the staring date for the disputed contract. As there was no evidence of a preset price or quotation about cost, the circumstances supported a conclusion that the work would be done on a cost-plus basis. There was also at least acquiescence by the defendants that the work included from February to May 2010 would be paid for and this was also part of the cost-plus contract. The letters of the plaintiff's counsel did not support the conclusion the plaintiff had agreed the cost of completing the project would be $90,000. It was more likely than not that the plaintiff had made the entry regarding the quote of $187,010 -- $189,788 on July 29. The list relied on by the defendants was not accurate as to costs. Further, the defendants had failed to adequately review or understand the outstanding costs information from the plaintiff on July 29. The plaintiff had not agreed the project could be completed for $90,700 and it was probable he had provided a quote of 187,010 -- $189,788. Given the defendants had experience with a management fee of 12 per cent on their previous cost-plus agreement, it was likely they were aware it would also apply to the disputed contract. The final December invoice did not end the plaintiff's obligation to address deficiencies. A total of $9,160 in deficiencies were the plaintiff's responsibility. The plaintiff was not negligent in failing to keep high-standard records, or in his management of the project. The lien had not been filed late. The plaintiff was entitled to a lien of $223,178, plus pre- and post-judgment interest.

Reasons for Judgment
J. STEEVES J.
Introduction
1  The plaintiff did some repair and renovation work on the defendants' home in 2010. There were five previous fixed-price contracts and one cost-plus contract between the parties, and there is no issue in this claim on those contracts. A subsequent, seventh contract is very much in dispute. The parties now disagree about the scope and cost of the work as well as whether it was a cost-plus or fixed-price contract. There was no written contract or other written evidence of what was agreed.
2  The plaintiff originally sought a declaration that he is entitled to a lien pursuant to the Builders Lien Act, R.S.B.C. 1997, c. 45 (BLA), in the amount of $228,197.93 against the lands and premises owned by the defendants, among other remedies. At trial the claim was $234,398.03 for materials, labour, a management fee of 12% and taxes. The defendants counterclaim for breach of contract and negligence, including failure to properly manage the project.
3  According to the plaintiff, it had a cost-plus agreement with the defendants to do repairs and renovations to the defendants' home. All of the work was authorized and known to the defendants as was a management fee of 12%. Any deficiencies, as alleged by the defendants, were not significant (such as dust on windows) or they arose because the defendants terminated the contract, thus preventing the plaintiff from completing the project. The amount owed by the defendants became due and owing on October 12, 2011, but the defendants have paid nothing.
4  The defendants' opening and evidence accepted that there was a cost-plus agreement for the work in dispute. In argument, however, they submitted it was a fixed-price contract. With respect to any management fee, it is submitted by the defendants that the plaintiff agreed to forgo that fee until the end of the project and then the defendants could pay what they considered appropriate. They also say that they needed cost certainty; a budget was agreed to and then exceeded by the plaintiff by a significant margin. They were never told the project was over budget and they were not regularly invoiced. Further, the plaintiff failed to properly manage the project, was negligent in performing the work and did not hold sub-trades responsible for damage they caused. Finally, there were deficiencies and some work was not completed at all.
5  The defendants submit that when the agreed contract price is considered with the deficiencies (and with unspecified damages in negligence), they owe no money to the plaintiff.
Background
General
6  The plaintiff, Roger Garside Construction Ltd., is owned and controlled by Roger Garside. He has been in the construction industry for about 47 years. For the last 15 to 20 years he has done renovations and additions on custom homes. I will refer to Mr. Garside as representing the plaintiff. Neither he nor his company has had to come to court before to collect on an account.
7  Mr. Garside, through his company, manages 15 to 20 projects per year; some of them are small and some are in the order of millions of dollars. In general he manages the flow of work and ordering of materials as well as working with engineers and inspectors. The actual work is done by subcontractors that are appropriate for each job. One of the subcontractors is Mr. Garside's son.
8  The plaintiff does work by means of two kinds of contracts. The first is a fixed-price contract whereby the plaintiff prepares estimates or quotations for work on a particular job and then has an agreement with the owner of a property to do the work for a specific price. The second kind of contract is a cost-plus contract. In that case the costs of the materials and subcontracted labour are paid by the owner and the owner also pays a percentage to the plaintiff for managing the contract. The percentage can range from 10% to 15% depending on the size of the contract. A significant amount of the plaintiff's work is done on the basis of cost-plus contracts, sometimes it is 100%.
9  Mr. Garside uses a day timer book to keep track of various tasks in his work. It includes reminders written by Mr. Garside, measurements he has taken, orders he needs to make, phone numbers of subcontractors, some costs, customers and various other matters. As will be seen, it is not a complete or detailed record of all of the work done by Mr. Garside or all of the information related to that work. The plaintiff puts considerable weight on one entry in the day timer as demonstrating a quotation of the cost of the work. This information was only available one week before trial, and it was not available during discovery.
10  Andrew Stirling, one of the defendants, is a helicopter pilot. He has no construction experience to speak of. His work as a helicopter pilot is on a Monday to Friday basis, during the day. On occasion he has to stay overnight when he is travelling for work. Karolyn Jones, the other defendant, works for the Canadian Coast Guard as a Staff Officer. She had some minor construction experience in the past. The two defendants have lived as husband and wife since about 2005.
11  In late 2009, the defendants purchased a new home on Birch Road in the District of Saanich. The defendants remained in their previous home on West Saanich Road until August 2010 while repairs and renovations were completed in the Birch Road property. The latter are the subject of this litigation.
12  According to Mr. Garside's day timer, he met with Ms. Jones at the Birch Road property on November 21, 2009. At that time the defendants were considering buying the property. They wanted to discuss the repairs that would be necessary and they wanted to make some changes. It is agreed that Mr. Garside was asked by Ms. Jones for an estimate of the work and his estimate was $200,000 - $250,000. This figure is not recorded in Mr. Garside's day timer or in any other documents.
13  Over the next few days and into December 2009 there were more meetings and discussions between Mr. Garside and the defendants. Some of these took place at the Birch Road property, some took place at the defendants' West Saanich Road property and others took place in local restaurants. There are detailed lists of various tasks in Mr. Garside's day timer on December 11 and December 12, 2010. On December 12, 2010, there is a note, "160 K Birch Rd." In Mr. Garside's evidence he could not recall the significance of this note.
14  The parties then agreed on five fixed-price contracts on the Birch Road property. They are as follows, according to the dates of the invoices from the plaintiff (the estimates were the same amounts as the ultimate invoice amounts and the dates of the estimates are in brackets):
January 8, 2010 (remove stucco from garage): $7,665.00 (December 16, 2009).
January 8, 2010 (remove exterior cladding and sunroom from house): $45,748.50 (December 16, 2009)
February 16, 2010 (repair rot damage in garage): $2,730.00 (January 15, 2010).
February 16, 2010 (repair rot damage in-house): $28,245.00 (January 15, 2010).
June 24, 2010 (Windows and stucco replacement): $157,720.50 (March 10, 2010).
15  The date of the last of these invoices, June 24, 2010, is of some significance, as discussed below.
16  The defendants also asked the plaintiff to do some work on the West Saanich Road property to get it ready for selling. Mr. Garside sent a crew over and the work was done quickly. The work was billed to the defendants on a cost-plus basis on March 9, 2010. The invoice of that date was for $4,224.42, including a management fee of 15%. There was no estimate for this contract in evidence. The final invoice included a work sheet with the materials and subcontracts listed. The defendants testified that they did not know about the management fee until they received the invoice.
17  For the most part, the above five fixed-price contracts and one cost-plus contract work were completed without any problems, and the defendants promptly paid the amounts owing to the plaintiff. As an example, for the cost-plus contract for work at West Saanich Road, Ms. Jones testified that she was pleased with the work and "happy" to pay the invoice because the work was done quickly and it helped with the sale of the West Saanich property.
18  It is the subsequent arrangement between the parties that is in dispute. The parties have very different versions of the facts of that arrangement, including details of some of the above events and the facts of other events. As well, whether their contractual arrangement was on a cost-plus or fixed-price basis became an issue in argument. I will begin with the plaintiff's version of what occurred and then I will set out the defendants' version.
Plaintiff's evidence
19  As above, Mr. Garside met with Ms. Jones for the first time at the Birch Road property on November 21, 2009.
20  They walked around the property and through the house. Mr. Garside testified that overall the house was in a "leaky condo" situation. There was rot in some of the exterior walls and there had been water damage to the interior wood floors. He was asked for and he provided an estimate of $200,000 - $250,000 for the work that was discussed. He then met with both defendants, and they ultimately agreed on the five fixed-price contracts and the one cost-plus contract. Work proceeded on the Birch Road property with the knowledge of the defendants and the five fixed-price contracts there were completed without any problems.
21  The work on the Birch Road property continued after June 24, 2010, the day the last fixed-price contract was invoiced and paid. According to Mr. Garside, this work was done on the basis of a cost-plus contract that started in June 2010, perhaps May 2010. In his mind it coincided with the end of the last fixed-price contract for the work on the Birch Road property. As below, the defendants say the date was July 29, 2010, and it was a fixed-price contract.
22  Mr. Garside explained in his evidence why the parties proceeded on the basis of a cost-plus contract. He testified that the work on the Birch Road property had come to a stage where there were a number of decisions to be made about floor tiles, fixtures and other things. These required a lot of detail and choices about what, for example, fixtures would be used. Mr. Garside also testified that the defendants were busy, as was he, and everyone felt that the previous contracts had worked well. He suggested a cost-plus contract for the further work because it gave the defendants freedom to select or not select items as the job evolved and blocks of work could be done separately. There was more than one meeting to discuss this idea, according to Mr. Garside. He estimated 10 to 20 meetings over all.
23  According to Mr. Garside, he discussed this with Ms. Jones and she said that his proposal made sense, the parties agreed to proceed on this basis and they agreed to a 12% management fee as well. There is no written contract to this effect, there are no letters, emails or other correspondence, nor is there any reference to a cost-plus agreement in Mr. Garside's day timer. He explained this by saying that, as a result of their previous dealings, the defendants trusted him and he trusted them. Mr. Garside agreed in his evidence that the defendants were concerned with cost.
24  There were a number of meetings to make decisions about various issues such as tiles, painting and landscaping. According to Mr. Garside, there was a lot of talk about costs and he always brought a summary of the costs to date for the defendants to see. There were no invoices from the plaintiff, and there is no evidence that the defendants asked for more information or objected to the cost until as discussed below. The defendants did ask Mr. Garside from time to time if he needed payments, but he declined those offers. Other than the evidence above, there is no other information in Mr. Garside's day timer about costs. As well, as will be seen, the parties do not have clear memories of all of their conversations, in particular the dates and the particulars of those meetings.
25  The defendants retained a designer who prepared reports and options in May 2010. Mr. Garside testified that many changes were made by the defendants after that date including selection of tiles and paint, wood floor, carpet, living room fireplace and a number of others. He also said that he thought that November 10, 2010, was the date when the work on the Birch Road property was substantially complete although there were still some things left to do that were "not minor." These included a countertop in the kitchen and problems with the cabinets.
26  There was an important meeting on July 29, 2010, in which the work was discussed and, according to Mr. Garside, he advised the defendants that the cost would be between $187,010 and $189,788. In his day timer for July 29, 2010, these figures are noted beside "Quoted to Andrew." The plaintiff places considerable weight on this note. It also includes a list of the following work items: flooring, concrete, ceilings, light fixtures, septic, excavating, wiring, flooring and tile, labour, "move pole" and drainage.
27  The plaintiff's day timer was not available for discovery but it was an outstanding request by counsel for the defendants at the end of discovery. However, the request was not recorded by the court reporter, and the absence of the day timer was not noticed by counsel for both parties until one week before trial. At that point the document was disclosed and, for the first time, the quote of $187,010 - $189,788 was known to all. This included Mr. Garside as he had not mentioned the quote in discovery. He testified that a lot of things became known when the day timer was disclosed. The information recorded by Mr. Garside in his day timer is very much in dispute.
28  At the meeting on July 29, 2010, Mr. Garside presented a printout of the costs to that date. This was a 13 page document itemizing the subtrades, materials, permits and the cost for each item. The total cost was $253,757.51. On the front page of this document are two handwritten notes. The first says "meeting" and the second is "$63,969.33." The plaintiff's bookkeeper, Cathy Ogilvie, testified that she made these notes on the document but she could not recall in her evidence why she wrote them.
29  At the meeting the defendants wrote notes on their copy of the printout on the back page including a list of work items totaling $90,700. This is discussed below in detail, but the defendants claim there was agreement on a cost of $90,700 to "get them in their house." In his evidence Mr. Garside said that he never mentioned that figure at the meeting; instead he gave them the above range of $187,010 to $189,788. Further, he testified that he told the defendants that some invoices had not yet been recorded on the printout and some further work that had been discussed was to be completed. It follows from this that the total of $253,757.51 did not represent what the plaintiff said the defendants owed; the amount owed was, according to Mr. Garside, in the range of $187,010 - $189,788 plus any outstanding invoices (plus a management fee and taxes).
30  According to the evidence of Mr. Garside, Mr. Stirling said at the July 29, 2010, meeting he was hoping that the defendants would not have to spend that much money; i.e. $187,010 - $189,788. However, Mr. Garside testified that he was instructed to carry on with the work and if there were any ways to save money, the defendants would like to do that. Mr. Garside also testified that Mr. Stirling said that, when the West Saanich Road house was sold, there would be enough money to complete the project the way the defendants wanted it completed. This latter conversation may have taken place at a later date.
31  Work on the Birch Road property proceeded and the defendants moved into the Birch Road property on August 20, 2010.
32  There was another meeting in November 2010 between Mr. Garside and Mr. Stirling (the parties differ on the date, it may have been November 11 or 19, 2010). Mr. Garside presented a cost summary of numerous pages. This included some of the costs for the previous fixed-price contracts, and Mr. Garside testified that it would now take "considerable work" to calculate the amount owing by the defendants on November 19, 2010, under the cost-plus contract in dispute. He testified that the amount owed was approximately $180,000 at that time, and he told Mr. Stirling this and that there were more bills to come. According to Mr. Garside, Mr. Stirling said that the amount owing was too much and Mr. Garside would have to come and speak to both defendants to explain the costs. In discovery Mr. Garside said the amount discussed as owing was about $150,000. The actual cost printout from this meeting is not available.
33  Mr. Garside was asked in cross-examination whether Mr. Stirling said at this November 2010 that the amount claimed was not what was agreed. Mr. Garside answered that he did not know if Mr. Stirling used those exact words and then he said that Mr. Stirling may have said that the defendants did not agree on that amount. Mr. Garside was also asked whether Mr. Stirling was shocked by the amount claimed, and Mr. Garside replied that Mr. Stirling was unhappy and he said "something like we hoped it would come in less than that", in Mr. Garside's words.
34  A subsequent meeting took place on December 4, 2010. According to Mr. Garside, this was when "things fall apart." There is an entry in Mr. Garside's day timer that suggests that the meeting took place at 10 AM, and in his evidence he said he believed that the meeting took place in the morning. There is another cost summary sheet dated November 29, 2010, and it is likely that Mr. Garside took this to the meeting. This was a 10 page document with a total of $148,115.61. There is another handwritten document prepared by Ms. Ogilvie, the plaintiff's bookkeeper. This is a one-page document showing a total of $185,154.57 as owing by the defendants. A management fee was not included, and Mr. Garside testified that this was done to resolve the contract with the defendants.
35  Mr. Garside testified that the defendants were unhappy, rather than shocked, with this amount. The defendants said at the December 4, 2010, meeting that they would not pay the amounts presented by Mr. Garside. To this, according to Mr. Garside's evidence, he replied that this was the last thing he wanted to happen and he thought that a solution could be found. He asked the defendants what amount they thought was fair. According to him, they replied that they would pay $110,000 and he said he could not accept that.
36  The defendants then said, according to Mr. Garside, that he should take the $110,000 because in one week their offer would be reduced to $90,000 and the following week it would be reduced to $80,000. Mr. Garside refused. He agreed that the defendants wanted finality and he testified that he wanted finality as well. At the December 4, 2010, meeting the defendants raised an issue about the hardwood floors. Mr. Garside offered to take care of the repair cost because he wanted to resolve the situation and he was prepared to, as he testified, take "a bit of a loss." The meeting ended when Mr. Garside was told there would be no payment, Ms. Jones left the room and Mr. Garside was asked to leave.
37  Mr. Garside testified that he decided to leave the issue of costs for a while and look after completing a number of small things on the project. He apparently thought that with the passage of time the issue of cost would resolve. He agreed that the defendants may have called him on February 23, 2011, and offered $110,000 to settle his account.
38  On April 12, 2011, previous counsel for the plaintiff sent a letter to counsel for the defendants. It was signed by Kristen Collishaw, articled student. Among other things the letter says:
The figure of $91,000 that our client quoted in July, 2010 as the projected cost of completing the interior renovations was based on the work that Mr. Stirling and Ms. Jones requested at that point in time. . . .
39  At trial the plaintiff objected to the admissibility of this letter on the basis that it contained discussions between counsel about settlement. I denied the plaintiff's objection on the basis that, although it was in the context of settlement discussions and it did include information about settlement, it also contained a factual assertion that, on its face, appeared to contradict a fact asserted by the plaintiff in the trial. The plaintiff then called Ms. Collishaw as a witness; she is now a lawyer. Her evidence is discussed below.
40  On October 12, 2011, the plaintiff sent to the defendants an invoice in the amount of $238,627.55 for materials and subcontractors from June 30, 2010. Mr. Garside testified that a cost summary would have been sent with this invoice. It was sent some time after the commencement of this action.
41  At trial the plaintiff submitted 108 invoices for materials and labour, beginning February 26, 2010. Mr. Garside testified that these represented the materials and labour for the plaintiff's work at the defendants' Birch Road property. They total $206,627.32. The plaintiff's claim is for this amount, plus a management fee and plus taxes. The total of all costs claimed by the plaintiff at trial is $234,398.03.
Defendant's evidence
42  I next turn to the evidence of the defendants. Mr. Stirling provided the more lengthy evidence.
43  He and Ms. Jones began looking for property sometime in 2009. After looking at a number of properties they settled on the Birch Road house, the subject of the dispute in this case. However, it obviously needed repairs and they wanted some advice about the repairs, including costs, before they made an offer. They were also interested in making some changes to the house. Ms. Jones telephoned Mr. Garside to ask him if he could provide this advice because she had seen the signs for his company in the area.
44  Ms. Jones met Mr. Garside at the Birch Road property on November 21, 2009, late in the morning. Ms. Jones agreed that Mr. Garside's day timer correctly recorded the date although she said they met at 11:00 AM rather than the previously arranged 10:00 AM. There is an arrow in the day timer that is consistent with this.
45  They walked around and inside the house (it was empty) for about 1.5 hours. Ms. Jones testified there were a lot of repairs needed on the house and it was an odd design; "very chalet-ish", as she put it. There was water damage, all the windows needed to be replaced, the kitchen was old and narrow, all the cabinets needed to go, the upstairs fireplace was not working, the bathrooms were old and the fixtures were chipped, there was a hole in the ceiling of one of the bedrooms from water damage, the windows in the sunroom were fogged up and the concrete floor had sunken, all the patios needed to be replaced and there were other problems. She discussed these with Mr. Garside and she asked him for an estimate of the cost for the repairs they discussed. He said $200,000 - $250,000. They did not look at the garage but they agreed that it would require work as well.
46  The defendants testified that the working budget they had for the purchase was $850,000 (Ms. Jones thought it was $750,000 - $850,000) because this was an amount that they could service a mortgage on. Mr. Stirling explained that Ms. Jones liked Mr. Garside, she thought he could do the work that they wanted done and she arranged for a meeting with Mr. Stirling, Mr. Garside and her. In the meantime the defendants had made an offer on the Birch Road property and it had been accepted. The purchase price was $575,000 (the 2013 assessed value is $1,026,000).
47  Mr. Stirling could not remember the date of this meeting but he agreed it was in December 2009. His reference point was the possession date for the Birch Road property of December 16, 2009. The purpose of the meeting was for Mr. Stirling to meet Mr. Garside and to begin a discussion about the work. Mr. Stirling testified that his memory is that the work included new windows, flooring, changes to the kitchen, changes to the interior, patios, stucco (house and garage), and the roof. The defendants had in mind an open interior concept so that they were wondering about removing a wall between the dining room and kitchen and making more access to the family room. As well, the existing furnace was in a small room near the front door and they wondered about opening it up and relocating the furnace. As Mr. Stirling put it in his evidence, it was "basically a whole renovation of the house."
48  Further, Mr. Stirling testified that the discussion was "not so much about details, we were looking for the big picture." Later in his evidence, Mr. Stirling said that Mr. Garside did not break down the various parts of the project when he was discussing it with the defendants. Mr. Garside either offered or he was asked for a cost estimate for the work and he said it would be in the range of $200,000 - $250,000. Mr. Stirling could not remember any other meetings in December 2009; he agreed with Mr. Garside's evidence that there were about 10 to 20 meetings in all. At this same meeting, according to Ms. Jones, the idea of cost-plus contracts was discussed and she said she did not want to proceed on that basis.
49  The parties then agreed to the five fixed-price contracts described above as well as the one cost-plus contract, also discussed above. There were meetings in December 2009, January and into March 2010 about these contracts. The work under these contracts was completed and paid without any apparent difficulties. In his evidence Mr. Stirling said that, with respect to the cost-plus contract above that was a result of the defendants asking Mr. Garside to do some work to get the West Saanich Road house ready for sale. Mr. Stirling testified that the defendants did not know it was to be on a cost-plus basis or that there would be a management fee of 15%. Ms. Jones agreed with this but she was "happy" to pay the invoice because the work had been done quickly to help with the sale of the West Saanich Road property, she did not notice the management fee until later and the amount of the invoice was reasonable.
50  Mr. Stirling described the next discussion about cost with Mr. Garside as occurring on June 24, 2010. This was around the plaintiffs invoice of the same date with respect to the fixed-price contract $157,720.50. The defendants had paid $110,000 on account and they immediately paid the balance owing.
51  Mr. Stirling testified that there may have been some additional work done that was not included in the June 24, 2010, invoice. He could not say for certain and he was "not keeping any records about how the job was proceeding." Mr. Stirling could not "guess" if any work had been going on between June 24 and the next meeting on July 29, 2010. Sometimes he and Ms. Jones would go by the property and see progress was being made; other times nothing seemed to have changed.
52  Mr. Stirling described in his evidence what he called "direct contracts" for a number of things that the defendants contracted directly with suppliers or contractors, rather than paying the plaintiff. These included kitchen cabinets, countertops, lighting fixtures and appliances. The total cost for these items was approximately $60,000.
53  The defendants also testified about design issues and choices the defendants made during the project. These were times during the project when Mr. Garside would say that it was necessary to make a selection about something and the defendants would go to a supplier and make the selection. An example of this is electrical fixtures, and Mr. Stirling stated that he and Ms. Jones made this selection in one day. According to Mr. Stirling, virtually all of these selections were made before the invoice was submitted for the previous cost-plus contract on June 24, 2010. The defendants hired a design consultant and she produced a number of documents dated in May 2010. According to Mr. Stirling, the defendants did not use her after that date or make many changes to the project. Similarly, the defendants used a landscape consultant recommended by Mr. Garside and that work was done in January and February 2010. Other design issues and choices involved the outside patios and sunroom, the driveway and the garden beds. There were small things completed afterwards such as extending the length of the sidewalk because it had not been poured to the plans of the landscape consultant.
54  Early in the discussions between the parties there was the prospect of the defendants buying a boat owned by Mr. Garside, and he took the defendants on a cruise in it in February 2010. It was priced at around $100,000. They were thinking about Mr. Garside's estimate of $250,000 for the work on the Birch Road property, and, on that basis, the defendants thought they would have money available at the end of the work on the Birch Road house to buy the boat. When the defendants received the final fixed-price contract of $157,720.50 on March 10, 2010 (as above), the defendants realized that they could no longer consider buying the boat. Mr. Stirling also testified that at this point (March 2010) the defendants knew that their original budget price had nearly been met.
55  On July 29, 2010, the defendants and Mr. Garside met at a restaurant. Mr. Garside was not sure what time of day it was but he thought his day timer record of a morning meeting was the time. In contrast, Mr. Stirling had medical appointments in the morning, and he testified that the meeting could not have happened before noon.
56  At the July 29, 2010, meeting Mr. Garside presented a printout of the work and materials to that date. This was the 13 page document with a job total of $253,757.51. According to Mr. Stirling, no particular explanation was given for the costs or this amount or the fact that the defendants had already paid approximately $242,000 under the previous contracts. Mr. Garside did not request payment for the total of the worksheets or payment for any amount. Nor did he say how much was owed by the defendants.
57  However, according to Mr. Stirling's evidence, Mr. Garside advised the defendants at the meeting that he had just lost $3,000 on a previous fixed-price contract and he now wanted to change the arrangement he had with the defendants to a cost-plus contract. As above, Mr. Garside testified that the agreement on a cost-plus contract took place in June 2010, perhaps May 2010.
58  Mr. Stirling described Mr. Garside's costs as surprising and unexpected. He testified that most of the time at the meeting of July 29, 2010, was spent on the issue of a cost-plus contract rather than on the 13 page worksheet. The defendants were two weeks away from being able to move in to their Birch Road property and, according to Mr. Stirling, they did not feel they had any choice. Therefore they agreed to a cost-plus contract but they insisted on cost certainty. Mr. Stirling also testified that, with respect to any management fee, Mr. Garside said that it could be 10% or 5% or 0%; the defendants could decide at the end of the job what percentage to pay. This was done because, according to Mr. Stirling, of the defendants "obvious reluctance" to enter into a cost-plus arrangement, to use Mr. Stirling's words. They preferred a fixed-price contract.
59  Mr. Stirling testified that nobody was being very clear at the July 29, 2010, meeting about how to complete the work and he started to make specific suggestions. He described a list that he and Ms. Jones wrote on the last page of the July 29, 2010, cost sheet and on the back of that page. The list on the back of the last page was primarily written by Mr. Stirling and I reproduce it as follows:

60  In his evidence Mr. Stirling said that the items on the left-hand side of the list were the items that needed to be completed to finish the job. These were discussed with Mr. Garside. The cost for countertops ($10,000) and kitchen cabinetry ($20,000) were to be paid directly by the defendants to the contractors for those items and the pagoda ($3,000) was never built. Ms. Jones confirmed this in her evidence.
61  The numbers under the heading "EST" were provided by Mr. Garside. The total of $90,700 was calculated by Mr. Stirling. He testified that he asked Mr. Garside whether the amount of $90,700 was "the cost it would take to get us into the house." Mr. Garside agreed to this, according to Mr. Stirling. The calculation at the top right, "MONIES", was Mr. Stirling's. He used the amount of $360,000 as the amount available to the defendants, he deducted a rounded up amount of $254,000 (from the worksheets) and then deducted the amount of $90,700. The balance of $15,300 "showed" the defendants that they had enough money to do the job. On this basis, as explained by Mr. Stirling in his evidence, they instructed Mr. Garside to go ahead. Mr. Garside was not taking notes, nor did he have his day timer with him at this meeting, again according to Mr. Stirling.
62  As above, Mr. Garside's day timer for July 29, 2010, says that the amount of $187,010 to $189,788 was "Quoted to Andrew." Mr. Stirling denied in his evidence that Mr. Garside gave that quote on July 29, 2010. Further, according to Mr. Stirling, the first time he learned of that amount was a week before this trial commenced in May 2013 when he had the opportunity, through his counsel, to see a copy of Mr. Garside's day timer. As above, this document had been requested in discovery but, through an error of the court reporter, the request was not recorded in the transcript.
63  The next meeting of significance according to Mr. Stirling was one held in a restaurant in November 2010. He met with Mr. Garside without Ms. Jones. At this meeting Mr. Garside presented another worksheet showing the defendants owed about $152,000. According to Mr. Stirling he was "visibly shocked" with this number, and he asked Mr. Garside to take it back, to check his numbers and to prepare another worksheet that was consistent with their previous conversation on July 29, 2010. That new worksheet was to be presented to Mr. Stirling and Ms. Jones at another meeting. Mr. Stirling could not remember the reasons given by Mr. Garside for the cost of $152,000. He did recall that Mr. Garside was "blaming" Ms. Jones for all the changes she made. To this Mr. Stirling asked Mr. Garside not to speak badly of Ms. Jones.
64  The next meeting was held on December 4, 2010, with both defendants and Mr. Garside. Mr. Stirling testified that Mr. Garside presented a one-page handwritten document with the current costs on it. It showed that the defendants owed $185,154.57 for material, labour and taxes.
65  Mr. Stirling testified that there was "no mistaking" that he and Ms. Jones were "dumbfounded" because the amount was supposed to be less than $152,000 and now it was $30,000 more than what was discussed recently. The defendants asked how this could be possible. Mr. Stirling testified that Mr. Garside "talked a lot" but Mr. Stirling could not recall Mr. Garside's reasoning. Mr. Stirling also testified that Mr. Garside was not making any sense. In addition, Mr. Stirling said that the one-page document presented by Mr. Garside at the July 29, 2010, meeting did not include any management fee because Mr. Garside said he was forgoing that fee.
66  The defendants agreed that the meeting ended when Ms. Jones left the room. However, according to Mr. Stirling, there was still room for discussion and negotiation. They deny they told Mr. Garside that they would not pay him anything. Mr. Stirling also denied in his evidence that the defendants said at any meeting, or in any conversation, that Mr. Garside should accept the $110,000 because the following week the offer would be $90,000 and the week after that it would be $80,000. At the December 4, 2010, meeting Mr. Garside asked what amount could the defendants pay that day, and Ms. Jones testified that thought that she did not want to give him anything. She also testified that Mr. Garside suggested that the defendants "pay what we had and then go into personal debt with him" for the balance. She found this upsetting and left the meeting to go upstairs.
67  Mr. Stirling testified that, after the meeting on December 4, 2010, things remained amicable with Mr. Garside. For example, in December 2010 the defendants needed help installing a new fridge that was to be delivered. Mr. Stirling "felt comfortable", as he put it, calling Mr. Garside and asking him to help, which he did (and he was paid by the supplier).
68  On February 23, 2011, Mr. Stirling telephoned Mr. Garside to offer $110,000 to settle the defendants' account. Mr. Garside declined this offer. Mr. Stirling wrote a note about the conversation on the back of the worksheet described above (that has the cost at $90,700). Mr. Stirling also recorded that Mr. Garside told him in this conversation that he wanted to make sure that the Birch Road house was right for the defendants. Mr. Stirling presented this as a positive statement from Mr. Garside.
69  As above, the defendants have been in their Birch Road home since August 2010. Mr. Stirling testified about a number of deficiencies as a result of the work of the plaintiff. These are discussed in more detail below. In summary they include cupping of the wooden floors, damage to the exterior stucco, problems with the stain on the front door, nail pops and cracks in the drywall, gaps in the molding on the exterior of the windows, screen doors that do not open or do not open properly, problems with the in-floor heating in the bathroom, problems with flashing around skylights and coldness and drafts in the closet in the master bedroom. Photographs of some of these issues were entered in evidence. As well, the defendants hired another contractor to repair some deficiencies and record others that still need repairing. This contractor also testified.
70  There is also the issue of what type of contract was in place after June 24, 2010. Mr. Stirling emphasized that the defendants did not agree to a cost-plus contract until July 29, 2010. As above, Mr. Garside testified that the cost-plus arrangement began in June 2010. Mr. Stirling was also concerned that the defendants never received a written estimate of the cost of the work to be done and they were not told how frequently they would be billed. And he denied, as asserted by Mr. Garside, that the defendants agreed that any of the work or materials prior to July 29, 2010, were to be included in the cost-plus contract that commenced on that date. In her evidence, Ms. Jones was asked in cross-examination about the nature of the contract between the parties after the meeting on July 29, 2010, and she ultimately agreed it was a fixed-price contract.
71  Finally, according to Mr. Stirling the defendants expected to be in the Birch Road house in March or April 2010. However it was not until August 2010 that this happened. Mr. Stirling testified that Mr. Garside did not raise the issue of the late occupancy: he also could not specifically recall asking Mr. Garside about it. And, at times Mr. Garside was unavailable to the defendants because he was at his vacation property in the interior or he was working on other projects.
Claim and counterclaim
72  On May 13, 2011, the plaintiff filed its notice of civil claim.
73  The relief sought includes a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to a lien against the Birch Road property in the amount of $228,197.93 (as above, at trial the plaintiff seeks $234,398.03, composed of materials, labour, a management fee of 12% and taxes). Other relief claimed includes an Order that the defendants pay the amount claimed and, in default, an Order that the property be sold to realize the amount of the claim.
74  A counterclaim was filed by the defendants on June 10, 2011.
75  The defendants' allege in their counterclaim that the plaintiff failed to properly manage the project and this resulted in damage and loss. Further, the work performed by the plaintiff resulted in damage and loss to the defendants, and the plaintiff owed the defendants a duty to complete the work in a professional and workmanlike manner. The plaintiff failed in this duty and did not meet the industry standards required for the performance of this duty. The relief sought by the defendants includes damages for breach of contract, a claim of set-off and other relief.
76  In a response to the counterclaim, filed June 10, 2011, the plaintiff stated, among other things:
The Plaintiff denies that the parties agreed that the cost of completing the project would not exceed $90,000. This figure was an estimate that the Plaintiff provided to the defendants as the cost of the project based on the scope of the work requested by the Defendants at that point in time. . .
77  The legal basis of the plaintiff's response on the counterclaim was the BLA, the law of contract and the law of quantum meruit.
Expert evidence
78  The defendants obtained an expert opinion from a document examiner with regards to the statement in the plaintiff's day timer on July 29, 2010, "Quoted to Andrew $187,010 - $189,788 flooring - flooring and tile . . ." This was described as "exhibit Q1" in the examiner's report.
79  The document examiner was J.M. Kovacs and his report is dated June 10, 2013. Mr. Kovacs worked for many years with the RCMP doing examination of documents, he has lectured on the subject and he has been an expert witness in this and other courts. Mr. Kovacs was not cross-examined.
80  The purpose of his examination was to "To conduct an examination of the question entry on exhibit Q1 with respect to the probability of the entry being made at the same time as the surrounding entries." The line quality of the entry in question was analyzed and Mr. Kovacs described "a freely and clearly written entry with a good overall line quality which means that the physical conditions would have been a stable surface for the book to rest on and ample arm support for the writing."
81  Mr. Kovacs conclusion was as follows:
I am not able to determine the sequence that the question entry was made on July 29, 2010... or the correctness of the indicated time of the entry. The question handwritten entry shows all the features normally associated with a carefully executed handwriting.
Analysis
82  The issues in this case are largely factual ones relating to the nature of the contract between the parties, the cost of the work under that contract, the cost of management fees and the cost of any deficiencies. There are also issues relating to the defendants' allegation of negligence against the plaintiff, the timeliness of the plaintiff's filing of a lien and issues about pre and post-judgment interest.
83  I begin by identifying some facts that are not in dispute and others where I have identified the different positions of the parties:
The defendants purchased a new home on Birch Road. The possession date was December 16, 2009, and they moved into the home on or about August 20, 2010. They had been living in another home on West Saanich Road before moving to Birch Road. The former home was sold in the summer of 2010.
The Birch Road home required extensive repairs and the defendants wished to make changes as well. These were reviewed generally with the plaintiff in November 2009, before the home was purchased, and the plaintiff estimated that the cost would be $200,000-$250,000.
The plaintiff contracted with the defendants to repair and renovate the Birch Road home by means of five fixed-price contracts. The defendants agreed to these contracts on the basis of detailed quotations of the work and prices. The total cost of these five contracts was $242,109.00
The plaintiff also contracted with the defendants to work on the West Saanich Road home to get it ready for sale. This was by means of a cost-plus contract that included a management fee of 15%. The invoice for this contract included a printout of the costs for materials and labour. The cost of this contract was $4,224.42.
There were no problems between the parties with regards to these contracts. Indeed, as Ms. Jones testified with regards to the cost-plus contract, the defendants were pleased with the work and "happy" to pay the plaintiff for the work. The total cost of the above six contracts was $246,333.42.
The parties agreed on a second contract with regards to further work on the Birch Road house. The plaintiff believes that this contract started in June 2010, possibly even May 2010 but the defendants say that it started on July 29, 2010 at a meeting that day.
The plaintiff is clear this was a cost-plus contract. In their opening and evidence the defendants agreed it was a cost-plus contract. However, during argument they changed their position and submitted that it was a fixed-price contract.
There were meetings between the parties on costs on July 29, 2010, in November 2010, and on December 4, 2010.
At no point did any of the parties say that the work was over budget until November 11, 2010, or that the work should stop for that reason.
Mr. Garside had a day timer that included some information about his dealings with the defendants. On July 29, 2010, it has the note "Quoted to Andrew $187,010 - $189,788", and Mr. Garside testified that he said that to the defendants on that date. The day timer was not available until after discovery and Mr. Garside did not explain the quote for $187,010 - $189,788 until after the day timer was disclosed, a week before trial. The defendants deny that the quote of $187,010 - $189,788 was given on July 29, 2010.
The defendants took notes at the meeting of July 29, 2010. These include a list of work items to be completed with cost figures beside them. The total is $90,700. They say Mr. Garside agreed to complete the work for that amount. Mr. Garside denies he said that at the meeting on July 29, 2010.
There is no other written record of the discussions or agreements between the parties after June 24, 2010, the date the last fixed-price contract was completed and paid.
On October 11, 2011, the plaintiff sent an invoice to the defendants in the amount of $238,627.55. This included management fees of $23,140.98 (at 12%), taxes and costs for materials and subcontractors.
The defendants allege deficiencies in the work of the plaintiff and that all of the contracted work was not completed by the plaintiff. They also allege negligence on the part of the plaintiff. The plaintiff denies there were deficiencies or that it was negligent.
84  I now turn to the issues in dispute between the parties: the nature of the contract between them; the cost and scope of the work; any management fee; any deficiencies; negligence; the timeliness of the filing of the lien; and the issues of pre and post-judgment interest.
The contract
85  There are two issues with respect to the contract between the parties I will attempt to address here: when did the contract commence; and was it a fixed-price or cost-plus contract? I will deal with the issue of cost, including whether the contract included a management fee, separately below.
86  There is disagreement between the parties about when the contract in dispute commenced. Mr. Garside testified that it started about the end of June, when the last fixed-price contract was completed. That contract was invoiced and paid on June 24, 2010. In contrast the defendants submit that it started on July 29, 2010, when they met with Mr. Garside and, as they contend, agreed on the contract price of $90,700. Again, there is no written document to explain the date the contract started.
87  The difficulty with the July 29, 2010, date as the commencement of the contract is that there is no question that work on the Birch Road property continued after June 24, 2010. Mr. Garside testified that a cost-plus contract (as he described it) started about June 24, 2010, but it may have also started in May 2010. The defendants simply deny that there was any discussion about a contract until July 29, 2010. However, on June 24, 2010, the work that the defendants wanted done on the Birch Road property was not complete, and it carried on for at least one month prior to the July 29, 2010 meeting with the knowledge of the defendants. In his evidence Mr. Stirling agreed that the work on the Birch Road property carried over past the end of the last fixed-price contract in June 2010.
88  I conclude that there was some understanding or acquiescence around June 24, 2010, that the work would continue and would be paid for. It may have been that the previously successful contracts between the parties led them to simply carry on the work with the expectation that it would be paid for. That approach has obviously created difficulties for both parties; their lack of communication has contributed greatly to the problems in this case. It may also have been, as Mr. Stirling said in his evidence, that the defendants at least were just looking at the "big picture." In any event, I find that there was a contractual relationship between the parties on or about June 24, 2010.
89  What then was the contractual relationship on or about June 24, 2010?
90  In this litigation the parties initially agreed that the contract in dispute between them was a cost-plus one. Both parties presented their evidence on that basis. This would have been the second such contract after the cost-plus contract for the work on the West Saanich Road house in March 2010 to get that house ready for sale. That contract was completed and paid without any difficulties.
91  The dispute over the nature of the contract after June 2010 arose in evidence. The defendants had always asserted that, in their dealings with the plaintiff, they wanted cost certainty and, in fact, the plaintiff agreed that costs were always an issue. The problem arose because the evidence of the defendants was that the agreement was a cost-plus contract (as of July 29, 2010) but with a fixed-price of $90,700 and with a fixed list of work to be done. When pressed on this in cross-examination it was accepted that the contract they had in mind was really a fixed-price one. Then, in argument, the defendants submitted that the work done was pursuant to a fixed-price contract, contrary to their opening. The plaintiff says the contract was a cost-plus one.
92  There is no disagreement as to what a cost-plus contract is and what a fixed-price contract is. The former has been defined as "A contract to sell a product or perform work for the selling price or contractor's cost-plus a percentage or plus a fixed fee." A fixed-price contract is a "Contract in which the price is preset regardless of the actual cost" (Daphne Dukelow, Pocket Dictionary of Canadian Law, 3rd ed.(Toronto: Carswell, 2002). These definitions accord with the way the parties acted with the five fixed-price contracts and one cost-plus contract they previously completed with success.
93  Therefore, it is necessary to review what occurred between the parties between June 2010 and the end of 2010, in particular what happened on July 29, 2010.
94  First, on or about June 24, 2010, I find that there was an understanding or acquiescence that the work on the Birch Road property was not complete. Further, it would continue and it would be paid for. There was no preset price or quotation about cost that is in evidence. I conclude that the circumstances at this time support a conclusion that the work would be done on a cost-plus basis.
95  Another aspect of the contract between the parties beginning June 24, 2010, is that some work claimed by the plaintiff took place before that date, including work in February, March, April and May 2010. That is, work that might be expected to have been included in the five fixed-price contracts for the Birch Road property is being claimed by the plaintiff as part of the cost-plus contract that was in place from about June 24, 2010. The defendants oppose this claim and disagree they accepted or agreed to this. However, the work continued and, if there was not an express agreement, there was at least acquiescence that the work would be paid for by the defendants. I conclude that the cost for this work was part of the cost-plus contract between the parties.
96  There is then the meeting of July 29, 2010. The defendants now submit that the contract they had with the plaintiff was a fixed-price contract: it was for a fixed cost ($90,700) and for a fixed list of work items. In contrast, the plaintiff says the relationship continued as a cost-plus contract. I pause to note that there is no reason in law why parties cannot change their contract from a cost-plus one to a fixed-price one, or vice versa. The question is whether that happened on July 29, 2010.
97  It is clear that the defendants believed on July 29, 2010, that they had cost certainty by getting an agreement on the amount of $90,700. On the other hand the plaintiff's position is that, on July 29, 2010, a quote of $187,010 - $189,788 was given. Mr. Garside testified this quote was not a preset price but it was an amount that provided some cost certainty to the defendants.
98  The issue of whether the parties had a fixed-price or cost-plus contract is intricately related to what happened on July 29, 2010, and whether the plaintiff agreed to a fixed-price contract in the amount of $90,700 or whether the defendants agreed to a cost-plus contract with a quoted cost of $187,010 - $189,788.
99  I now turn to that issue.
Cost
100  As above, it is agreed that on November 20, 2009, at a first meeting between Mr. Garside and Ms. Jones at the Birch Road property, Mr. Garside was asked for an estimate of the cost of the work discussed and he replied with an estimate of $200,000 - $250,000.
101  The parties then entered into the five fixed-price contracts and one cost-plus contract, which totalled $246,333.42. The last of these contracts ended on or about June 24, 2010, when the defendants paid a total of $157,720.50 for the last fixed-price contract on the Birch Road property. If the cost of the work on the West Saanich Road property ($4,224.42) under the cost-plus contract is deducted from the total cost (because Mr. Garside's estimate in November 2009 related only to the Birch Road property), by June 24, 2010, the defendants had paid to the plaintiff an amount of $242,109.00 for work on the Birch Road property.
102  I therefore conclude that there can be little doubt that the defendants knew that the original estimate of $200,000 - $250,000 for the work on the Birch Road property was met in June 2010. A simple addition of the contracts to that date would have demonstrated that fact.
103  I also conclude that, after June 24, 2010, the defendants accepted that the work would continue and the cost would increase beyond the original estimate of $200,000 - 250,000. Clearly the scope of the work expanded from the original discussion in November 2009, it continued after June 24, 2010, and somehow it had to be paid for. The heart of the dispute between the parties on cost is how much more than the original estimate of $200,000 - $250,000 is to be paid by the defendants.
104  This came to a head on July 29, 2010, when, according to the defendants, the amount of $90,700 was agreed at a meeting in a local restaurant. On the other hand, Mr. Garside says he "quoted" the amount of $187,010 - $189,788. Both parties have documents that they say support their respective positions. The difficulty, of course, is how could the parties come away from the same meeting with very different understandings of what was agreed?
105  I therefore turn to the issue of what was discussed and agreed between the parties on July 29, 2010, with respect to cost.
106  The plaintiff relies on the day timer entry for July 29, 2010, that says "Quoted to Andrew $187,010 - $189,788." He testified that this is what he said at the meeting in the restaurant that day.
107  The day timer is not a complete list of all of Mr. Garside's appointments or all of his work. It is primarily notes that serve as reminders for things such as ordering supplies, telephone calls to make, measurements taken, list of work items at certain jobs and so on. Mr. Garside could not recall the significance of some notes at all and, in other cases, he could not recall details. Other things were not recorded in the day timer. For example, there is no note that the defendants moved into the Birch Road house on or about August 20, 2010. As well, there are no meetings noted in November 2010, and it is accepted that that is when Mr. Garside met with Mr. Stirling to present the cost figure of about $152,000. This figure was rejected by Mr. Stirling, and he asked for the meeting with Ms. Jones. The parties then met on December 4, 2010, and that is when, according to Mr. Garside, the contract ended. The only reference to this in the day timer is a note at 10 AM on December 4, 2010, "Carolyn [sic] Andrew."
108  Overall, while there are omissions, there are no apparent errors of any significance in the day timer, unless the note on July 29, 2010, "Quoted to Andrew $187,010 - $189,788" was an error, as submitted by the defendants.
109  The defendants take issue with the time listed for this entry on July 29, 2010. It is located on the page beside 7:30 or 7:45 AM but it does not appear to be noted at a specific time. The note "Quoted to Andrew $187,010 - $189,788" is followed by a list of work items such as "flooring" and "concrete". At the end of the list is "Bill at Slegg [Lumber]" and 10:00 AM is circled. Mr. Stirling testified that he attended medical appointments the morning of July 29, 2010, and the meeting could not have taken place before late morning or early afternoon. I accept this is a more specific memory of the meeting than that of Mr. Garside. Beyond that I am unable to conclude that any other differences between the parties about the time of the meeting on July 29, 2010, are of great significance.
110  The defendants' challenge to the note in the day timer on July 29, 2010, includes the use of an expert document examiner, and I have the benefit of his report. His opinion was inconclusive as to whether the statement in question was made at a different time than the "surrounding entries." It was written on a stable surface and I conclude that could have been a table, including one in the restaurant where the meeting took place. That, however, is not decisive. It is also apparent that there is no dispute that the note in question was written by Mr. Garside.
111  In summary, I can find nothing in the expert report that contradicts the evidence of Mr. Garside and his record in the day timer that he said "Quoted to Andrew $187,010 - $189,788" at the meeting on July 29, 2010.
112  There are then the circumstances of the day timer being disclosed. As above, as a result of an error by the court reporter at the discovery of Mr. Garside, counsel did not have the day timer until one week before trial. Further, Mr. Garside did not remember the reference to "Quoted to Andrew $187,010 - $189,788" until after he had reviewed the day timer; that is, until after discovery. This is noteworthy because one would expect that a person would recall, without the prompting of the day timer, an important matter such as a quote about cost while in litigation about that issue. Mr. Garside did not remember the entry in the day timer until it was disclosed and his memory on a number of areas in his evidence was similarly not good. On the other hand the evidence is that he wrote the entry.
113  Turning to another matter that may be relevant to the day timer entry on July 29, 2010, of a quote of $187,010 - $189,788, there are other numbers about the cost of the work attributed to Mr. Garside at other times. On April 12, 2011, his previous counsel wrote to counsel for the defendants to say, among other things, "The figure of $91,000 that our client quoted in July, 2010 as the projected cost of completing the interior renovations was based on work that Mr. Stirling and Ms. Jones requested at that point in time." The context of the letter was settlement discussions between counsel.
114  The author of this letter was Kristen Collishaw, an articling student in April 2011; she is now a barrister and solicitor. The plaintiff called her as a witness and she testified that her principal at the time was away on holiday for an extended period so she was handling the plaintiff's file. She talked to the plaintiff before writing the April 12, 2011 letter, and her notes say "Roger did not recall" the amount of $91,000. Ms. Collishaw said in her evidence that her letter had not been careful or drafted well. She said the letter should have said, "If in fact the $91,000 quoted . . ." In cross-examination she said that her notes did not indicate that the plaintiff gave any figure and she could not remember him doing so.
115  A related matter is that the plaintiff's previous counsel also filed a counterclaim on his behalf, dated June 27, 2011. Paragraph 3 of the counterclaim contained the following:
The Plaintiff denies that the parties agreed that the cost of completing the project would not exceed $90,000.00. This figure was an estimate that the Plaintiff provided to the Defendants as the cost of completing the project based on the scope of the work requested by the Defendants at that point in time. This estimate was at all times subject to change as the scope of the work changed.
116  I am urged by the defendants to find that the statements in the April 12, 2011, letter and the counterclaim prove that their estimate of $90,700 was the amount of money agreed to by the plaintiff on July 29, 2010, to complete the work on the Birch Road property. However, the evidence of Ms. Collishaw does not support that proposition and, indeed, it contradicts it. As well, I note that her letter of April 11, 2011, was not copied to Mr. Garside. His uncontradicted evidence is that he knew there were discussions going on between counsel but he did not know the details. Finally, taken on their own, the two statements describe an "estimate" or quotation by the plaintiff, subject to change. It is true that the estimate or quote was in an amount similar to the amount relied on by the defendants but it was not an agreed contract price.
117  I am not persuaded that the reference to $91,000 in the April 11, 2011, letter and the reference to a similar amount in the plaintiff's counterclaim support the conclusion that the plaintiff agreed with the defendants on July 29, 2010, that the cost of completing the work would be that amount.
118  In summary, the matter is not without difficulty, but I conclude that the evidence (including expert evidence) supports a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the entry "Quoted to Andrew $187,010 - $189,788" was made by Mr. Garside and it was made on July 29, 2010. His oral that he said this evidence corroborates the entry in the day timer. That evidence was prompted by the disclosure of the day timer but, again, despite a serious challenge by the defendants to the entry on July 29, 2010, it remains as credible evidence.
119  There is then the number of $90,700 relied on by the defendants as the cost agreed between the parties on July 29, 2010, to complete the work.
120  It may be recalled that this number was the total of costs recorded by Mr. Stirling on the back of the printout provided by Mr. Garside. The costs included specific items such as handrails, floors (wood, carpet, and tile), bath towel holders, lighting and so on. According to the defendants, they came away from the July 29, 2010, meeting with an agreement with Mr. Garside that the itemized work would be completed for $90,700 so that they could move into the Birch Road house. That move was imminent and, in fact, it took place on or about August 20, 2010. In his evidence Mr. Stirling agreed that the defendants asked Mr. Garside what amount of money it would take so that they could move in. However, the intent was to get a number that would complete the work.
121  As a starting point, I accept that the notes written on the back of the cost printout were made by Mr. Stirling. It is also probable that the numbers written beside each item came from Mr. Garside. And there is no disputing that the total is $90,700. Further, in cross-examination Mr. Garside agreed that the defendants "may have asked" whether the work could be completed for $90,700 but he never agreed with that number. What is in dispute is what this number represents.
122  One difficulty with the proposition that $90,700 was the agreed total to complete the work is that the list recorded by Mr. Stirling included two items that the defendants contracted for directly and paid directly to the suppliers. These were the countertop at a cost of $10,000 and the cabinets at a cost of $20,000. Logically, these costs were not the plaintiff's. Therefore, the total of $90,700 that includes these costs cannot represent the plaintiff's cost to complete the work.
123  As well, the defendants' figure of $90,700 left out some costs. There was the work done by the plaintiff between June 24, 2010, (and even before that date) and July 29, 2010, under what I have found above was a cost-plus contract. I also accept the evidence of Mr. Garside that not all of the invoices for completed work had been received by him and that he told the defendants this on July 29, 2010.
124  Some examples of the work not included in the $90,700 amount are evident on the printout presented by Mr. Garside at the July 29, 2010, meeting. There was a cost for stucco of $9,591.55, entered in the plaintiff's tracking system on July 22, 2010. There were also charges for recycling (drywall and garbage) totaling $3,710.66, beginning in January 2010 and the last one recorded was July 17, 2010. The cost for electrical wiring was entered in the tracking system on May 13, 2010, and the cost of an electrical furnace "system" was entered on April 28, 2010. These costs were $11,700 and $5,500, respectively.
125  The defendants respond to this by saying a number of things were done without their knowledge or authorization. For example, the furnace was removed and replaced in a different location, and Mr. Stirling testified that the first time he knew about this was when he asked about an empty cardboard box that had contained the new furnace. However, one of the original conversations the defendants had with the plaintiff was about the furnace. It had originally been in a small room beside the front door, and the defendants wanted it moved to open up the front area of the Birch Road house. Further, the evidence is that the defendants were obviously interested in the work on their new home. They attended from time to time and it is highly unlikely that they would not have noticed that the old furnace room had been removed and replaced as had been discussed from the beginning. I therefore conclude that the defendants knew about the new furnace.
126  Similarly, the defendants knew about the new wiring in new walls or to accommodate the removal of old walls, including media cables. It is not reasonable to suggest, as Mr. Stirling did in his evidence, that existing wiring from an older house could have been used again. Certainly, as described in the evidence of the cable wire installer, Michael Jennings, the defendants' request for satellite television service could not be met using wiring of that vintage.
127  I pause to note that separating out what work was done before or after June 24, 2010, is difficult because there is little evidence describing the sequence of the work and all of the parties had unreliable memories about the different stages of the work. There are the plaintiff's printouts of the cost of materials and labour. These set out the cost of specific subcontractors and specific material suppliers but the order is not necessarily the order that the work was done. I also take this opportunity to note that the printouts do not always represent the actual amount owed by the defendants. That is a separate calculation, and Mr. Garside testified that it would have taken "considerable time" to separate what was owed by the defendants on one of the printouts.
128  Apart from context, the significance of this is that the defendants may have, reasonably, taken the final amounts on the printouts as the amount they owed the plaintiff. In fact the final amount could be less than the total on the printout because there were invoices to come; the final amount could also be more than the total on the printout because some costs from the previous fixed-price contracts were included. For example, at the July 29, 2010, meeting Mr. Garside presented a printout that had total costs in excess of $250,000, but his evidence is that he said at the meeting that $187,010 - $189,788 would complete the project (subject to any invoices not yet recorded).
129  The defendants expressed some concern in their evidence that they had not been aware of the costs accruing on the project. In this regard, the evidence is that Mr. Garside presented the first printout of his costs on July 29, 2010, about one month after the last fixed-price contract was completed on June 24, 2010. His evidence is that he kept the defendants up to date on costs throughout the project, but the evidence is that the first printout of costs was provided on July 29, 2010. I do not agree with the defendants that the plaintiff should have presented information about costs earlier than about one month. On the other hand, the defendants concern that the plaintiff did not provide an actual invoice until October 2011 is well taken. In his evidence Mr. Garside said there was no real explanation for this. In any event, the defendants knew on July 29, 2010, that the printout of that date recorded costs in excess of $250,000.
130  The evidence includes two other documents related to the plaintiff's costs. The next one was at the meeting in November 2010 between Mr. Stirling and Mr. Garside; the latter presented a printout and Mr. Garside said (in discovery) an amount of $152,000 was owed by the defendants. Mr. Stirling rejected that out of hand, and the actual printout is not available. There is also a hand written sheet that Mr. Garside presented at the meeting on December 4, 2010. It recorded an amount of $185,154.57 owed by the defendants to the plaintiff, and it was prepared by the plaintiff's bookkeeper.
131  It is unfortunately the case that the defendants did not review the plaintiff's printouts in any detail or at all. Both defendants testified that, with regards to the printout from July 29, 2010, they did not read it at the meeting on that day or later. Ms. Jones could not recall if Mr. Garside explained at the meeting the costs in the printout; Mr. Stirling testified that Mr. Garside explained some parts of the printout. I find that Mr. Garside did review the printout of costs at the meeting (although it is unlikely he reviewed the entire 13 page document). At one point Mr. Stirling testified that Mr. Garside did not make any sense when he was explaining the printout, but Mr. Stirling also could not remember what he said. It was certainly open to the defendants to review the printout at the meeting or afterwards. As above this was not necessarily an accurate statement of what was owed, but it was a detailed statement of what work was done, what materials were used, when the invoices were received by the plaintiff and who did the work or supplied the materials.
132  The defendants did not review the printout given to them on July 29, 2010, and the reasons for this are not explained. However, there can be no real dispute that information to explain the costs that had been accruing up to July 29, 2010, was available to the defendants on that date. More significantly, those costs were more than $90,700 to complete the project if they were combined with the list prepared by Mr. Stirling at the meeting on July 29, 2010. Unfortunately, the defendants missed an opportunity to understand the actual costs for the work on their house.
133  A further concern of the defendants is that they say that their budget was exceeded on July 29, 2010, and the plaintiff knew it was exceeded. To the extent that this is a comment on the plaintiff's November 2009 estimate of $200,000 - $250,000 this is correct. However, the defendants knew this in June 2010 after the completion of the last fixed-price contract. They knew more work was required and they either authorized it or acquiesced in it proceeding.
134  Part of the defendants' submission on their budget involves their early interest in purchasing a boat owned by the Mr. Garside at a cost of about $100,000. The significance of this is that the defendants' budget was $750,000 - $850,000 to purchase the Birch Road property and do the renovations. The purchase price for the property was $575,000 and the balance was available for the renovations. On this basis the original estimate by Mr. Garside in November 2010 of $200,000 - $250,000 made sense for the defendants and left open the option to buy the boat. There is logic to these calculations.
135  However, the evidence is that Mr. Garside was not told by the defendants that he had a budget to work with until July 29, 2010. However, the evidence is not clear that Mr. Stirling's notes on that date about the defendants' budget were explained or disclosed to Mr. Garside. In addition, there was the cost of the work from June 24, 2010, to July 29, 2010, that was ongoing and substantial. With regards to the boat, there is no evidence that the defendants said to the plaintiff that they could not buy the boat because the cost of the project had surpassed a budget amount. I cannot interpret that decision to mean that the plaintiff had detailed knowledge of the defendants' budget and violated that budget. For these reasons I find that, until July 29, 2010, there was an open-ended budget, as would be consistent with the cost-plus contract for that period.
136  In summary, up to July 29, 2010, the contractual arrangement between the parties was a cost-plus one and the defendants knew or ought to have known this. It appears that the defendants prepared a list of costs on July 29, 2010, that reflected what they wanted done to complete the project. However, the list was not based on the plaintiff's printout of costs; it included costs that were not the plaintiff's and it did not include work that had actually been done and not yet been billed. I accept that Mr. Garside provided the numbers used by the defendants for their list but I am unable to find that he agreed that the project could be completed for the total of that list of $90,700. In short, it is probable that the defendants prepared and acted on an inaccurate and incomplete list of costs.
137  This is another matter that is not without difficulty, but I find it is probable that Mr. Garside provided a range of $187,010 - $189,788 as a quote to Mr. Stirling on July 29, 2010, to complete the work. The defendants did not need to agree to that quote but I find it was available for them to consider, as was the detailed but not necessarily complete printout of costs to date. It follows that there was no agreement that the project would be completed for $90,700.
138  I return to the issue of the nature of the contract between the parties. As discussed above, the parties were certainly not clear about their contractual relations and no specific legal definition is a perfect fit. I have found above that the contract between the parties from June 2010 to July 29, 2010, was a cost-plus one. To the extent there is a need to define the contract after July 29, 2010, I conclude that it continued as a cost-plus arrangement but with the proviso that the cost would be $187,010 - $189,788. To be clear that amount was a quote rather than an agreed contract price. It represented the plaintiff's commitment to complete the items listed by Mr. Stirling, but it also included other costs. And the nature of a quote is that it may change.
139  There are other matters that relate to the discussions between the parties. First, there is the plaintiff's allegation that the defendants told him on December 4, 2010, that he should accept their offer of $110,000 or the next week it would be $90,000 and the following week it would be $80,000. There is also the defendants' statement that the plaintiff proposed a cost-plus contract on July 29, 2010, because he had just lost $3,000 on a fixed-price contract on another project. I find that neither of these incidents has been proved on the required standard of proof.
Management fee
140  As a final cost matter, there is an issue of whether a 12% management fee was agreed on. The defendants say it was left open-ended, to be determined by them at the end; the plaintiff says it was always agreed that the management fee would be 12%.
141  As background Mr. Garside testified that his fee for cost-plus contracts ranges from 10 to 15%, depending on the size of the contract. At times 100% of his work is done on this basis. As well, there is the previous cost-plus contract between the parties in March 2010 for work on the West Saanich Road property of the defendants. The invoice for that contract included a management fee of 15% and it was immediately paid. The defendants say that there was no discussion of a management fee for the contract after June 24, 2010; it simply appeared on the final invoice.
142  From the previous cost-plus contract I conclude that the defendants were familiar with the concept of a management fee in the context of a cost-plus contract. As well, Mr. Garside testified that he proposed waiving his management fee at the later meeting on December 4, 2010, as a way to resolve the issue of costs. However, that offer (which included a cost in excess of $165,000) was rejected by the defendants. Finally, there is nothing in Mr. Garside's day timer about any management fee. However, that is not determinative because some things of significance are not recorded there.
143  As in many issues in this litigation, it is one person's word against another.
144  I find that it is implausible that the plaintiff would forgo a management fee on a substantial project such as this. He has managed many cost-plus contracts in the past with success. He was clear in his evidence that he said a management fee would be applied. As well, the plaintiff charged and was paid a management fee on the first cost-plus contract in March 2010 for a contract amount substantially smaller than the amount at stake here. Assuming the defendants are correct that this fee was not discussed and simply turned up on the bill, it must have still been the expectation that another fee would be charged for a second cost-plus contract. It is similarly difficult on its face to accept that the plaintiff would simply leave it to the defendants to decide if there would be any management fee at all or, if so, the percentage.
145  It may have been that Mr. Garside said something to the effect that a management fee could be discussed later, but that is speculation and I am unable to find that he said or agreed that it could be waived. He did testify that he offered to forgo a fee on December 4, 2010, and this evidence is supported by the handwritten document of that date prepared by his bookkeeper. But this was rejected by the defendants because it was part of a proposal that they pay in excess of $185,000.
146  In light of these factors and the previous history of the parties with regards to a cost-plus contract and a management fee, I find that one was agreed on here. I find that a management fee of 12% is applicable.
Deficiencies
147  The defendants allege that the plaintiff's work was deficient with regards to quality of work and because some work was not completed at all. They go as far as to say that the cost of the deficiencies of the plaintiff's work cancel out any money they owe. I presume this submission includes unspecified damages they seek in negligence because the cost of all deficiencies claimed by the defendants does not offset the plaintiff's entire claim, even assuming the starting point for calculating that claim is $90,700.
148  It is generally accepted that there are always problems to fix after a project of this scale is completed, perhaps after any project. The plaintiff testified that he has always stood behind his work and his many years of running a successful construction business building and renovating custom homes generally supports that statement. His practice is to, for example, be available to customers for a period of time, sometimes up to ten years after the end of the project, to make good on any repairs. One of his subcontractors testified about this practice as well as Mr. Garside's firm expectation that a subcontractor address any problem within a day of being requested to do so.
149  Mr. Garside also testified that he generally takes responsibility for the damage done by subcontractors he has hired. An example of this was that he paid for refinishing the hardwood floor when it had been damaged by subcontractors. He went further and replaced boards that had been gouged by the defendants' use of unprotected chair legs. He was intending to repair a part of the exterior stucco that had been damaged by a subcontractor but the defendants asked him to leave their property before he could do so. He testified about other repairs he made at his cost.
150  In general Mr. Garside relies on more than 40 years' work doing custom homes and renovations, usually on a cost-plus basis, and he points out that he has never previously had to come to court to resolve a problem with a client.
151  There is written evidence of at least three trips by Mr. Garside to the Birch Road property to deal with deficiencies. His day timer for August 20, 2010, lists seven tasks such as grout around the fireplace and laundry, filler at the kitchen window and wood trim on the front door. Similarly, on August 30, 2010, there is a list of 22 items including new front door, skylights, towel bar, checking the fridge water, stair nosing and mirrors. And on November 10, 2010, a list of 13 items is recorded including window screens, countertop, dust at the top of the stairwell, repaint door sliders at pantry, replace a four way switch in the hallway and "sunscreen costs." I pause to note that a complaint such as dust in the stairway is very much in the de minimis category of deficiencies.
152  With respect to the list on November 20, 2010, Mr. Stirling testified that he gave Mr. Garside a list of deficiencies about that time. He believed Mr. Garside wrote them down and he may have written them in his day timer. Later in his evidence he was asked if the November 20, 2010, date recorded by Mr. Garside for a meeting to discuss deficiencies was accurate. Mr. Stirling replied that he was not sure the time recorded by Mr. Garside was correct but he did not dispute the date. I find that the day timer entry on November 20, 2010 is accurate.
153  From this evidence I conclude that there were discussions about deficiencies between the parties and deficiencies were addressed by the plaintiff up to at least November 20, 2010.
154  A further contextual matter relates to the meeting between the parties on December 4, 2010. This was not a pleasant event for anyone. The plaintiff presented a written note that said the defendants owed him in excess of $185,000, and the defendants were surprised and unhappy about this. Ms. Jones was offended by Mr. Garside's suggestion that the defendants pay what they could and then pay the balance in instalments although it is not clear she said that at the time. She testified that she thought she did not want to pay anything and I find that she said that to Mr. Garside. She abruptly left the meeting and went upstairs.
155  Mr. Stirling agreed that Ms. Jones asked Mr. Garside to leave the house and he showed him to the door. Mr. Stirling testified that the meeting was not "heated." I accept that no one was yelling but I also find it was very tense. He also testified that Mr. Garside said he thought the defendants would be good for the figure he presented and Mr. Garside also thought something could be negotiated. In his evidence Mr. Garside confirmed that the defendants refused to pay the invoice and that he was asked to leave.
156  Following the meeting of December 4, 2010, the parties had very little to do with each other. Mr. Garside testified that he attended at the Birch Road property to do some small jobs with the hope that the defendants would come around to pay their bill. Mr. Stirling testified that things remained amicable after the meeting, including Mr. Garside sending a small crew on or about December 17, 2010 to help install a new fridge that had been replaced on warranty after being requested to do so. The plaintiff was paid for this work by the supplier of the fridge.
157  In my view a fair reading of the December 4, 2010, meeting is that it was the end of any contractual relationship between the parties. Mr. Garside presented the plaintiff's account, the defendants refused to pay it, or any amount, and they asked Mr. Garside to leave. At that point all parties were left with the unpleasant options of changing their positions substantially or pursuing legal action. There was an attempt in February 2011 by Mr. Stirling to resolve the impasse for an amount of $110,000, but Mr. Garside declined to accept what he described in his evidence as about one half of what was owed.
158  The plaintiff urges me to find that he had no further contractual obligations with respect to work on the Birch Road property after December 4, 2010. Specifically, it is submitted that the defendants ended the contractual relationship with the plaintiff and he had no obligation to redress any deficiencies. I accept that the contract between the parties ended on December 4, 2010, and this was primarily as a result of the defendants refusing to pay anything to the plaintiff. I can see no other conclusion to be drawn from that situation other than that he defendants ended the contract.
159  However, I do not agree with the plaintiff that this finding ends any obligation he has to address legitimate deficiencies in his work. I therefore turn to consideration of the issue of specific deficiencies. As above, the context for these deficiencies is the cost-plus contracts from June 2010 to July 29, 2010, and then the one in dispute I have found above to be a cost-price contract with the quotation of a cost of $187,010 - $189,788.
160  The defendants have provided three letters from other contractors with respect to deficiencies and oral evidence from one of those contractors. In addition, Mr. Stirling testified about deficiencies and provided some photographs.
161  There is a letter dated September 20, 2012, from a supplier of furnaces and fireplaces to Mr. Stirling. It quotes a price of $2,150.40 (including HST) to supply and install sealing for a gas fireplace and a wood burning fireplace including fire stops. These fireplaces had been installed by subcontractors hired by the plaintiff. Among other things, the letter of September 20, 2012, describes the installation of an aftermarket fan in one of the fireplaces. According to the defendants this work and cost are a result of deficiencies in the work of the plaintiff.
162  The evidence is that the defendants picked out the fireplaces that were originally installed, but after installation they were not happy with the amount of heat from at least one of them. The fan installation referred to in the September 20, 2012, letter apparently addresses that concern. Colin Loganhume, the plaintiff's installer, testified that there was nothing in the September 20, 2012, letter that was part of his work or part of his discussions with the defendants. Further there were no complaints from the defendants until they asked Mr. Loganhume about in-line fans after the installation was done. With regards to fire stops, Mr. Stirling presented photographs of the fireplace chimneys, and there are no fire stops. However, the chimneys are contained in wooden towers framed on the outside of exterior walls. They were inspected and there is no requirement for fire stops in this situation; fire stops would be required if the chimneys were inside actual walls.
163  A further consideration is that the allegation that the plaintiff's subcontractor did not install fire stops for the fireplace chimneys was not put to that subcontractor when he gave evidence. I am entitled to consider this as a factor in assessing the credibility of the defendants' evidence (Gill Tech Framing Ltd. v. Gill,  at para. 29; citing Fast Trac Bobcat & Excavating Service v. Riverfront Corporate Centre Ltd,  at para. 9; and relying on the so-called rule in Browne v. Dunn (1893), 6 R. 67 (H.L)).
164  I conclude that the work described in the letter of September 20, 2012, did not result from deficient work by the plaintiff or his subcontractors. The defendants decided the addition of fans was necessary because the fireplaces they chose were not doing what they thought they should do. Fire stops were not required in this application.
165  A second letter provided by the defendants with regards to their allegation of deficiencies is dated May 7, 2012. It is from Dave Meade who operates KLAD Custom Building. Mr. Meade has been operating his own company doing custom home renovations for two years, and prior to that he was the general manager of a company that did similar work. He testified on behalf of the defendants.
166  The letter of May 7, 2012, refers to a quote for a, drywall, painting, exterior finishing and clean up. The total cost is $8,979.04 (including HST) and individual items are not costed. Mr. Meade testified that the work described in the letter was completed about this time and the defendants paid him this amount.
167  The letter of May 7, 2012 also included construction of a "pergola." However, as above, the notes taken by the defendants on July 29, 2010 refer to a "pagoda." I have not done an exhaustive review of the evidence but a review of my notes indicates that the parties referred to pagoda in their evidence. Counsel, after the trial and in response to a question from me, advised that pagoda and pergola were one and the same. Mr. Meade was not asked about this in his evidence because the use of pergola rather than pagoda did not come up then. It is not totally satisfactory but I presume that he meant pagoda when he said pergola. I will use the former word, pagoda.
168  With regards to the pagoda it was something talked about early on between the parties, the plaintiff gave an estimate for its construction and it was still being discussed in May 2010. There is reference to a pagoda on the handwritten list Mr. Stirling prepared at the meeting on July 29, 2010, with a cost of $3,000. Mr. Garside agreed in his evidence that the pagoda was something that was part of the original plan. It was not however built by the plaintiff, although anchor bolts for the structure were installed when concrete was poured. Mr. Garside testified that the defendants cancelled the pagoda; his "guess" was that they could not afford it. However, when he was asked in cross-examination whether he said to the defendants that he should get going on building the pagoda, he replied that he may have said that.
169  The cost of the pagoda is listed in the defendants' notes of July 29, 2010 as $3,000. However, since the context for the construction of the pagoda is a cost-plus contract, it is not open to the defendants to have it built at the cost of the plaintiff. That would mean they would get a pagoda at no cost. Therefore, the pagoda is not a deficiency and the cost must be deducted from the costs in the letter of May 7, 2012.
170  With regards to drywall and painting in the May 7, 2012, letter, much of this work was required because the defendants changed the skylights. But the work remained incomplete, and there was an obligation to complete the work as part of the quote given on July 29, 2010. It is a deficiency. Mr. Meade, the defendants' current contractor, testified that the ensuite bathroom paint was peeling and needed primer and new paint. I also accept that as a deficiency. The defendants would like painting under the stairs but that is a design choice; I deduct $200 for that item.
171  With regards to the reference to exterior caulking around patio doors in the letter of May 7, 2012, this strikes me as something that the plaintiff would have done as part of his regular and established practice of looking after the work he did. I conclude it was a deficiency in the work. Clean-up costs are not separated but they are, in general, reasonable.
172  The next record of deficiencies presented by the defendants is another letter From Mr. Meade, dated February 21, 2013. The specific work proposed in this quotation has not been done and it is (with costs before taxes in brackets): windows ($705), painting ($6,600), heated floor in bathroom ($5,000), exterior cantilever in master bedroom ($2,100), front door ($350), sealed unit above staircase ($1,520), exterior sliding doors ($3,840), skylight flashing ($720), flooring and vinyl decks ($2,820).
173  As a general comment on this list I note that it was made in February 2013, some two years after the plaintiff last worked on the defendants' Birch Road property. Undoubtedly, after this time routine maintenance and repairs are now required.
174  With regards to the specific items in Mr. Meade's letter of February 21, 2013:
Windows ($705)
175  Mr. Garside testified that he had done caulking around the windows in November or December 2010. Apparently this was not finished and I fix $500 for that task.
Painting ($6,600)
176  As Mr. Meade and Mr. Garside testified, nail pops are a common occurrence after construction is completed and the building settles. They are, therefore, a deficiency although not always one a builder has any control over. They are not in the lists recorded by Mr. Garside in his day timer in August and November 2010 but they may not have been apparent at that time. Some painting will be required after the nail pops are repaired. I see no basis for painting the entire interior of the house at the cost of the plaintiff two years after its work was completed. Painting for baseboards is dealt with in the discussion on floors. I fix the cost for repairing the nail pops, including paint, at $1,200.
Heated floor in en suite bathroom ($5,000)
177  The plaintiff installed in floor heating in the en suite bathroom with the standard spaces of 5" between the heat tubes. This leaves some areas between the tubes unheated, and Mr. Garside explained this to the defendants. There were no complaints from them after they moved into the Birch Road house, and this item is not on the August and November lists of deficiencies in the day timer of Mr. Garside.
178  Mr. Meade explained in his evidence that the defendants now want to replace the existing heated floor to install tubing 2-3" apart because there are unheated parts. This is a change of design and/or specifications. It is not a deficiency in the plaintiff's work.
Exterior cantilever in Master Bedroom ($2,100)
179  Mr. Meade testified that the master bedroom closet is cool and its floor is cantilevered over an outside area. He testified that his quotation is to remove the stucco "to try and discover where the draft is coming from." He did not know if there was insulation under the closet. The closet is not heated, Mr. Meade agreed that a closet should not be heated and he agreed that the insulation of the house was inspected.
180  I conclude that coolness in a closet that cannot be heated is not a deficiency. Further, the expense of $2,100 is not warranted to investigate a situation where insulation is the only remedy and it is at least probable that the floor is insulated.
Front door ($350)
181  There is some history to the front door, primarily of the defendants complaining about its finish. The plaintiff replaced it once to placate them. Mr. Meade testified that the finish remains "not to the satisfaction" of the defendants. He could not recall the exact condition of it. This is not a deficiency.
Sealed unit above staircase ($1,520)
182  The defendants seek the removal and installation of sealed units to access "compromised interior framing members" and to replace framing members as required. The framing was inspected, along with windows and insulation, and I conclude that any problem with the framing now, two years after the plaintiff left the job, is not a deficiency it is responsible for.
Exterior sliding doors ($3,840)
183  The defendants seek the replacement of 8 sliding doors and repair of the stucco around them based on the letter of February 21, 2013 from Mr. Meade. He testified that they do not open or close properly. Mr. Stirling testified about this as well. Mr. Garside testified that he has never had to replace a sliding door he has installed.
184  In his evidence Mr. Meade was not sure whether there were 8 or 4 sliding doors. He also acknowledged that he did not know what the problem was and that there could be a number of things wrong including not being installed correctly. The estimated cost for what are, frankly, vague complaints is high. I cannot agree that, if there is a deficiency, that the amount claimed is justified.
Sky light flashing ($720)
185  According to the letter of February 21, 2013, the sky lights need to be removed in order to "replace compromised framing members as required." Flashing is also to be supplied and installed. As above the framing was inspected more than two years previously.
186  Mr. Meade agreed the lack of flashing was a result of the defendants changing their mind about what kind of skylights, from closed to ones that open. This is an extra rather than a deficiency and not something the plaintiff should pay for.
Flooring ($25,880)
187  When the defendants purchased the Birch Road property it had hardwood floors that were water damaged. One of the first conversations between the parties was what to do with the flooring in the house and the original idea was to refinish the floors and replace any boards that required replacing. However at some point, Mr. Garside advised the defendants that the cost of a new floor was not much different than the cost of refinishing and repairing the old floor. As Mr. Stirling put it in his evidence, the decision to go with a new floor was an easy one to make.
188  The old floor was removed, stored and ultimately sold by the plaintiff for $1,000. This was given to the defendants, who in turn gave Mr. Garside's son and his wife $500 for helping with the sale.
189  When it came time to install the new floor the installer, Andrew Hill, tested the moisture level of the subfloor, as is normally done. The first level was higher than the accepted level and a decision was made to install dehumidifiers and put off the installation of the floors. A second moisture test had better results but the level was still not at the acceptable level. The problem with having high moisture levels in the subfloor is that there is a very good chance of the flooring that is installed over the subfloor will expand and then there will be cupping of each board. Everyone understood the problem and the risk.
190  At this point the versions of what happened differ substantially. Mr. Stirling testified that Mr. Hill said Mr. Garside told him to go ahead with the installation of the new floor and Mr. Garside would take the risk. On the other hand, Mr. Garside and Mr. Hill testified that Mr. Stirling said that he did not want to wait any longer and that the wood flooring should be installed even with the high levels of moisture in the subfloor. The floor was installed with the high moisture levels in the subfloor.
191  Mr. Hill testified that he was contacted by Mr. Stirling about a year after the floors were installed and he was told that they had started cupping. Mr. Stirling said he was not "mad or coming at me for it" (as Mr. Hill stated in his evidence), he was just looking for advice about what to do. Mr. Hill suggested further use of dehumidifiers, and he did not hear anything else until this litigation. In cross-examination Mr. Stirling confirmed this conversation with Mr. Hill.
192  There does not seem to be much doubt that the new flooring was installed over subflooring that had an unacceptable level of moisture. As everyone knew, the risk was that the floors would start cupping and that, in fact, happened. The question is who authorized the installation?
193  While this is primarily a conflict in evidence as between Mr. Garside and Mr. Stirling, there is also the evidence of Mr. Hill. He confirms that it was Mr. Stirling that authorized the installation of the new floors. It is true that Mr. Hill has a past and current working relationship with Mr. Garside. However there is also the telephone call from Mr. Stirling to Mr. Hill after the floors were installed and after the cupping was discovered. During that conversation Mr. Stirling did not suggest to Mr. Hill that there was a problem with who authorized the installation. It is possible that Mr. Stirling was looking for some free advice without engaging Mr. Hill in how the problem arose. Another explanation is that Mr. Stirling accepted that it was his problem.
194  Finally, the defendants' assertion that Mr. Hill told Mr. Stirling that Mr. Garside authorized the installation and took the risk was not put to Mr. Hill in cross-examination. I am entitled to consider this as a factor in assessing the credibility of the defendants' evidence (Gill Tech Framing Ltd. v. Gill,  at para. 29; citing Fast Trac Bobcat & Excavating Service v. Riverfront Corporate Centre Ltd,  at para. 9; and relying on the so-called rule in Browne v. Dunn (1893), 6 R. 67 (H.L)).
195  I find that it is probable that it was Mr. Stirling who authorized the installation of the wood floors over a subfloor that had higher than acceptable moisture levels. This is not a deficiency in the plaintiff's work, or the work of his subcontractor.
Vinyl Decks ($2,820)
196  The defendants seek the cost of removing and replacing the existing vinyl decking (and railings) from two decks at the Birch Road house. Mr. Meade testified that the decks do not drain and puddles gather in the wet weather. Further, puddles in the low spots remain for some time; they dry out after a period of time. There is no allegation the vinyl is leaking. Mr. Garside testified that it was installed with the seams overlapped as required by the manufacturer.
197  Mr. Garside testified that he frequently gets comments from customers such as the defendants in this case after vinyl decks are installed because of puddling. Drains are installed and some slope is put into the deck to prevent this. The slope can be increased but, if the slope is significant, then customers complain about that.
198  I accept the evidence of Mr. Garside that it is not possible to have a deck with a reasonable slope that is entirely free of puddling. Further, I interpret the defendants concern with the vinyl decks to be unrealistic given the construction of decks and the climate in which they live. And this matter was not raised by Mr. Stirling when deficiencies were discussed with Mr. Garside in August or November 2010. Perhaps it was dry in August but that cannot be said about November. I conclude that whatever problems the defendants perceive with the vinyl decks are not deficiencies.
Other issues
199  In his evidence Mr. Stirling reviewed a number of other matters he considered to be deficiencies in the work at the Birch Road house. For example, there was an issue of the placing of the stovetop and the placing of an island as part of the kitchen cabinets. There was considerable discussion about these matters and the cabinetmaker testified that he abandoned a bill of $4,000 rather than deal with the defendants any further. The kitchen cabinets were ordered and paid for directly by the defendants, rather than through the plaintiff, but the cabinetmaker's experience dealing with the defendants is consistent with the plaintiff's.
200  Another problem Mr. Stirling described was trying to move a high voltage wire in a wall that the plaintiff built. Apparently he attempted to do this himself and then sought the assistance of an electrician friend from work. They could not find the source of the wire. Drywall had to be cut and a new wire installed. The electrician did not testify. If there is a problem with this wire it has not been adequately explained. It is not a deficiency.
201  Mr. Stirling did raise an issue about the molding around some doors and some windows. He produced photographs to demonstrate that in some corners the molding was short, thus leaving a gap where weather could get to the window. I accept that these are deficiencies in the work managed by the plaintiff and I assess an amount of $500 to correct those deficiencies.
The plaintiff's claim
202  It follows from the above that the plaintiff is entitled to a claim for the cost of his materials and subcontractors, plus a management fee and taxes on that fee for the work at the Birch Road property. This follows from the cost-plus contract that was in place from June 24, 2010, to about December 4, 2010. Further, some of the costs of the plaintiff from before June 24, 2010, are legitimate to claim.
203  The plaintiff's claim at trial is in the amount of $206,627.32. This is the total of 108 invoices for materials and labour, from February 26, 2010, to December 30, 2010. There is no serious dispute that all of these costs were for the work on the Birch Road property. As Ms. Jones put it in her evidence, she did not think that Mr. Garside would bill anything that was not appropriate. The total claim includes a management fee of 12% which I have found applicable ($24,795.28) and taxes on that fee ($2,975.43). The overall total is $234,398.03.
204  The plaintiff's claim of $206,627.32 is more than the quote of $187,010 -$189,788 that Mr. Garside gave on July 29, 2010. The difference is about $19,000 or about 10%. A previous decision has concluded that leeway of 15% between an estimate and final payment price is acceptable (Mt. Cheam Developments Ltd. v. Clark et al, , 1988 CarswellBC 715 at paras. 11-12 (S.C.)).
205  None of these costs have been paid. As above, the defendants submit they owe nothing to the plaintiff. This is based on the defendants' view of the contract price of $90,700 minus the amount of deficiencies and work that should have been done. I have found against the defendants on that issue.
206  I have found the following deficiencies that are the responsibility of the plaintiff:
 Letter of May 7, 2012: $5,797.04 
 (drywall, painting,  
 exterior finish, clean  
 up; less pagoda and  
 paint under stairs)  
 Caulking around windows: $500.00 
 Repair of nail pops: $1,200.00 
 Repair of molding on windows: $500.00 
 Subtotal: $8,170.04 
 HST: $981.48 
 Total: $9,160.52 
207  I conclude that the evidence supports a net claim by the plaintiff in the amount of $225,237.48 ($234,398.03 less $9,160.52).
Negligence
208  In their counterclaim the defendants plead negligence on the part of the plaintiff. It is alleged that the plaintiff failed to properly manage the work at the defendants' Birch Road property and this failure resulted in damage and loss. It is also alleged that the work of the plaintiff was not completed in a professional and workmanlike manner.
209  There is not much doubt that the plaintiff owed the defendants a duty of care. The question is whether this duty was breached.
210  A significant part of the defendants' allegation of negligence relates to their assertion that the plaintiff did not keep proper accounts and did not submit a proper invoice until October 2011. The defendants rely on a 1947 decision from Ontario that a contractor in a cost-plus contract has an obligation to keep proper accounts (G.T. Parameter Construction Ltd. v. Sanders,  (H.C.J.); also Taylor v. Taylor, [1954] O.W.N. 575 (H.C.J.)). I am not persuaded that, as said in G.T. Parameter Construction Ltd. (para. 10), that a contractor under a cost-plus contract is in a favourable position because he has "no risk of any loss." The subject case is an example of just such a risk.
211  In any event, I accept that the plaintiff's records as they were presented to the defendants were not to a high standard. I say this by comparing the contract in dispute with the previous fixed-price contracts and the previous cost-plus contract which were characterized by very complete quotations and invoices. However, as discussed above, it cannot be said that the defendants were left in the dark for an extended period about the cost of the work that is now disputed. They knew from simple observation that the work was ongoing from the end of the last fixed-price contract in June 2010 and they knew, or should have known, that there would be costs for that work. They also knew at that time that Mr. Garside's estimate of $200,000 - $250,000 had been met and more was required to pay for the work.
212  More significantly, they knew on July 29, 2010, when Mr. Garside gave them a printout of the costs to date that they were in the order of $240,000. This was not what they owed because the print-out did not, for example, include invoices for work not yet received by the plaintiff. That number was not what they wanted to hear and, indeed, the evidence is that they did not read the print-out then or after the July 29, 2010, meeting. In the end the plaintiff submitted an invoice in October 2011 in an amount significantly higher than its previous numbers but that was the result of the discussions between the parties breaking down rather than poor record keeping.
213  There is no legal requirement for a contractor to provide record keeping to a high standard. I conclude that the plaintiff's records in this case were adequate (assuming that poor record keeping by a builder under a cost-plus contract amounts to negligence).
214  It is also alleged by the defendants that the plaintiff was negligent by failing to advise them of the impact of changes to designs of the work. To a large extent I conclude that the changes made in the work were at the direction of the defendants. They had in mind one project within one budget amount and, from a cost point of view, it was essentially complete by the end of the last fixed-price contract in June 2010 when the original estimate of $200,000 - $250,000 was met. The work carried on with their knowledge and they were never clear about what the budget was to be; on July 29, 2010, there was some clarity, but I have found above there was not the clarity the defendants wanted. By July 29, 2010, on the basis of their own incomplete numbers, the project had expanded substantially. I have addressed above the issue of the furnace which was moved and replaced as discussed with the defendants. Further, the defendants had unrealistic expectations that, for example, somehow the wiring of an older house could be reused in the newly renovated house.
215  The defendants also allege that the plaintiff did not obtain the best prices for the trades work for the project. The evidence for this allegation is thin and it is not particularized in argument. One aspect of it, perhaps, is that Mr. Garside's son was one of the labour contractors for the Birch Road property. Mr. Garside was questioned in cross-examination about whether this was good value and whether, in fact, his son was running the project rather than Mr. Garside. He denied this was the case, and there are only the defendant's suspicions that are contrary to this denial. In fact, the defendants rewarded Mr. Garside's son by paying he and his wife half of the money received from selling the old wood flooring.
216  As for damage to the project by other trades the evidence is that this was no more than would be expected and, in any case, the plaintiff took responsibility for it. Any issue with regards to deficiencies is addressed above. It is true that the plaintiff did not construct the pagoda but I have found above that was a deficiency rather than an issue of negligence. Finally, the complaints by Mr. Stirling in his evidence that Mr. Garside was sometimes not available because he was on holidays or working at other jobs does not by any means amount to negligence on his part.
217  I summary, I deny the defendant's counterclaim that the plaintiff was negligent when it managed the work on the Birch Road project.
Builders Lien
218  The defendants raise a timeliness issue with respect to the plaintiff's claim under the BLA. In summary, the defendants submit that the final day for filing a lien in this case was January 9, 2011, but the lien was filed on January 12, 2011. The plaintiff disagrees that his lien was filed late. As general context, the time limits for filing a lien under the BLA start when the project is substantially complete and they are strict. I note that Mr. Garside said in his evidence that the project was substantially complete on November 10, 2010, but he qualified that statement to say that on that date some things that were "not minor" were uncompleted.
219  I reproduce the applicable parts of the BLA as follows:
Definitions and interpretation
1 (1) In this Act:
. . .
For the purposes of this Act, a head contract, contract or subcontract is substantially performed if the work to be done under that contract is capable of completion or correction at a cost of not more than
3% of the first $500 000 of the contract price,
2% of the next $500 000 of the contract price, and
1% of the balance of the contract price.
For the purposes of this Act, an improvement is completed if the improvement or a substantial part of it is ready for use or is being used for the purpose intended.
. . .
Time for filing claim of lien
20 (1) If a certificate of completion has been issued with respect to a contract or subcontract, the claims of lien of
(a) the contractor or subcontractor, and
any persons engaged by or under the contractor or subcontractor
may be filed no later than 45 days after the date on which the certificate of completion was issued.
A claim of lien that is not governed by subsection (1) may be filed no later than 45 days after
the head contract has been completed, abandoned or terminated, if the owner engaged a head contractor, or
the improvement has been completed or abandoned, if paragraph (a) does not apply.
Subsection (1) does not operate to extend or renew the time for filing of a claim of lien if
that time would otherwise be determined with reference to the time an earlier certificate of completion was issued, or
time had started to run under subsection (2).
On the filing of a claim of lien under this Act, the registrar or gold commissioner has no duty to inquire as to whether or not the lien claimant has complied with the time limit for filing the claim of lien.
220  According to the defendants, $480,736.55 is the total contract price. This figure is taken from the plaintiff's invoice of October 12, 2011, with the addition of the five previous fixed-price contracts. Applying section 1(2) of the BLA, the defendants point out that the contract was substantially performed when 3% of the total contract price was capable of completion. This 3% amount is $14,422.09, using the defendants' estimate of the contract price.
221  According to the defendants, the billing of invoices from suppliers and subcontractors to the plaintiff is indicative of completion and more than 97% of the contract price was billed on or before November 23, 2010. That is, on or about November 23, 2010, there was substantial completion of the contract and the 45 day period for filing a lien commenced on that day. It expired on January 9, 2011, and, therefore, filing the lien on January 12, 2011, was late.
222  In my view, there are two errors in the defendant's calculation. The first relates to their setting the contract price at $480,736.55. That figure represents all of the previous fixed-price contracts as well as the plaintiff's invoice of October 12, 2011, in the amount of $238,627.55. It is relevant but not decisive that the plaintiff's claim in this litigation is for a lower amount, $234,398.03. Of more significance in my view is that the previous five fixed-price contracts are not appropriately included in the price of the contract at issue. The fixed-price contracts were complete to everyone's satisfaction and paid and the plaintiff does not seek a lien under those contracts and nor is one available.
223  I find that the appropriate contract price for the calculation of the time limit for filing the lien in this case is $234,398.03. The 3% amount is $7,031.94.
224  I also disagree with the defendant's use of the list of invoices submitted by the plaintiff as the best indication of the substantial completion. In my view, there is an alternate approach that more accurately reflects the completion of the improvement. The letter submitted by the defendants from KLAD Custom Building, dated May 7, 2012, lists deficiencies that were completed at or about that time. I have found above that, with some exceptions, the letter reflects legitimate deficiencies and the amount is $5,979.04. There are other amounts as described in the letter of February 13, 2013, from Mr. Meade that reflect work not yet done, totalling $9,160.52 for all deficiencies.
225  The result is that, as of February 13, 2013, more than 3% of the contract price was unpaid and under the BLA, the improvement was not substantially complete.
226  It follows that the filing of the lien on January 12, 2011 was not late.
Interest
227  The plaintiff seeks pre and post judgment interest pursuant to sections 1 and 8 of the Court Order Interest Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 79, at a rate of 6%. This is opposed by the defendants.
228  The plaintiff points out that the defendants have paid no money for the work done on their property since the last fixed-price contract in June 2010. Since that time, as is evident above, there have been costs in excess of $200,000 for the work. There is no evidence of any agreement between the parties as to the interest to be charged on overdue accounts and that is consistent with the informal nature of their contractual relations since June 2010.
229  Mr. Garside testified that he had to delay payments to his subcontractors using funds from other work. This was necessary in order to maintain the plaintiff's relationship with reliable subcontractors. Mr. Garside also testified that his working capital was reduced and he was forced to seek financing to keep his business going. His evidence is that the interest he paid for this financing was 6%. It is not clear that he had to finance the entire amount owing by the defendants.
230  As of July 1, 2013, the Registrar's rate under the Court Order Interest Act for pre-judgment interest is 1% and the post-judgment rate is 3%.
231  The plaintiff relies on two previous authorities for its submission that a higher rate than the Registrar's rates is appropriate in this case. In one judgment (Hardwoods Specialty Products LP v. Rite Style Manufacturing Ltd., ) the Court of Appeal said that the Registrar's rates of interest are only "rates of convenience to trial judges" and those rates should not be seen as the default rate (para. 17). In that case the court awarded interest at 5% per annum (having set aside the trial judge's decision to set interest at 24%). In the other case (Domtar Inc. v. Univar Canada Ltd., ) Madam Justice Fisher reviewed the Hardwoods decision and concluded that it is not necessary for a party to adduce specific evidence about the use to which a party would have put the money that is owed (para. 11). In the end she awarded the prime rate of interest.
232  A distinguishing feature of both of these judgments is that that they involved so-called commercial parties. In the subject case the plaintiff is a commercial party but the defendants are not. A factor that is at least as significant, and perhaps related, is that the judgments looked at the history of the parties relationships. In the case of Hardwoods there were previous contracts with express interest rates for overdue accounts. In Domtar there were past dealings to consider.
233  In the subject case there is no such history. Further, there is no documentary or any evidence of the plaintiff's practise with regards to overdue accounts with the defendants (or with anyone). For example, there is no reference on any of the previous contracts between these parties to an interest rate for overdue accounts. And another aspect of the lack of any written form of the contract in dispute between the parties is that there is no record of any interest rate for overdue accounts. I accept that this is likely a result of the informal nature of the way the plaintiff has conducted his successful business over the years. The practise has apparently served him well, but it is a problem when there is a dispute over a contract.
234  In these circumstances pre-judgment interest is payable in this case at the Registrar's rate. I also order post-judgment interest in this case at the Registrar's rate.
Summary
235  I make the following Orders and directions:
An Order that the plaintiff is forthwith entitled to a builders lien (the Lien) pursuant to the Builders Lien Act in the amount of <damage type = "other">$223,178.99</damage> against the lands and premises owned by the defendants, legally described as:
PID 000-147-338
Block 39, Section 19, Range 2 West
North Saanich District Plan 1211
An Order that the Lien has priority as against the lands and premises and all rights, titles and interests of the defendants;
An Order that the defendants pay to the plaintiff the amount of <damage type = "total">$223,178.99</damage>;
An Order that the defendants pay to the plaintiff pre-judgment and post-judgment interest pursuant to the Registrar's rates and the Court Order Interest Act;
The plaintiff's application for an Order for sale of the subject property in default of payment is adjourned and will be heard at 9:00 AM on August 23, 2013, by telephone hearing, unless adjourned generally or otherwise by agreement; and
The plaintiff is entitled to regular costs, subject to any application made within 45 days of this judgment (or appeal decision).

Action by the plaintiff for damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. In March 2001, the plaintiff was sitting in the front passenger seat of a small cargo van when an oncoming vehicle, operated by the defendant, crossed the centre line and stuck the vehicle, causing it to collide with a utility pole. The plaintiff's head hit the passenger window when the van struck the utility pole and she lost consciousness. She was treated at hospital and released later the same day. After the accident, the plaintiff suffered pain in her head, right side, shoulder and back and experienced dizziness, nausea, tinnitus and frequent headaches. In addition, an MRI undertaken in December 2007 indicated a large number of lesions in the plaintiff's brain. Prior to the accident, the plaintiff had no injuries or health problems of any material nature. She assisted her husband in a building maintenance and janitorial business and later in the operation of a grocery store business. She also had an active social life which included dancing and socializing with friends. Following the accident, the plaintiff remained at home for two to four weeks, although she occasionally went to the grocery store owned by her and her husband to assist with training of staff that had been hired to assist in her absence. After four weeks the plaintiff returned to the grocery store were she continued her duties as cashier, but was unable to stock shelves or lift heavy items. She also experienced difficulty in remembering the prices of items and had to take numerous breaks throughout the day. She also became very irritable, impatient and grouchy. Shortly after the accident, the plaintiff learned that her husband suffered from a serious heart problem. In November 2001, the plaintiff became pregnant. She developed serious complications during her pregnancy including pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and hypertension and at 33 weeks she delivered a still-born child by caesarean section. Following the loss of her baby, the plaintiff was diagnosed with a serious depressive condition and, although she improved somewhat, she continued to suffer from significant depressive symptoms. After the plaintiff's grocery store business failed, she opened an organic meat and produced store which also failed and then took employment at a grocery store. Because of her husband's ill health, she increased her hours at the grocery store, but was unsure how long she could continue to work increased hours due to pain in her neck, shoulder and back and her difficulty in coping with some of the demands made on her by customers. 

HELD: Action allowed.
 The plaintiff suffered a mild traumatic brain injury as a result of the accident, which was a cause of the cognitive problems experienced by her following the accident. The plaintiff's depression was caused by a combination of the motor vehicle accident and the injuries suffered by her, the loss of her child and learning that her husband suffered from a life threatening heart condition. The depression was an indivisible injury and the injuries suffered in the motor vehicle accident were a necessary contributing cause of the depression. The change of any significant improvement in the plaintiff's condition was remote. Although the accident was a necessary cause of the plaintiff's depression, there was a realistic chance that the plaintiff would have suffered a major depression in any event. Taking into account the impact of the plaintiff's injuries on her life and the realistic chance that the plaintiff would have suffered depression in any event, appropriate award was <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$125,000</damage> for non-pecuniary damages, <damage type = "past wage loss">$60,000</damage> for loss of past earning capacity, <damage type = "future wage loss">$300,000</damage> for loss of future earning capacity, <damage type = "future care">$50,000</damage> for cost of future care and loss of homemaking capacity and <damage type = "special">$1,234</damage> for special damages.

1   When sorrows come, they come not single spies but in battalions. Hamlet, Act IV, Scene V
On March 4, 2001, the plaintiff, Candy Hong Zhang ("Ms. Zhang"), was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Burnaby, British Columbia. In the eight years following that accident she has suffered more misfortune than many people do in a lifetime. My task is to determine what part of Ms. Zhang's afflictions have been caused the injuries she suffered in that accident and what part have been caused by events for which the defendants are not responsible. The defendants have admitted that they are wholly at fault for the accident and the injuries which Ms. Zhang suffered in the accident. They say, however, that the major portion of the loss and damage that Ms. Zhang has suffered was not the result of their negligence.
2  Ms. Zhang was born in Shanghai, China, in 1964. She immigrated to Canada in 1991 to join her husband, Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang met while they were students in Shanghai. Mr. Chen was a supporter of the student protest movement in China in 1989. He came to Canada as a political refugee and Ms. Zhang joined him as soon as she was able to do so.
3  In this case Ms. Zhang claims that the motor vehicle accident and the injuries she suffered as a result of that accident have had a devastating effect on her life. It is therefore necessary to consider the evidence of Ms. Zhang's physical and cognitive capabilities prior to the accident. Before doing so, however, I must address the question of Ms. Zhang's credibility.
4  I have one task in common with that of each of the doctors who have given evidence before me. That is, I must assess the credibility and reliability of the evidence of Ms. Zhang and Mr. Chen. That is so because my assessment of Ms. Zhang's condition must be based primarily on the evidence of her and her husband.
5  After hearing lengthy evidence from both Ms. Zhang and Mr. Chen, I have concluded that the evidence which they gave before me is credible and reliable. I did not detect any material degree of exaggeration or over-statement in their evidence. My impression of both of them is that they were doing their best to relate their evidence in an honest and straightforward way.
6  Ms. Zhang was cross examined in particular with respect to two matters touching on her credibility. The first concerned certain statements which she made on her application for employment with Safeway in 2006. Ms. Zhang admitted in cross examination that she had misrepresented her medical condition on her application forms. Specifically, she stated on those forms that she was not a person with a disability, that is, that she had no impairment which would have disadvantaged her in her in her employment or which would cause an employer to consider her to be disadvantaged in her employment. In another form provided to Safeway, Ms. Zhang answered no to the following questions:
Do you have any illness, disability or physical limitation which could prevent you from regularly lifting or carrying 9 kilograms.
Do you have any illness, disability or physical limitation which could impede your performance in the position you are applying for.
Do you have any illness, disability or physical limitation which could prevent you from doing work of a repetitive nature.
7  Ms. Zhang admitted that she had lied in answer to the first question above. With respect to the last three questions she admitted that she had failed to disclose her condition to Safeway. Her explanation for so doing was that she had previously disclosed her condition to Safeway in a job fare at Oakridge and had been told she was not being offered a job. She testified that she was sure she could not get the job with Safeway if she disclosed her condition on this application.
8  While I in no way condone this conduct by Ms. Zhang, it does not persuade me that I cannot rely on the evidence she has given before me. She frankly admitted the misstatement on the application forms. At the time of the application Ms. Zhang was desperate to find suitable employment. In fact she has carried out her duties at Safeway without accommodation. I do not think I can conclude that her credibility before me has been impugned to the extent that I should not accept her evidence because of the answers she gave on the employment application forms.
9  Ms. Zhang was also extensively cross examined as to whether she had tape recorded her interview with Dr. Derryck Smith in an independent medical examination arranged by the defendants. She stated that she could not recall. While that is not something that one should forget, I have concluded that was an honest answer. The tape recording in question was done at the request of her counsel. It should be noted that the tape recording was made before the Court of Appeal decided that it was improper to do so. The existence of the tape recording was disclosed on the plaintiff's list of documents. My impression of her evidence on this point is that she was having difficulty in recalling the circumstances of her interview with Dr. Smith, which took place in September 2005. Ms. Zhang has seen many doctors in the past 4 to 5 years in connection with her injuries. In her evidence she acknowledged that she had met with a doctor at ICBC's request but could specifically recall Dr. Smith. My recollection is that the questions put to her were specific to taping the interview with Dr. Smith. While I have some reservations about her evidence in this regard I do not think that it should lead me to question her evidence in general. I accept that she genuinely could not recall making the tape recording at Dr. Smith's office. It is clear that no effort was made to hide the existence of the tape recording and I do not think that Ms. Zhang would have deliberately misstated her recollection in this regard.
10  Ms. Zhang and Mr. Chen met when they were both members of a student association in Shanghai in the late 1980s. Both Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang state that Ms. Zhang was a very good student and the recipient of a number of scholarships in China. She was also appointed to the executive of the Shanghai Students' Association. Both Ms. Zhang and Mr. Chen testified that this appointment was an indication that Ms. Zhang was highly regarded by the officials in charge of the educational system in Shanghai. Ms. Zhang completed a course in financial accounting and was hired to work for what she describes as the China Bank, in 1987. Mr. Chen also worked briefly for the Bank of China as a financial specialist. While in China, both Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang studied English as a second language. Ms. Zhang's plan was to improve her English language skills to the point where she could hope to obtain employment with one of the foreign banks, which were at that time being allowed to establish offices in Shanghai.
11  The couple married in October of 1989. Their lives and the lives of many others were changed dramatically by the events in China in the late 1980s. Mr. Chen became involved in assisting with the financing of the students protest movement, which culminated in the Tiananmen Square incident. In October 1989, he was forced to leave China and come to Canada as a political refugee. As soon as he was able, he sponsored Ms. Zhang to come to Canada and she immigrated and arrived here in December of 1991.
12  When Mr. Chen first came to Canada, he worked as an assistant cook and as a janitor and building maintenance person. Ms. Zhang assisted Mr. Chen with his building maintenance and janitorial business when she joined him. They were responsible for the cleaning of a 7-storey office building. Both Ms. Zhang and Mr. Chen worked full weekly shifts as janitorial workers between 5:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. The evidence of both, which I accept, is that Ms. Zhang was physically capable of working full time as a janitor cleaning this office building.
13  The couple's long-term plan was to establish a business of their own. In 1996, they opened the D-Top Food Market in Burnaby. This was a grocery store of approximately 5,000 square feet. Mr. Chen was the sole shareholder of the company that owned the D-Top Food Market, but both Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang devoted their full time and attention to the business from the time it opened until the time of the accident.
14  Mr. Chen states that business increased steadily between 1996 and 2001. While this appears to be true, the financial statements provided to me also indicated that the business was not profitable. Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang were able to sustain themselves from the income of the business. However, they were able to do so only by working long hours, seven days a week, at the market.
15  Notwithstanding these long working hours, both Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang state that they had an active and happy social life up to the time of the accident. They state that they enjoyed going to movies together and ballroom dancing. Ms. Zhang particularly enjoyed socializing with friends, although Mr. Chen was not so enthusiastic about this activity. Mr. Chen also testified that the couple enjoyed happy and fulfilling marital relations.
16  The couple divided their duties at the D-Top Market. Ms. Zhang primarily worked as a cashier, but she also stocked shelves and helped with the cleaning. Mr. Chen worked at the back of the store. They usually went to work together in the morning. Typically they would arrive at the store between 9:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. The store hours were 9:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. After the store closed, the couple would clean up and usually leave between 8:30 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
17  The couple did employ casual, part-time help to assist them up to the time of the accident. Mr. Chen described this help as neighbourhood women who were looking for some part-time work during the day. The part-time employees were principally employed stocking shelves. Ms. Zhang's time was principally taken up as a cashier.
18  Both Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang testified that Ms. Zhang was popular with her customers and that she was friendly and approachable to them. While working at the store, Ms. Zhang communicated with her customers primarily in English. She also was able to learn and use a few sentences of Japanese and Vietnamese to assist in dealing with those customers who spoke those languages. She also, of course, communicated with Mandarin speakers in Mandarin if they wished.
19  Prior to the accident, both Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang testified that Ms. Zhang had no injuries or health problems of any material nature. They both describe Ms. Zhang as having a happy, outgoing and friendly disposition.
20  The accident in this case occurred on March 4, 2001. Mr. Chen was driving a small cargo van, which was loaded with supplies for the D-Top Market. Ms. Zhang was sitting in the front passenger seat. The undisputed evidence is that she was wearing a shoulder belt and that the head rest in the vehicle was properly adjusted. Shortly before 9:00 a.m., Mr. Chen was driving east along Imperial Street in Burnaby, near McKay. An oncoming car, operated by the defendant, crossed the centre line and struck Mr. Chen's van on the left side just behind the driver's door. Either the impact of the collision or the momentum of the defendants' vehicle then drove the van to the right where it collided with a utility pole just behind the passenger's door. Both vehicles were extensively damaged. Both Mr. Chen and Ms. Zhang report that they loss consciousness briefly. Mr. Chen states that he was awakened by passersby knocking on the window of the van.
21  Mr. Chen testified that he felt two impacts in the accident. He states that he could hear his wife's head hit the right window and bounce back when the van hit the utility pole. He says that he lost consciousness briefly, and woke up and saw that his wife's eyes were closed. He has no idea how long he was unconscious but he can state definitely that his wife was not moving or responsive when he regained his senses. Mr. Chen said that the police and ambulance attendants arrived at the scene soon after the accident. Immediately before that passersby knocked on the window of the van but his wife did not respond. He says that he revived his wife by shaking and speaking to her after which other people arrived to help. Ms. Zhang recalls hitting her head on the side window of the van. She reports that she lost consciousness.
22  On the basis of the above evidence I conclude that Ms. Zhang did strike her head and did lose consciousness briefly in the course of the accident. These findings will be of importance in assessing the nature and extent of her injuries.
23  The couple were taken to Royal Columbia Hospital by ambulance and treated at the emergency ward there. They were released later in the day and driven home by a friend. Mr. Chen returned to work that day, but Ms. Zhang remained at home to rest.
24  After the accident Ms. Zhang suffered a number of symptoms. While she was at the hospital Ms. Zhang reported that she felt lots of pain in her head. She recalls feeling very dizzy and feeling like everything around her in the room was moving. She remembers having a cut on her lip and when she was able to look in the mirror noticing that her face was red and swollen on the right side as was her neck.
25  Ms. Zhang went to see Dr. Lee, her family physician, the next day as she was continuing to feel pain on her right side, experience dizziness and have pain in her shoulder.
26  In the two to four weeks immediately following her accident, she rested at home although she occasionally did go back to the D-Top Market to help train workers who had been hired to help out in her absence. The D-Top Market had two rooms at the back of the store where she was able to sit and lie down if she felt it was necessary to do so. In the period of time after the accident and before the D-Top Market closed Ms. Zhang said she had to take frequent rest breaks after she returned to work.
27  Ms. Zhang described her symptoms after the accident in more detail. She says that she felt like her neck was being squeezed hard causing her pain which stayed all the time. She described her back as feeling like a large piece of stone had been placed on it and says that she felt heavy throughout her whole body and had soreness throughout her entire back. Shortly after the accident she began to notice and feel pain in the area of her tailbone which did not go away.
28  Ms. Zhang also reported that she suffered from frequent headaches in the period after the accident, those headaches being principally on the right side of her head. She reports that she often felt as though the floor on which was standing or walking was on a slope. Within a few days of the accident she began to experience dizziness and nausea although she cannot recall whether she did in fact vomit. She reported tinnitus in her ear for the first time shortly after the accident. The episodes of tinnitus lasted a few minutes each. She also reported that she was no longer able to tolerate loud noises or even noises which other people would not characterize as being unduly loud. Generally she felt tired and lethargic.
29  As indicated above, Ms. Zhang returned to work at the D-Top Market approximately four weeks after the accident. She returned to her duties as a cashier but she was not able to stock goods on the shelves or lift the cases that she formally could. When she returned to work she noticed that she had trouble remembering prices of goods in the store. The D-Top Market did not have scanning equipment and the cashiers therefore had to remember the price of most goods. She says that she found it very difficult to memorize the new produce prices each day and would make mistakes that she never made before the accident. Ms. Zhang says that she averaged eight to nine breaks a day, and that when she took a break and rested she noticed a lessening of the pain in her back, shoulders and neck.
30  Ms. Zhang also reports that after the accident, as she put it, she lost motivation. Whereas before she had been gregarious and outgoing with the store's customers, she now found that talking to customers was a burden to her. She became very anxious about the financial security of the family.
31  To compound Ms. Zhang's anxiety and apprehension she learned shortly after the accident that her husband, Mr. Chen, had been diagnosed with a serious heart problem. This made her more anxious. The symptoms and work pattern I have described above did not materially change throughout the time that the D-Top Market remained in operation after the accident. It closed in February 2003 when its lease expired.
32  Significantly, Ms. Zhang also reports that after the accident she would become very impatient and irritable even when faced with a small problem. She says that she would become very grouchy with her husband. These behaviours were in marked contrast to those before the accident in which she reported herself as being friendly and outgoing and having very few arguments or difficulties with her husband.
33  In November 2001 Ms. Zhang became pregnant. She testified that she had made up her mind to have a baby for her husband. By this I took her to mean that she wished to make sure that she and her husband had children and, in particular, her husband would have children given the fragile state of his health.
34  Her symptoms had not materially improved before Ms. Zhang became pregnant. While she was pregnant she reported that the symptoms continued and that the pain in her tailbone got worse. Notwithstanding these complaints and her pregnancy she continued to work as a cashier at the D-Top store. She reports that at that time standing and working at the cash register would cause pain in the mid to lower back region. She also reports that she was unable to sit comfortably.
35  Tragically, Ms. Zhang developed very serious complications during her pregnancy. She developed pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and hypertension. In June she was hospitalized. She delivered a still-born boy by caesarean section at 33 weeks gestation.
36  To compound the family's difficulties business at the D-top Market continued to deteriorate. Mr. Chen testified that up to the time of the accident the volume of business at the market increased by approximately 5% per year. However, the financial statements produced for the market business show that the market never made a profit, although its losses did increase after the accident.
37  Things did not improve for Ms. Zhang after the loss of her baby. Her husband's medical condition remained fragile. In January 2003 she was diagnosed with a serious depressive condition. She had "ideation" about suicide and homicide. Her psychiatrist, Dr. To, recommended that she be hospitalized. However, Mr. Chen was opposed to her being hospitalized. After consulting with Dr. To, Ms. Zhang was treated with medication, but not hospitalized. I find that this depression slowly improved beginning in early 2003. However, Ms. Zhang continues to suffer from significant depressive symptoms.
38  After the D-Top Market closed, Ms. Zhang opened an organic meat and produce store on Oak Street in Vancouver. That business, in which she was assisted by her husband, did not prosper. I was shown no financial statements for the business but I understand it was closed when the landlord retook possession of the premises in September 2003. In 2003, Mr. Chen obtained employment with a courier company. He was working in the dispatch centre at the airport in Richmond for that company in January 2007 when he became ill and had to be taken to the emergency ward at the Richmond General Hospital. His illness, which was related to his heart condition, resulted in Mr. Chen being placed on long-term disability with a significant decrease in his income. As a result, Ms. Zhang felt that it was necessary for her to increase her hours at Safeway.
39  Ms. Zhang underwent a lengthy period of counselling. In 2006 she commenced work with Canada Safeway, initially on a part-time basis. After her husband could no longer work, she increased her hours and, since 2007, has worked approximately 32 to 40 hours per week in the delicatessen department in the Safeway outlet located on Davie Street near English Bay. This apparently is one of the two busiest Safeway stores in British Columbia. Ms. Zhang has been able to perform her duties as a delicatessen clerk throughout her period of employment. She has received consistently good reviews from her employer and has, in fact, been recognized on a number of occasions with employee service awards called World Class Service Awards.
40  Ms. Zhang testified that although she is able to work 32 to 40 hours a week at Safeway at present, she does not know how long she can continue to do so. She complains of neck, shoulder and back pain, which complaints are aggravated while working the shift at Safeway. In addition, she finds it difficult to cope with some of the demands made on her by customers, particularly customers who ask her to undertake more than one task at a time. For example she related an incident in which she became frustrated with a customer who asked her for several items in succession. She reports that at the end of a shift at Safeway she is completely exhausted and can do nothing other than rest when she gets home.
41  I think it is fair to say that Ms. Zhang's complaints can be grouped into three basic categories:
pain and physical discomfort;
impairment of cognitive abilities and functions; and
deterioration of mood and enjoyment of life.
42  Ms. Zhang's position is that these symptoms have significantly impaired her ability to work and have virtually ended her social and recreational activities. I do not understand the defendants to dispute that Ms. Zhang's reported symptoms are genuine. From the defendants' perspective the fundamental issues are the cause of those symptoms and the extent to which they have caused any loss of income or loss of income earning capacity.
43  The defendants' position is that Ms. Zhang's current difficulties are primarily caused by complications from her pregnancy and loss of her child in 2002. The defendants submit that the complications included pre-eclampsia and hypertension, followed by severe post-partum depression. They say that these events were in no way caused by their tortious conduct and are therefore not compensable. In particular, the defendants strongly argued that the depression was caused by the loss of Ms. Zhang's child and not by the accident.
44  I must determine the cause of Ms. Zhang's difficulties. To do so I must review the extensive medical evidence presented at trial.
45  I heard evidence from the following doctors on behalf of the plaintiff; Dr. Raymond Ancill, a psychiatrist; Dr. John Du, a registered psychologist; Dr. Shao-Hua Lu, a psychiatrist; Dr. Anthony Salvian, a specialist in vascular surgery; Dr. Ronda Shuckett, a specialist in internal medicine and rheumatology; Dr. Gary Stimac, diagnostic radiologist with particular expertise in neuroradiology; Dr. Andrew Travlos, a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist; Dr. Gordon Wallace, registered psychologist with a concentration on rehabilitation medicine. In addition the plaintiff filed a report of Dr. Donald Cameron, a neurologist, whom the defendants did not seek to cross-examine.
46  For the defendants, I heard evidence from the following experts; Dr. Jocelyne LaPointe, a diagnostic neuroradiologist; Dr. Derryck Smith, a psychiatrist; Dr. Bernard Tessler, a neurologist; Dr. William Yu, an orthopaedic surgeon.
47  Mr. Russell McNeil, an occupational therapist, provided a report and gave evidence with respect to cost of future care to allow Ms. Zhang to maintain a quality of life as close as practical to that she possessed prior to the accident. In addition, Mr. William Struthers, a labour economist, provided actuarial evidence with respect with respect to certain issues of future care and with respect to the income that persons with certain characteristics might expect to earn over their working lives.
48  I do not intend to review each of the expert opinions in any detail. While I have read and considered them all I will make specific reference to them only when I consider it necessary to explain or define the conclusions I have reached on the many issues before me.
49  I will first deal with the issues which arise from the wide divergence in the medical opinions presented in this case.
50  There was a disagreement on the question of whether Ms Zhang suffered a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in the motor vehicle accident. This disagreement may be further broken down into a number of disputes. The first relates to what happened in the accident and in particular as to whether Ms. Zhang lost consciousness. As I have already stated I find as a fact that Ms Zhang did suffer a brief loss of consciousness in the accident. In reaching this conclusion I place primary reliance on the evidence of Mr. Chen that he observed that his wife's eyes were closed and that she was non-responsive immediately after the accident. In addition it is clear that Ms. Zhang did strike her head against the passenger door window. I am aware that Ms. Zhang scored 15 out of 15 on the Glasgow Comma Scale when it was administered by the ambulance attendants. However it is unclear on the evidence when the test was actually administered. It appears that it was administered sometime after she was removed from the vehicle, probably in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. By that time she had regained consciousness.
51  In addition to what happened during the accident I accept that Ms. Zhang did experience a number of symptoms which were consistent with her having suffered a concussion. In the period after the accident she experienced nausea, dizziness and vertigo. Perhaps most significantly, she reported significant memory impairment and word finding difficulties after the accident and before her pregnancy. I do not consider that the difficulties experienced by Ms. Zhang in remembering prices of goods that she had been pricing for years previously to be trivial or minor.
52  Dr. Cameron was of the opinion that Ms. Zhang did suffer a MTBI in the accident. He based this opinion in part on his conclusion that she did experience a brief period of altered consciousness after the accident.
53  Dr. Tessler was somewhat dismissive of Ms. Zhang's symptoms after the accident. He described them as being the "mildest of the mild". I found this comment, as well as certain remarks he made during his evidence, as being indicative of an attitude on his part that Ms. Zhang's complaints should not be taken too seriously. I was particularly troubled by a comment made by Dr. Tessler in cross examination to the effect that Ms. Zhang's symptoms may settle after litigation. Apart from the fact that Dr. Tessler was not qualified as an expert in psychiatry or psychology, the comment was gratuitous. On the whole I formed the impression was Dr. Tessler was straying into the area of advocating for the defence point of view in his evidence. I do not think he was doing so deliberately but he did seem to show a lack of balance and perspective in his evidence.
54  This brings me to a consideration of the area of greatest controversy between the doctors. In December 2007, Ms. Zhang underwent an MRI scan of her brain. It is agreed by all doctors that the MRI disclosed an unusually large number of lesions. In Dr. Stimac's opinion there were approximately 70 lesions. In Dr. Lapointe's opinion there were between 27 and 33, depending on the imagining plane. Both doctors agree that these lesions are the result of some insult to the brain. There, however, the agreement ends. Dr. Stimac is emphatically of the opinion that these lesions were caused by the trauma of the accident. Dr. Lapointe is emphatically of the opinion that they were not.
55  Dr. Stimac's opinion is based on the number of lesions, the fact that in his opinion they were generally proximate to the cerebral cortex, that is subcortical or juxtacortical, and the fact that they were in the frontal regions of the brain. In his opinion the lesions are typical for traumatic shear injury, that is injury caused by the brain colliding with the skull as a result of the forces exerted in the accident. Dr. Stimac was also of the opinion that the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles in Ms. Zhang's brain were dilated. In his opinion this dilation was indicative of atrophy of the brain. According to Dr. Stimac such atrophy is commonly seen as a sequel to a closed head injury and correlates with short term memory dysfunction.
56  Dr. Lapointe unequivocally rejects the opinion that the lesions are associated with trauma from the accident. She found no abnormality in the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles. Contrary to what Dr. Stimac observed, he concluded that the majority of the lesions were in the white matter of the brain and not subcortical. In her written report Dr. Lapointe attributed the presence of the lesions to the pre eclampsia and hypertension suffered by Ms. Zhang in her pregnancy. In her oral testimony she clarified her report by stating that the lesions were indicative of hypertension and that the extensive references to eclampsia and pre eclampsia in her report were intended to be background information helping to explain how the hypertension originated. Although she did not state this in her written opinion, I got the impression from her testimony that Dr. Lapointe could not reconcile the number of lesions present with what she concluded were only very mild symptoms of brain trauma following the accident.
57  I have concluded that Ms. Zhang did in fact suffer a MTBI in the accident. While I am of the view that Dr. Stimac somewhat overstated the indications of MTBI, I equally think that Dr. Lapointe was too dismissive of the idea. On cross examination she affirmed that in her view the most likely cause of the lesions was hypertension. However it was clear to me that the mechanism whereby hypertension can cause injury to the brain requires not only a tendency to high blood pressure but also actual elevated blood pressure. Apart from readings taken during the currency of the pre eclampsia, there is no evidence that Ms. Zhang's actual blood pressure reached levels which would cause the cerebral infarctions referred to in Dr. Lapointe's report as a cause of the lesions. It is true that Dr. Wong doubled the dosage of anti hypertensive medication for Ms. Zhang in April 2007, but that was because of an increase in diastolic pressure.
58  I also find that the MTBI was a cause of the cognitive problems experienced by Ms. Zhang following the accident. In reaching that conclusion I accept that Ms. Zhang did in fact experience a decline in her cognitive functioning after the accident. In this regard I prefer the evidence of Dr. Du to that of Dr. Smith. In my view Dr. Du was better able to evaluate Ms. Zhang's cognitive abilities because he was able to communicate with her in Mandarin, the only language in which she is fluent. Dr. Du was also able to evaluate the significance of Ms. Zhang's academic achievements in China prior to coming to Canada. I accept Dr. Du's conclusion that Ms. Zhang's pre morbid intelligence was in the high average to superior range. To my mind this opinion is reinforced by comparing Ms. Zhang's performance at the D-Top market before and after the accident. I find that prior to the accident Ms. Zhang was an extremely competent and effective person. On the other hand after the accident she was really not able to cope with the demands put on her at the D-Top market, particularly in the areas of memory.
59  While Dr. Smith was unimpressed with Dr. Du's opinion he appeared to have made little effort to investigate this question himself. I heard no evidence to call into question the basis on which Dr. Du made his comparative intelligence evaluation.
60  Dr. Ancill was also of the opinion that Ms. Zhang current difficulties are caused by chronic pain and MTBI. In his opinion the level of any continuing mood disorder is insufficient to account for her ongoing functional impairment.
61  In summary I find that Ms. Zhang did experience a decline in her cognitive abilities after the accident. I have already found that this decline was due in part to the MTBI. I now turn to a consideration of the extent to which depression contribute to these difficulties and to the etiology of that depression.
62  It is common ground that Ms. Zhang suffered a major depressive episode in late 2002 after the loss of her foetus at 33 weeks gestation. There is also general agreement that she experienced some depressive symptoms throughout most of the period between the accident and the trial of this action. The question I must address is the role that the injuries she suffered in the accident played in that depression.
63  Dr. Du is of the opinion that Ms. Zhang was suffering from adjustment disorder with depression prior to the major depression she experienced after the loss of her foetus. His evidence was that the adjustment disorder with depression was a significant risk factor with respect to the major depression Dr. To diagnosed in January 2003. Dr. Ancill was of the opinion that Ms. Zhang suffered from a MTBI, which also is associated with a significantly greater vulnerability to depression and anxiety. He did not specifically agree that Ms. Zhang was suffering from adjustment disorder, but he clearly was of the view that her MTBI and chronic pain significantly increased the risk of her suffering a major depression.
64  Dr. Smith disagreed with the opinion that the accident played any direct role in the major depression suffered by Ms. Zhang. In his opinion the major depression was caused by the loss of Ms. Zhang's child and the depressive disorder she developed was in no way directly related to the accident. This opinion was based in part on his conclusion that Ms. Zhang had no psychiatric symptoms prior to the pregnancy. When pressed for the basis for this conclusion, Dr. Smith based it almost entirely what he described as a statement in Dr. To's clinical records that Ms. Zhang was well psychiatrically until June 2002. I observe that the note from Dr. To, which was made in January 2003, says simply that Ms. Zhang had said she was fine until June 2002 when she lost her pregnancy. To my mind it is important to note that Dr. To's note does not state that Ms. Zhang was well psychiatrically until June 2002. It, in fact, relates a statement that Ms. Zhang made to her. Ms. Zhang was not cross-examined about that alleged statement.
65  Dr. Smith agreed in cross examination that, based on this note, he had concluded prior to his examination of Ms. Zhang that she had no psychiatric issues prior to her pregnancy.
66  In my view Dr. Smith was too dismissive of the significant indications that Ms. Zhang was experiencing psychiatric difficulties prior to her pregnancy and loss of her unborn child. In particular, I conclude that he placed far too much reliance on Dr. To's single clinical record and did not adequately explore Ms. Zhang's pre pregnancy condition. I also find it quite singular that Dr. Smith agreed that chronic pain can be a significant risk factor for depression but failed to address this factor in any detail in his report.
67  In the period between March 4, 2001 and December 2002, Ms. Zhang had been injured in the motor vehicle accident which caused her virtually constant pain and which she believed caused her cognitive difficulties, had learned that her husband had a life threatening heart condition, had lost a child after being pregnant for 8 months, and had terminated a subsequent pregnancy for medical reasons. In my view the depression which either developed or became acute in late 2002 was caused by a combination of the above factors. All of the doctors who testified agreed that chronic pain and MTBI are significant risk factors for depression. I conclude that the depression was an indivisible injury and that the injuries suffered in the motor vehicle accident were a necessary contributing cause of the depression.
68  I do not think it necessary to decide whether Ms. Zhang is currently suffering from major depression or from adjustment disorder with depression, or merely from some depressive symptoms. What is clear is that she has suffered from significant depressive symptoms since late 2002 at the latest. Dr. Du reports that in August 2008 he administered the Beck Depression Inventory (Chinese Revision) to Ms. Zhang and that she reported moderate to severe levels of sadness, failure, guilt, self-blame and hopelessness. In his view, Ms. Zhang's profile was suggestive of a severe level of depressive symptoms. While there is some level of disagreement among the doctors, all seem to agree that at minimum Ms. Zhang continues to exhibit depressive symptoms.
69  I did note that Ms. Zhang demonstrated a flat affect when giving her evidence in the witness stand. This is consistent with the report of Dr. Du.
70  I will return to the role that this depression has played in Ms. Zhang's life later in these reasons. Before doing so however I will deal with the question of whether Ms. Zhang suffers from thoracic outlet syndrome. Dr. Salvian was of the opinion that Ms. Zhang suffered from thoracic outlet syndrome. However the weight of medical evidence before me was that there were not sufficient indicators present to justify a diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome. Of course the very concept of whether thoracic outlet syndrome is a recognizable condition is still somewhat controversial. Having considered all of the medical evidence I conclude that the plaintiff has not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that she suffers from this condition.
71  This is of course not to say that Ms. Zhang does not suffer from chronic pain. Whether the pain is attributable to organic or psychological causes it is very real to Ms. Zhang. The consensus of the medical evidence before me is that Ms. Zhang will continue to experience significant pain for the rest of her life. Any pain which has not resolved in the eight years subsequent to the accident is unlikely to resolve in the future. With the possible exception of the low back pain associated with the probable injury to her coccyx it is impossible to determine whether this pain is organic or psychological in origin. However, given my finding that the injuries Ms. Zhang suffered in the accident were a necessary cause of her depression it is not necessary for me to determine the origin of the pain.
72  In summary I conclude that Ms. Zhang continues to suffer depressive symptoms, pain and fatigue. I find that there has been cognitive impairment caused by the MTBI and the depressive symptoms. I also find that the chance of any significant improvement in her condition in the future is remote.
73  Before turning to a discussion of damages I will briefly address the legal arguments made before me. Mr. Murray's primary submission was that the depression suffered by Ms. Zhang was not caused by the negligence of the defendants. In my view this case is governed by the principles enunciated in the Supreme Court of Canada in Athey v. Leonati . On the issue of causation I have already found that the injuries suffered in the motor vehicle accident were a necessary cause of the depression. To paraphrase paragraph 41 of Athey, I have found that it was necessary to have both the injuries from the accident and the non-tortious causes for the depression to occur. As in Athey, I have concluded that it was the combination of the accident, the effect of Mr. Chen's illness, the loss of the foetus and the termination of the second pregnancy which caused the major and continuing depression. The depression and continuing depressive symptoms are, in my opinion, an indivisible injury. The other sources of Ms. Zhang's difficulties, soft tissue injury and MTBI, are of course entirely attributable to the accident.
74  The analysis of damage does not end with causation. It is still necessary to consider whether there was some realistic chance that the depression would have occurred without the motor vehicle accident. This does not go to the issue of causation but rather to the question of assessing damages which will restore Ms. Zhang to her original position. If her original position included a realistic chance that she would have suffered a depression in any event, the principles of compensation require some reduction in the damages awarded to avoid putting her in a better position than she would have been in had she not received compensation for the accident. It goes without saying that "better" does not mean better in fact but better notionally because she will have received adequate monetary compensation for the damages caused by the defendants' negligence.
75  In this case the analysis is further complicated. Of the three causes of Ms. Zhang's ongoing problems, pain, MTBI, and depression, only depression could be said to have been a realistic chance in the absence of the accident. On the evidence before me I find that, although the accident was a necessary cause of the depression, there was never the less a realistic chance that Ms. Zhang would have suffered a major depression in any event. That realistic chance must be taken into account in assessing damages.
76  I was referred to a great many cases by counsel. I mean no disrespect to the diligence of counsel by not referring to each of those cases specifically. Having considered them I simply do not think that they establish any additional principles applicable to this case to those set out in Athey, as explained in Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke, , Hutchings v. Dow , and the other cases I will refer to specifically.
77  Given my findings as to the extent of Ms. Zhang's injuries from the accident a substantial award for non-pecuniary damages is appropriate. As I have already indicated, my task is to make an award of damages which, so far as money is able, will restore Ms. Zhang to her original position. The evidence before me is that before the accident Ms. Zhang was an outgoing and intelligent person with a positive attitude to life. She was able to combine long hours of work with numerous activities which gave her pleasure. She enjoyed walking and socializing with friends. She and her husband went to movies and went ballroom dancing. She enjoyed music. Ms. Zhang and Mr. Chen also had fulfilling marital relations.
78  All of the above activities have been profoundly affected by the injuries Ms. Zhang suffered in the accident. Ms. Zhang is no longer outgoing but reclusive. Most of her energy is devoted to working her shift at Safeway. At the end of each shift the combination of pain and fatigue preclude her from engaging in social activities. She can no longer tolerate music. The couple no longer goes to movies or dancing. There has been a significant decline in marital relations. While some of these outcomes are undoubtedly related to Ms. Zhang's ongoing depressive symptoms, they are largely the result of the other injuries suffered in the accident. Taking into account the impact of these injuries on Ms. Zhang's life while at the same time recognizing the realistic chance that Ms. Zhang would have had to cope with depression in any event, I award non-pecuniary damages of <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$125,000</damage>.
79  It is very difficult to assess an appropriate amount for loss of past earning capacity in this case. Immediately prior to the accident Ms. Zhang was essentially self employed at the D-Top Market. From the time of the accident to her hospitalization for the complications of her pregnancy, she worked at D-Top, but extra help was also required. I have no doubt that the benefits she received from D-Top are not fully reflected in the amount of income attributed to her on her income tax return. Nevertheless her income from D-Top was modest. In addition Ms. Zhang would inevitably have experienced a loss of income as a result of the tragic circumstances of her pregnancy. I would also make some discount in this head of damages for the realistic chance of Ms. Zhang experiencing post-partum depression even without the accident. Perhaps the best evidence of Ms. Zhang's past income earning capacity is the income she has been earning at Safeway since 2006. In light of all of the above circumstances, I award damages for loss of past earning capacity of <damage type = "past wage loss">$60,000</damage>.
80  By far the most challenging question before me with respect to damages is to determine what should be awarded for loss of future earning capacity. In this case there is more than a substantial possibility of loss of future earning capacity. It follows from the findings I have made above that Ms. Zhang has suffered a significant loss of her capacity to earn income as a result of the accident. This is particularly so given my finding of a loss of cognitive ability. It is trite to say that I must approach this question on the basis that I am assessing the extent of the impairment of a capital asset, Ms. Zhang's capacity to earn future income.
81  Mr. Brown submits that I should assess damages in this category on the basis that Ms. Zhang has suffered virtually a total loss of her income earning capacity, and that I should base the assessment on the assumption that Ms. Zhang had a prior capacity to work at least in a semi skilled occupation. He relied on actuarial tables from Statistics Canada put into evidence through Mr. Struthers to show the range of potential incomes that a semi skilled person of Ms. Zhang's age and sex could expect to earn up to age 70.
82  Before turning to a quantitative analysis of this issue I must make some findings of fact to which that analysis can be applied. At the outset I will address the question of Ms. Zhang's current capacity to earn income. Mr. Murray submits that Ms. Zhang has demonstrated the capacity to retain full time employment at Safeway and the functional testing done by Mr. Wallace does not demonstrate any significant impairment of her capacity to perform unskilled work such as a delicatessen clerk. He also points to the evidence of Dr. Travlos to the effect that Ms. Zhang should be able to continue to work 32 to 40 hours per week at Safeway.
83  Mr. Brown points to the toll that working full time has taken on Ms. Zhang. He submits, relying on the evidence of Dr. Salvian and on Mr. Chen's and Ms. Zhang's testimony, that it not reasonable to assume that she will be able to continue to work to age 70 at anything like her present level.
84  In my view there is a substantial possibility that Ms. Zhang will not be able to maintain her present level of activity at work. Her ongoing pain and depression may well force her to reduce her hours of work. The substantial possibility that Ms. Zhang's current employment is unsustainable must be taken into account in assessing her claim for loss of future income earning capacity.
85  On the other hand I do not think that Ms. Zhang has demonstrated more than a desire to upgrade her skills beyond the level that she has pursued since immigrating in 1991. In the ten years up to the time of the accident, despite working with the public at D-Top Market, her facility in English remained limited. There is no evidence that in that period of time she took any steps to upgrade her skills or qualifications. These factors are of course not responsive to the issue of liability for the loss of capacity but they are factors to be taken into consideration in assessing the value of what she has lost.
86  According to the evidence presented by Mr. Struthers the present value of the income earning capacity of a semi skilled worker to age 67, assuming contingencies for average risks, is <damage type = "other">$632,000</damage>. The same figure for unskilled workers is <damage type = "other">$370,000</damage>. The difference between the two figures is <damage type = "other">$262,000</damage> (all figures are rounded to the nearest <damage type = "other">$1000</damage>). However, simply awarding this difference does not take into account the substantial possibility that Ms. Zhang will not be able to sustain her present employment. On the other hand it also fails to recognize the substantial obstacles that Ms. Zhang, even in her original position, faced to upgrading her occupational and language skills.
87  In approaching this question, I find guidance in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Rosvold v. Dunlop, . In that case, Madam Justice Huddard referred to Brown v. Golaiy . In that decision, Mr. Justice Finch (as he then was) set out four basic considerations in assessing damages for lost of future income earning capacity. I need not repeat the criteria from that case in these reasons. However, bearing them in mind and remembering the admonition from Rosvold that damages must be assessed and not calculated I award damages for this head of damages at <damage type = "future wage loss">$300,000</damage>.
88  Ms. Zhang also makes claims for cost of future care and past and future loss of homemaking capacity. I am not persuaded that I should break down these heads of damage in the detailed way that Mr. McNeil approaches the matter in his report. In my view some of the items he addresses are covered by the award for non- pecuniary damages. I do however think that Ms. Zhang has suffered a significant impairment of her capacity to perform homemaking tasks, particularly of a heavier nature. The total claimed for these three categories is approximately <damage type = "other">$70,000</damage>. I award <damage type = "future care">$50,000</damage> for these three categories.
89  In his oral submissions I understood Mr. Brown to agree to an award for special damages of <damage type = "special">$1,234</damage>, as submitted by the defendants. I award special damages in that amount.
90  In summary I award the following:
 (a) Non-pecuniary damages <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$125,000</damage> 
 (b) Loss of past income capacity <damage type = "past wage loss">$60,000</damage> 
 (c) Loss of future income capacity <damage type = "future wage loss">$300,000</damage> 
Cost of future care, loss of homemaking capacity <damage type = "future care">$50,000</damage>
 (e) Special Damages <damage type = "special">$1,234</damage> 
 Total <damage type = "total">$536,234</damage> 
91  If counsel are unable to agree on such matters as court order interest, tax gross up and tax treatment of the award they may arrange to make further submissions.
92  Counsel may also make further submissions with respect to costs.

Between Tammy Marion Carol Chamberlain and Gary Ronald Chamberlain, Plaintiffs, and Pro Star Mechanical Technologies Ltd. and Trane Canada Co., Defendants
(76 paras.)
Case Summary
Construction law — Liability — Grounds — Breach of contract — Defective workmanship — Negligence — Damages — Action by plaintiffs for damages for breach of contract and negligence allowed — Plaintiffs retained defendant to design and install geothermal exchange system to heat and cool newly built home — Defendant failed to design and deliver proper functioning unit — System was negligently designed and installed — Plaintiffs awarded <damage type = "general">$29,535</damage> for losses and expenses consequential to defendant's negligence and breach of contract plus <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$15,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages for mental distress and loss of enjoyment of life caused by breach of contract.
Action by the plaintiffs, Tammy and Ronald Chamberlain, against the defendant, Pro Star Mechanical Technologies, for damages for negligence and breach of contract. The plaintiffs built a home and retained the defendant to design and install a geothermal exchange system to heat and cool the home. Upon moving into the home, the plaintiffs encountered issues with the system. Although efforts were made to rectify the matter, the system never worked to the plaintiffs' satisfaction. The plaintiffs alleged that the system was negligently denied and installed. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant breached the express terms of the parties' contract when it failed to install a system that met the performance specifications therein, breached an implied term that the pond required for the system was of sufficient depth, and breached an implied condition that the system would be reasonably fit for the purpose of heating and cooling their home. They sought damages to compensate for the replacement of the system. 

HELD: Action allowed.
 The defendant failed to design and deliver a properly functioning and efficient system in breach of the express terms of the contract. The ductwork installed by the defendant was deficient, the pipes were improperly insulated, the heat pump failed to function as required and malfunctioned consistently. The defendant failed to ensure the plaintiffs were informed of the dimensions of the pond and that the pond was sufficient for the system. Similarly, the system was not fit for the purpose it was purchased in breach of the Sale of Goods Act. The expert evidence established that the system was negligently designed and installed. There was no grounds for finding that the plaintiffs were contributorily negligent. The plaintiffs were awarded <damage type = "general">$29,535</damage> for the losses and expenses consequential to the defendant's negligence and breach of contract plus a further <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$15,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages for the mental distress and loss of enjoyment of life caused by the defendant's breach of contract.

Reasons for Judgment
G.R.J. GAUL J.
1   In 2007, the plaintiffs Tammy and Gary Chamberlain purchased property in Shawnigan Lake on Vancouver Island and started building a dream home for themselves and their two school-aged children. During the course of the construction, the plaintiffs retained the defendant Pro Star Mechanical Technologies Ltd. ("Pro Star") to design and install a geothermal exchange system ("GXS") as a means of heating and cooling their home.
2  The plaintiffs moved into their new house in or around November 2007. Shortly thereafter problems arose with the GXS that Pro Star had installed. Although efforts were made to rectify the situation, the GXS never worked to the plaintiffs' satisfaction.
3  In the present action, the plaintiffs seek an award of damages from Pro Star for breach of contract and in negligence. The plaintiffs' claim against the second named defendant, Trane Canada Co. ("Trane"), was discontinued on 27 January 2012 and consequently it took no further part in these proceedings.
Issues
4  The three principal questions to answer in this lawsuit are:
Did Pro Star breach its contract with the plaintiffs?
Was Pro Star negligent in the work it performed for the plaintiffs?
If there was a breach of contract and or negligence on the part of Pro Star, what damages have the plaintiffs suffered?
Facts
The Plaintiffs
5  Mr. Chamberlain is a Petty Officer Second Class with the Royal Canadian Navy and has been a member of the Canadian Armed Forces for approximately 19 years. During the time relevant to this litigation, he was stationed and working at Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt. Given the nature and intensity of his work, Mr. Chamberlain was often away from home for extended periods of time and consequently the principal manager of the plaintiffs' household and the de facto general contractor for the construction of their Shawnigan Lake home was his wife, Tammy Chamberlain.
6  Neither of the plaintiffs had ever been involved in the construction of a house before, nor did they have any prior experience or knowledge regarding the design and installation of residential heating and cooling systems, including GXSs.
The Defendant
7  Pro Star is a British Columbia company that was incorporated in 1988. Pro Star's business includes designing, installing and servicing residential and commercial plumbing, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems, including GXSs.
8  Mr. Wilfred Scheuer is the owner and founding president of Pro Star. Mr. Scheuer holds a certification from the instructor's program in plumbing, heating and air conditioning from Purdue University in Indiana, U.S.A. and is a trade qualified journeyman steamfitter. He is also a certified refrigeration mechanic and gas fitter and a Canadian Construction Association "Gold Seal Certified" project manager. According to Mr. Scheuer, this latter designation is similar to a bachelor's degree in construction management. Finally, Mr. Scheuer is certified by the Canadian GeoExchange Coalition to design and install GXSs.
9  While Mr. Scheuer is regularly involved in the day-to-day operations of Pro Star, including dealing with clients and preparing quotes for projects, he is not generally involved in the actual installation of heating and cooling systems. Since 1988, Pro Star has installed approximately 100 GXSs, 25 of which have been similar to the one it designed and installed for the plaintiffs.
Geothermal Exchange Systems - The Basics
10  A residential GXS has three essential components:
a circuit of underground or underwater pipes outside of the house;
a heat pump located inside the house to which the circuit of pipes is attached; and
ductwork to distribute the heated or cooled air from the heat pump throughout the house.
11  A GXS can either be an "open-loop" or "closed-loop" system. An open-loop GXS uses ground water as its source of energy. In simple terms, a continual flow of water is drawn into a heat pump from an established source (e.g., a well). By means of a compressor in the heat pump, heat is extracted from the water and transferred to the air being circulated in the building. After the energy exchange has occurred, the water is discharged from the heat pump and returned to the environment (e.g., another well), thus completing the "open" circuit. In warmer weather, the heat-transfer process can be reversed and the heat pump can be used to cool warm air drawn from the house.
12  A closed-loop GXS operates on the same energy extraction principles as an open-loop GXS, without the residual discharge of the energy source (i.e., water) into the environment. A closed-loop GXS collects energy from the ground or a body of water (e.g., a pond) via a continuous circuit of underground or underwater pipes connected to a heat pump. An antifreeze solution is circulated through the pipes, and again by means of a compressor in the heat pump, heat is extracted from the solution and transferred to the air in the house. The cooling mode of the heat pump allows for the reversal of this process. Unlike an open-loop GXS where the water is returned to the environment, the antifreeze solution in the closed-loop never leaves the pipes or the heat pump.
The Plaintiffs' GXS
13  In the early part of 2007, the plaintiffs began investigating the possibility of using a GXS as the principal means of heating and cooling their home. As a result of his research, Mr. Chamberlain contacted Pro Star. In his initial conversation with Mr. Scheuer, Mr. Chamberlain indicated that he and his wife wished to have a GXS installed in the home they were building. Subsequent to that conversation, Mr. Chamberlain provided Mr. Scheuer with a copy of the plan drawings for their home. Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain also met with Mr. Scheuer at their Shawnigan Lake property and escorted him about the property so that he could get a better understanding and appreciation of its dimensions and its surroundings.
14  There were further discussions between the plaintiffs and Mr. Scheuer regarding the type of GXS that would best suit the Chamberlains' needs. Eventually the plaintiffs chose a pond-based, closed-loop GXS (the "Chamberlain GXS"). The Chamberlain GXS consisted of six essential elements:
a pond with sufficient water to act as both a thermal energy source for heating and a thermal energy sink for cooling (the "Pond");
a pond heat exchanger ("PHX") consisting of a series of loops of plastic pipe containing an antifreeze solution, placed at the bottom of the Pond and connected to a heat pump inside the house;
a heat pump to circulate the antifreeze solution through the PHX loops and to extract and transfer the energy derived from the PHX to the house and vice versa;
an auxiliary electric heating coil for use in the event the heat pump malfunctions or cannot extract energy from the PHX;
a forced-air unit to distribute throughout the house the air that has been warmed or cooled by the heat pump; and
ductwork to channel the heated or cooled air from the heat pump to the various rooms in the house.
The Contract
15  Neither party disputes the fact that a valid contract existed between them for the design and installation of the Chamberlain GXS (the "Contract"). The terms of the Contract were set out in the following email dated 6 June 2007 from Mr. Scheuer to Mr. Chamberlain:
Hello.

16  Within a few days of receiving Mr. Scheuer's email, Mr. Chamberlain contacted him and confirmed that the plaintiffs accepted Pro Star's proposal. Having received the go-ahead from the plaintiffs, Pro Star began work on the design of the Chamberlain GXS.
17  Towards the end of July 2007, Pro Star began installing the ductwork at the plaintiffs' home. Around this same time, the plaintiffs began the excavation of the Pond. The heat pump was delivered to the plaintiffs' residence in August. In September 2007, the heat pump was installed in the basement of the plaintiffs' home and the PHX was installed in the Pond.
18  By the end of October 2007, Pro Star had completed its work on the Chamberlain GXS and had issued its final invoice to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs paid that invoice which brought the total amount they had paid to Pro Star to <damage type = "other">$31,253.04</damage>.
19  The plaintiffs moved into their new home towards the end of November 2007.
The Depth of the Pond
20  Much evidence was led at trial about the Pond that was needed for the Chamberlain GXS and particularly what depth the plaintiffs were told it needed to be so that the PHX would function properly.
21  Mr. Chamberlain testified that prior to starting the excavation of the Pond, Mr. Scheuer told him that it needed to be as deep as possible and that the loops in the PHX had to be covered by at least seven feet of water. In cross-examination, Mr. Chamberlain disagreed with the suggestion that Mr. Scheuer had told him that the Pond needed to be 20 feet deep. Mr. Chamberlain insisted that Mr. Scheuer had told him that the pipes in the Pond needed to be covered by 7 feet of water.
22  Mrs. Chamberlain testified that she specifically asked Mr. Scheuer how deep the Pond needed to be, when she, her husband and Mr. Scheuer toured the Chamberlain property in the summer of 2007. Mrs. Chamberlain was firm in her evidence that Mr. Scheuer said the Pond needed to be a minimum of 9 feet with 2 feet of water for the loops of pipe and at least 7 feet of water above the loops. Like Mr. Chamberlain, Mrs. Chamberlain was steadfast in her contention that Mr. Scheuer had never told her that the Pond needed to be 20 feet deep.
23  In his examination-in-chief, Mr. Scheuer testified that at his initial meeting in the summer of 2007 with the plaintiffs on their property, he told them that their Pond needed to be 25 feet deep. His testimony included the following:
 Q:  Did the Chamberlains tell you anything else about what they proposed to do with the area for the pond, such as how big they were going to make it, the area, the depth, anything like that? 
 A:  There was a discussion with the Chamberlains regarding the previous contractor that was there, and they brought up some points that he told them about the pond. 
****
 Q:  Did they tell you that they were going to be making it of any particular area or depth? 
 A: I don't recall the exact size, no. 
 Q:  Did you make any recommendation or instruction at that point about the size or depth of the pond? 
 A: Yes. 
 Q: What did you say? 
 A:  I said it was a very small pond for a dew application. The only way it could work is if it was significantly made deeper. 
 Q:  When you say "it was a small pond", do you mean what you were looking at with the weeds coming out of it, two, three, four feet deep? 
 A:  Well that, plus the contour of the road and you could see where there could be a pond. So, even excavating it you are still going to get a fairly small pond. 
 Q:  So, was it what was proposed by the Chamberlains you thought was still going to be a small pond? 
 A: Yes. 
 Q:  Did you tell them of any particular depth that the pond should be, at that meeting? 
 A: Yes. 
 Q: What was that? 
 A:  20... 25 feet is my standard answer now. I might have said more, but I believe 25 feet. 
24  When cross-examined regarding his discussion with the plaintiffs about the depth of the pond, Mr. Scheuer testified:
 Q:  In your direct evidence you said this was the quote that you produced after your attendance at the site of the Chamberlains, right? 
 A: Correct. 
 Q:  And in that site visit, there was no pond that was present. It was simply the intention of the Chamberlains to create a pond out of the marshy area that you observed? 
 A: Correct. 
 Q:  And you did not provide any express direction as to how deep that pond would have to be, did you? 
 A: We discussed it verbally yes. 
***
 Q:  You have no specific recollection of telling the Chamberlains how deep the pond had to be, do you? 
 A:  I do, because they brought up a discussion they had with the previous contractor and they talked about the size of it with him quite thoroughly and they brought that up. 
 Q:  So you have a specific recollection of telling the Chamberlains how deep the pond had to be? 
 A:  The exact number, I do not. But based on our standard procedure, our normal range for ponds is from 20 minimum to 30 feet. 
 Q:  So I appreciate that you are saying what you usually tell people, but that is not what I am asking you. I'm asking you what you said to the Chamberlains for their pond, in terms of depth? 
 A: I can't remember verbatim of that meeting. 
 Q: In fact you can't recall at all. 
 A:  I can recall the discussion because it was a deep discussion about the pond from the previous contractor, so I remember that part very well. 
 Q:  You did not tell the Chamberlains that the pond had to be 20 feet deep, did you? 
 A:  I would have told them 20 to 30, but the exact wording I do not remember. 
 Q:  I did not ask you what you would have told them. I asked you what you did tell them? 
 A: I can't remember a verbatim conversation. 
25  In my opinion, the evidence of the plaintiffs with respect to what Mr. Scheuer said about the required depth of the Pond is more reliable than that of Mr. Scheuer. Both of the plaintiffs were convincing when they testified that Mr. Scheuer had told them the Pond needed to have 7 feet of water above the PHX loops and that there had never been any suggestion that it needed to be anywhere near 20 to 25 feet deep. Mr. Scheuer, on the other hand was vague in his testimony, notwithstanding his assertion that he recalled his conversation with the Chamberlains clearly. The depth of the Pond was a critical issue for the proper functioning of the PHX and the GXS as a whole. Although the plaintiffs were responsible for excavating the Pond, they needed to know how deep they should make it. The only qualified person to tell them and the logical person to tell them was the person responsible for designing the GXS, Mr. Scheuer. In an email to Mrs. Chamberlain dated 17 February 2009, Mr. Scheuer indicated that the pond was "not as deep as originally assumed it would be" (emphasis added). In another email exchange between Mrs. Chamberlain and Mr. Scheuer on 22 February 2010, Mrs. Chamberlain reiterated to Mr. Scheuer that he had told her and her husband in the summer of 2007 that the Pond only needed to have 7 feet of water above the PHX loops. Mr. Scheuer replied with "I do not recall saying 7 feet. That is pretty shallow." Nowhere in his response does he assert, as one would have expected were it true, that he told them the depth of the Pond needed to be 20 - 25 feet.
26  I accept the evidence of the plaintiffs that the Pond was excavated to a depth of approximately 10 feet when the PHX loops were installed in September 2007. I also accept that the size of the pond was increased in May 2008, June 2009 and June 2010, on the advice or direction of Pro Star.
Breach of Contract
27  The plaintiffs assert that Pro Star breached the express terms of the Contract when it failed to install a GXS that met the performance specifications the parties had agreed to in the Contract. Moreover, the plaintiffs maintain that Pro Star breached the implied condition that the GXS would be reasonably fit for the purpose of heating and cooling their home efficiently, contrary to the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 410. Finally, the plaintiffs maintain that the Pond's suitability for the GXS was an additional implied term of the Contract, and that Pro Star breached that term by failing to confirm prior to its installation of the PHX that the Pond was sufficient for the purposes of the GXS.
28  The defendant Pro Star says it fulfilled all aspects of the Contract, including the provision and installation of the GXS. Pro Star further asserts that the services and goods it provided to the Chamberlains were of merchantable quality and suitable for the purposes for which they were sold and consequently they met all of the requirements of the Sales of Goods Act. Finally, Pro Star denies there was an implied term of the Contract that it would ensure the Pond was of a sufficient depth for the purposes of the Chamberlain GXS.
Breach of Express Terms of the Contract
29  The Contract between the parties was for the provision of a GXS at a price and with the specifications set out in Pro Star's email of 6 June 2007. The plaintiffs say they did not get from Pro Star what they were entitled to and what they paid for under the Contract; that is, a functioning GXS that provided and had "very efficient operating costs". On the evidence before me, I find that:
The ductwork installed by Pro Star was deficient, including a failure to install the proper number of air outlets;
Pro Star failed to properly insulate the pipes around the heat pump, leading to excessive condensation;
The heat pump installed by Pro Star was unduly loud and vibrated excessively. On one occasion the vibration caused an electrical arc that melted some of the heat pump's wiring, resulting in a strong odour of burnt electronics entering the plaintiffs' living space. On another occasion, the heat pump made so much unusual noise that Mr. Chamberlain was required to turn off the power to the heat pump. When he went to the basement to investigate, there was smoke coming from the heat pump.
When the heat pump was operating and supposedly warming the plaintiffs' house, there was an uneven distribution of warm air throughout the house resulting in a wide variation of temperatures in the various rooms.
Between February 2008 and November 2010, the heat pump malfunctioned and ceased operating approximately 250 times. Most often the malfunction caused the auxiliary electric heating system to engage resulting in a higher consumption of hydroelectricity.
The PHX installed by Pro Star was not connected or installed properly. Efforts by Pro Star between 2008 and 2010 to repair the Chamberlain GXS, were unsuccessful and it was never able to determine why the GXS did not operate as it was supposed to.
The Chamberlain GXS continued to fail throughout 2010 and into 2011. In particular, the heat pump continued to malfunction and cease operating. In May 2011, Jason Rockson of Mercury Refrigeration Products & Services Ltd., ("Mercury"), a competitor of Pro Star who had been retained by Pro Star to assist in investigating the problems with the Chamberlain GXS, was hired by the plaintiffs to remove and replace the GSX, including the PHX that had been installed by Pro Star. In December 2011, Mercury installed a new heat pump and adapted the ductwork in the plaintiffs' home.
Since the installation of the new GXS by Mercury, the plaintiffs have not faced the problems they did with their former GXS.
30  In my view the plaintiffs are correct when they claim that Pro Star failed to design and deliver a properly functioning and efficient GXS in breach of the express terms of the Contract.
Breach of the Sale of Goods Act
31  The plaintiffs also argue that by failing to provide a properly designed, installed and functioning GXS, Pro Star breached s. 18(a) of the Sale of Goods Act and the implied term of the Contract that the GXS would be reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was purchased. That statutory provision provides:
Implied conditions as to quality or fitness
18 Subject to this and any other Act, there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale or lease, except as follows:
if the buyer or lessee, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller or lessor the particular purpose for which the goods are required, so as to show that the buyer or lessee relies on the seller's or lessor's skill or judgment, and the goods are of a description that it is in the course of the seller's or lessor's business to supply, whether the seller or lessor is the manufacturer or not, there is an implied condition that the goods are reasonably fit for that purpose; except that in the case of a contract for the sale or lease of a specified article under its patent or other trade name, there is no implied condition as to its fitness for any particular purpose.
32  In my view this provision of the Sale of Goods Act applies to the Contract, given that Pro Star's regular business includes the design and installation of GXSs and the plaintiffs made it known to Pro Star that they were relying upon its expertise and advice in their selection of a GXS. The "trade name exception" does not apply in this case.
33  Pro Star maintains that the Sale of Goods Act does not require that a product be suitable for every purpose within the range of purposes for which it is sold. According to Pro Star, it is sufficient that the product sold is suitable for one or more of those purposes.
34  The question that I must answer is whether Pro Star breached the implied warranty regarding the quality and fitness of the Chamberlain GXS. In my view, there is ample evidence that, notwithstanding the significant efforts of Pro Star, the Chamberlain GXS never functioned properly and continually failed to provide efficient heating and cooling of the plaintiffs' home. The failure of the heat pump resulted in the plaintiffs having to rely on the auxiliary electric heating coil to heat their home at increased hydroelectric costs. Moreover, I accept the plaintiffs' evidence that the forced air unit and the ductwork failed to distribute the warmed air evenly throughout their home and at times the temperature in the house dropped to the low 60s Fahrenheit.
35  In my opinion, the GXS designed and installed by Pro Star was not fit for the purpose it was purchased and therefore there was a breach of the Sale of Goods Act.
Breach of Implied Term of the Contract: Depth of the Pond
36  The Contract that Pro Star proposed to the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs accepted expressly excluded "excavation or backfill". While the wording could have been more precise, the parties agree this term meant the plaintiffs were responsible for the excavation of the Pond.
37  Although the plaintiffs acknowledge that the creation of the Pond was their responsibility, they point to fact that the Contract expressly required Pro Star to "fabricate and install geo loop coil pond loop". With this latter fact in mind, the plaintiffs assert that the Contract included an implied term that Pro Star would properly advise them of necessary dimensions of the Pond, and in particular its depth, to ensure it was suitable for the PHX Pro Star was to design and install.
38  Pro Star denies that the Contract contained any implied term regarding the creation of the Pond. In this regard, it points to what it says is the clear wording of the Contract that excluded it from having anything to do with the Pond.
39  In Bank of Nova Scotia v. Horgan  (C.A.), the British Columbia Court of Appeal considered and reviewed the law on implied terms of contracts. In doing so the court adopted a number of principles articulated in the jurisprudence of the United Kingdom. At paras. 18 to 20 of his reasons, Hinkson J.A. explained:
[18] The first of those decisions commonly cited in this context is Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Company (Ramsbottom) Ltd. (1918) 1 K.B. 592. Lord Justice Scrutton said at p. 605:
"A term can only be implied if it is necessary in the business sense to give efficacy to the contract; that is, if it is such a term that it can confidently be said that if at the time the contract was being negotiated someone had said to the parties, "What will happen in such a case," they would both have replied, "Of course, so and so will happen; we did not trouble to say that; it is too clear." Unless the Court comes to some such conclusion as that, it ought not to imply a term which the parties themselves have not expressed."
[19] The next case in this line often referred to is Shirlaw v. Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd. (1939) 2 K.B. 206, affirmed [1940] A.C. 707. MacKinnon, L.J. said at p. 227:
"... "Prima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common 'Oh, of course!'"
[20] Finally, I will refer to the decision in Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd. v. Cooper [1941] A.C. 108. Lord Wright said at p. 137:
"The general presumption is that the parties have expressed every material term which they intended should govern their agreement, whether oral or in writing. But it is well recognized that there may be cases where obviously some term must be implied if the intention of the parties is not to be defeated, some term of which it can be predicated that "it goes without saying," some term not expressed but necessary to give the transaction such business efficacy as the parties must have intended."
40  In my opinion, it was logical and necessary that Pro Star should inform the plaintiffs of the essential dimensions of the Pond and would ensure the Pond was sufficient and appropriate before installing the PHX. In my view this responsibility of Pro Star's was an implied term of the Contract. It is clear on the evidence that the plaintiffs relied on Mr. Scheuer to tell them how deep to dig the Pond and that without his advice they would not have known what depth was needed for the proper functioning of the GXS Pro Star was designing. The plaintiffs did not have any expertise in this area; whereas Pros Star clearly did.
41  The evidence is uncontroverted that the dimensions of the Pond, including its depth, were essential to the proper operation of the Chamberlain GXS. While Pro Star was not responsible for the actual excavation of the Pond, in my view it goes without saying that it was responsible to ensure the plaintiffs had the proper and necessary dimensions for the Pond before they commenced their work. Moreover, it was incumbent upon Pro Star to ensure the Pond was appropriate before it installed the PHX. Pro Star contracted with the plaintiffs to provide a GXS that worked properly and therefore it had a vested interest in the Pond being the proper depth. It makes no sense to me to suggest, as Pro Star has, that under the Contract it "had nothing to do with the Pond".
42  In my opinion, Pro Star breached the Contract when it failed to ensure the plaintiffs were properly informed of the dimensions of the Pond and failed to ensure the Pond was sufficient before it installed the PHX.
Negligence
43  Pro Star argues that it met its duty of care to the plaintiffs when it installed a GXS that reasonably fit the purpose for which it was intended. Respectfully, I do not agree. In my view the GXS Pro Star sold to the plaintiffs was not fit for efficiently heating and cooling their home and the reason for that was its negligent design and installation, with particular reference to the PHX.
44  Mr. Daniel Booy is a registered professional engineer with a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Victoria and a diploma in mechanical engineering technology from Camosun College. He is also the president of Altum Engineering Ltd. Mr. Booy testified on behalf of the plaintiffs and was permitted to provided expert opinion evidence on the design, installation and operation of GXSs. Mr. Booy attended at the plaintiffs' residence in January 2010 and observed their GXS in operation. As of March 2010, he could not determine what was causing the on-going malfunctioning of the heat pump. His initial opinion at the time was that the PHX was adequately sized for the Chamberlain GXS.
45  Mr. Booy revised his initial opinion concerning the PHX after he had the opportunity to examine a revised diagram of the PHX and photographs of the PHX loops that had been recently removed from the Pond. In his expert report dated 25 November 2011, Mr. Booy explained his opinion of the PHX as follows:
The BC Building Code references the CSA Standard C448 pertaining to the design and installation of geo-exchange systems:
"9.33.5.2. Appliance Installation Standards
Except as provided in Articles 9.33.5.3. and 9.33.5.4., the installation of heating and air-conditioning equipment, including mechanical refrigeration equipment, and including provisions for mounting, clearances and air supply, shall conform to
CAN/CSA-B139-M, "Installation Code for Oil Burning Equipment," for the installation of oil burning equipment
the BC Safety Standards Act and its following pursuant regulations:
the Gas Safety Regulations for the installation of natural gas and propane burning equipment,
the Electrical Safety Regulation,
the Power Engineers, Boiler, Pressure Vessel and Refrigeration Safety Regulation for the installation of boilers, pressure vessels, pressure piping and mechanical refrigeration,
CAN/CSA-B365-M, "Installation Code for Solid-Fuel Burning Appliances and Equipment," or
CAN/CSA-C448-M, "Design and Installation of Earth Energy Systems." (See also Sentence 9.33.5.3. (1).)"
In my opinion, the installation shown in the above referenced files does not conform to the CSA Standard C448. It is my opinion that the installation of the original non-conforming PHX either led to or contributed to the "lock-outs" that were reported by the Owner. This finding led to a change of my opinion regarding the PHX compared to what I expressed in my review report called "Shawnigan Review Letter - Final Copy", dated March 12, 2010. I had previously suspected that the PHX was adequate to serve the building, but my site visit was on a relatively warm winter day and it is now my opinion that the PHX was operating poorly during colder weather and higher loading scenarios.
The following items caused me to revise my opinion regarding the effectiveness of the PHX:
The three parallel 3/4-inch diameter 600 ft long PHX circuits were connected to 1-inch diameter run-out pipes to convey fluid to/from the heat pump. This run-out piping should have, in my opinion been 1-1/4 inch diameter with four 3/4-inch diameter 600 ft long PHX circuits connected to it. This would provide more flow area in the run-out piping and more surface area in the PHX piping, resulting in more effective heat exchange from the relatively small pond.
All pipes in the PHX should have been high density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic pipes with heat fusion joints only. All PHX pipes not in the pond should have been buried underground. The photos provided to me show metallic fittings with above ground components. In addition to losing energy from being exposed to the surface air, the installed fittings wouldn't, in my opinion, be dependable in the long term. CSA Standard C448 indicates that all piping should be fused HDPE buried underground.
The PHX circuits (bundles of piping) shown in the photos are not, in my opinion, acceptably configured to optimize heat transfer into the pipes. In my opinion, PHX circuits should be well spaced in a configuration similar to that shown in the new installation photos.
In my opinion, the size of the pond should have triggered the installer to provide longer, well-spaced piping. Due to the layout of the PHX, it is my opinion that the PHX would not have provided an adequate amount of thermal energy to the heat pump. In my opinion, that would eventually lead to lock-outs of the heat pump during cooler weather events.
In addition to causing these "lock-outs", it is my opinion that the non-conforming PHX would have caused undue stress on the heat pump and that the life expectancy of the heat pump would have been compromised due to the operating condition resulting from connection to the PHX.
The provision of the above referenced data allows me to firmly stand behind my opinion that the PHX was a leading cause of system failure in this installation.
46  In Mr. Booy's opinion, the PHX loops should have been laid out on the bottom of the Pond in a "slinky" fashion instead of simply piled on top of themselves with random spacers placed between the coils. He also opined that the ductwork installed by Pro Star was substandard in that it did not provide a reasonably even or balanced flow of warm or cool air throughout the plaintiffs' home.
47  Pro Star is critical of Mr. Booy's evidence and submits I should give it little weight because he was biased and more of an advocate in the plaintiffs' favour than an impartial expert witness. Although Mr. Booy did have an ongoing dialogue with the plaintiffs during the preparation of his expert report, I do not find this compromised his ability to be an impartial expert witness. In my view Mr. Booy testified in a direct, fair and objective manner regarding the scientific principles of GXSs and the standards expected of those who design and install these systems. Overall I found him to be a credible and reliable witness and I have accepted his evidence in its entirety, including his expert opinion on the Chamberlain GXS.
48  Both sides agree they discussed the depth of the Pond before it was excavated and in my view this confirms Pro Star knew and accepted that it had a role to play in the creation of the Pond. In my opinion, Pro Star did not examine the Pond properly, either prior to the installation of the PHX or when the problems with the GXS began to arise. This led Mr. Scheuer to blindly recommend to the plaintiffs that they keep making the Pond deeper. In good faith, the plaintiffs followed this advice. The result however was unnecessary trouble and expense for them, without any relief from the problems they were having with their GXS.
49  Pro Star's key failure and the element that created most of the difficulties associated with the Chamberlain GXS is the fact that the PHX loops were coiled on top of themselves and not spread out in the recommended "slinky" style to maximize the available PHX surface for heat exchange. While such a style is not mandatory, the evidence before me is that it is clearly the preferred and recommended approach and the one that makes the most geothermal sense. Mr. Scheuer was not present when the PHX was installed in the Pond. He left that task to his employees and in my view it was incumbent upon him to ensure they knew what they were doing. I am not satisfied he met that standard or that his employees were sufficiently aware of what was required for the proper installation of the PHX. Nor am I satisfied that Pro Star met the standard of care expected of it when it initially installed the PHX loops incorrectly and failed to address the problem in a timely and effective manner.
50  Pro Star was also negligent in the installation of the heat pump itself and the ductwork in the house. The heat pump was unreasonably noisy and vibrated excessively. It was not installed on a vibration pad, as is the norm, but instead on wooden blocks. Pro Star attempted to address air flow issues in the plaintiffs' home but never did provide the number of air outlets required under the Contract.
51  In my view, Pro Star did not meet the CSA standards for the proper design and installation of a GXS, nor did it meet the generally accepted practice standards used in the industry. The plaintiffs summarize their criticism of Pro Star's approach to the PHX as follows:
Rather than design an appropriate pond loop system, Pro Star took the pond loop coils, strapped them in a pile and sank them to some unknown depth in the pond, and then hoped that the heat exchange system would perform correctly.
52  In my opinion, the plaintiffs' assessment of Pro Star's approach to the PHX is accurate. When shown pictures of the PHX loops, Mr. Booy explained that they were not in conformity with the prevailing CSA Standard C448 and summarized his opinion by noting "What I saw, quite frankly, was appalling". I accept Mr. Booy's opinion.
Contributory Negligence of the Plaintiffs
53  Pro Star maintains that the Plaintiffs were contributorily negligent when they failed to follow Mr. Scheuer's direction that the Pond be excavated to a depth of 20 to 25 feet. Pro Star also asserts that the plaintiffs were aware that the Pond was of insufficient depth and failed to take the appropriate steps to rectify the situation.
54  In my opinion, there are no grounds to find the plaintiffs contributorily negligent. To begin with, I reject Pro Star's contention that Mr. Scheuer told the plaintiffs that the Pond needed to be 20 to 25 feet deep. Mr. Scheuer's evidence on this point was not clear and it was definitely not persuasive. The plaintiffs relied upon Mr. Scheuer's expertise and advice and created a Pond that allowed for 7 feet of water above the PHX loops. Moreover, they did their best to comply with what he told them after the PHX was installed and the GXS started malfunctioning. On three separate occasions they increased the Pond's capacity and each time it was as a result of Mr. Scheuer's advice. Moreover, whenever Mr. Scheuer suggested some other cause for the problems (e.g., poor supply of hydroelectricity), the plaintiffs took prompt action to investigate only to have their efforts prove fruitless.
Damages
55  The plaintiff seeks an award of damages for the losses and expenses they incurred as a result of Pro Star's negligence and failure to comply with the Contract. They also seek an award of non-pecuniary damages for the mental and emotional distress they have suffered, including loss of enjoyment of life, as a result of Pro Star's failure to provide them with a properly functioning GXS for their home.
56  In Joubarne v. Loodu, , Madam Justice Arnold-Bailey addressed the issue of damages arising from a breach of contract and the Sale of Goods Act. At paras. 49 and 50, Justice Arnold-Bailey observed:
[49] The SGA confirms that in the event of a breach of condition, a buyer may claim damages for non-delivery. These damages may be regarded as "consequential damages" because they are for the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from the seller's breach.
[50] Under the SGA there are limits to a buyer's right to reject goods for breach of a condition. Under s. 15(4), if a buyer has accepted the goods, then a breach of condition must be treated as a breach of warranty. If this happens, the buyer's remedy is a claim for damages pursuant to s. 56, which states:
If there is a breach of warranty by the seller, or if the buyer elects, or is compelled, to treat any breach of a condition on the part of the seller as a breach of warranty, the buyer is not merely because of the breach of warranty entitled to reject the goods, but the buyer may
set up against the seller the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price, or
maintain an action against the seller for damages for the breach of warranty.
The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of warranty.
57  The plaintiffs say the excess heating and hot water costs they were required to pay on account of Pro Star's actions amount to approximately <damage type = "other">$7,000</damage>. The plaintiffs claim these costs resulted from the GXS's failure and in particular the heat pump's malfunctioning which caused the more expensive auxiliary electrical heating coil to be engaged. Pro Star submits there was no evidence led at trial to support this claim or that would allow the court to infer the amount of additional hydroelectric expenses the plaintiffs may have incurred as a result of any act of Pro Star. In my view Pro Star is correct on this point. While I accept the auxiliary electrical heating system needed to be used more often than anticipated, I am not satisfied that I have the evidence necessary to determine the cost differential between using this auxiliary system as opposed to the heat pump. As such, this claim for damages is denied.
58  The plaintiffs' claim for <damage type = "other">$81.74</damage> for the cost of "supply materials" from Staples Canada is equally vague and unsupported. This claim is denied as well.
59  I accept that the plaintiffs received inaccurate advice and directions from Pro Star regarding the electrical wiring required for the GXS and therefore its consequential claim for <damage type = "other">$400.00</damage> for the rewiring that was required is allowed.
60  When the plaintiffs' troubles began with their GXS they naturally contacted Pro Star for assistance. They relied upon Pro Star to repair the system and fix the problems. On more than one occasion, Mr. Scheuer told the plaintiffs the root of the problem was their Pond and that it needed to be made deeper. The plaintiffs dutifully followed Mr. Scheuer's advice and raised the level of the Pond three times. In May 2008 they engaged the services of Taz Excavating. The cost to raise the Pond was <damage type = "other">$5,528.40</damage>, plus <damage type = "other">$1,500</damage> for "blasted rock for retaining the driveway". The total, with tax, was <damage type = "other">$9,146.82</damage>. In June 2009, the plaintiffs paid Mr. Marty Fyfe <damage type = "other">$1,086.75</damage> to raise the pond further. Finally, in June 2010, the plaintiffs paid Malahat Landscape <damage type = "other">$2,160</damage> to raise the pond even further. There was also a charge of <damage type = "other">$3,200</damage> for "crushed rock to repair driveway including trucking", which brought the amount paid to Malahat Landscape to <damage type = "other">$5,628</damage>. In total the plaintiffs paid <damage type = "other">$15,861.57</damage> to have the size of the Pond increased. In my opinion most of those expenses were incurred as a direct result of Pro Star's negligent advice and its breach of the implied term of the Contract regarding the proper depth and size of the Pond. I am not, however, convinced that the expenses associated with "blasted rock" or "crushed rock" are sufficiently linked to Pro Star's actions or advice so as to render them consequential damages. I find the plaintiffs are entitled to <damage type = "general">$11,200.00</damage> from Pro Star.
61  The GXS Pro Star supplied to the plaintiffs was defective and it never performed to the level it was supposed to. In my opinion, the plaintiffs were justified in retaining Mercury to design and install a new GXS. The cost associated with the new PHX was approximately <damage type = "other">$8,475.00</damage>. Although Trane supplied the plaintiffs with a new heat pump, free of charge, Mercury charged the plaintiffs $7,175.00 to install it and connect it to the PHX. In my view these costs are compensable damages as consequential losses resulting directly from the actions and negligence of Pro Star.
62  The plaintiffs further assert that they incurred the following costs on account of Pro Star's breach of the Contract and negligence:
<damage type = "other">$144.48</damage> to Tower Fence Products Ltd., for galvanized tension wire and aluminium ties;
<damage type = "other">$874.72</damage> to Draycore Construction Ltd., for the supply of rock for the plaintiffs' driveway;
<damage type = "other">$2,284.80</damage> to Ed Brennan Excavating Ltd., for the excavation of the trench from the plaintiffs' house to the PHX;
<damage type = "other">$1,3010.40</damage> to Ed Brennan Excavating Ltd., for repairs to the plaintiffs' driveway;
<damage type = "other">$20.37</damage> to Pro Star for air filters for the heat pump;
<damage type = "other">$616.00</damage> to Amerispec Inspection Services for "EcoEnergy audits" of the plaintiffs' home.
63  Except for the costs associated with excavating the trench between the plaintiffs' house and the PHX, I agree with Pro Star that the plaintiffs have failed to prove the other expenses were directly associated or as a consequence of Pro Star's breach of contract or negligence. As such, the plaintiffs are entitled to the $2,285.00 they paid to Ed Brennan Excavating Ltd.
Non-Pecuniary Damages for Breach of Contract
64  In addition to the other relief sought in this action, the plaintiffs seek an award of non-pecuniary damages for the emotional distress and the loss of enjoyment of life they have suffered as a result of Pro Star's breach of the Contract.
65  In Wharton v. Tom Harris Chevrolet Oldsmobile Cadillac Ltd.,  the Court of Appeal upheld an award of <damage type = "other">$5,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages for the plaintiff's mental distress and inconvenience as a result of the defendant's failure over a period of two-and-a-half years to fix the audio system in a luxury vehicle it had sold to the plaintiff. Writing for the majority of the court, Madam Justice Levine explained:
[4] ... The problem caused by the sound system breached the statutory warranty provided by s. 18(a) of the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 410, that the automobile was reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was purchased. Non-pecuniary damages (of a modest amount) for mental distress (including anxiety, frustration and inconvenience) caused by the breach of warranty of fitness are recoverable "when the subject-matter of the contract is to provide peace of mind or freedom from distress" (Warrington v. Great-West Life Assurance Co.  (B.C.C.A.) at para. 19 per Newbury J.A.), and for "physical inconvenience and discomfort caused by the breach and mental suffering directly related to that inconvenience and discomfort" (Farley v. Skinner, [2001] 3 W.L.R. 899, [2001] H.L.J. No. 49 (H.L.) at paras. 14-16). In my view, both of these conditions apply in this case. The appellant did not raise the matter of mitigation at trial or accept the trial judge's invitation to make submissions on costs. In my view, it is too late to raise these issues on this appeal.
66  At para. 57 in Wharton, Justice Levine reviewed the jurisprudence on the awarding of non-pecuniary damages where there has been an breach of contract and neatly summarized the legal principles as follows:
[57] The reasons for judgment in Farley provide a summary and survey of the law as it has developed, in England, to date. They are helpful in analyzing and summarizing the principles derived from Watts, which are, in my view, applicable to the case at bar. In summary they are (borrowing the language from both Watts and Farley):
A contract-breaker is not in general liable for any distress, frustration, anxiety, displeasure, vexation, tension, or aggravation which the breach of contract may cause to the innocent party.
The rule is not absolute. Where a major or important part of the contract is to give pleasure, relaxation or peace of mind, damages will be awarded if the fruit of the contract is not provided or if the contrary result is instead procured.
In cases not falling within the "peace of mind" category, damages are recoverable for inconvenience and discomfort caused by the breach and the mental suffering directly related to that inconvenience and discomfort. However, the cause of the inconvenience or discomfort must be a sensory experience as opposed to mere disappointment that the contract has been broken. If those effects are foreseeably suffered during a period when defects are repaired, they sound in damages even though the cost of repairs is not recoverable as such.
67  In Fidler v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, , the Supreme Court of Canada addressed the issue of awarding damages for mental distress in cases where there has been a breach of contract. At paras. 44-45, the court opined:
[44] We conclude that damages for mental distress for breach of contract may, in appropriate cases, be awarded as an application of the principle in Hadley v. Baxendale: see Vorvis, . The court should ask "what did the contract promise?" and provide compensation for those promises. The aim of compensatory damages is to restore the wronged party to the position he or she would have been in had the contract not been broken. As the Privy Council stated in Wertheim v. 44 Chicoutimi Pulp Co., , at p. 307: "the party complaining should, so far as it can be done by money, be placed in the same position as he would have been in if the contract had been performed". The measure of these damages is, of course, subject to remoteness principles. There is no reason why this should not include damages for mental distress, where such damages were in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made. This conclusion follows from the basic principle of compensatory contractual damages: that the parties are to be restored to the position they contracted for, whether tangible or intangible. The law's task is simply to provide the benefits contracted for, whatever their nature, if they were in the reasonable contemplation of the parties.
[45] It does not follow, however, that all mental distress associated with a breach of contract is compensable. In normal commercial contracts, the likelihood of a breach of contract causing mental distress is not ordinarily within the reasonable contemplation of the parties. It is not unusual that a breach of contract will leave the wronged party feeling frustrated or angry. The law does not award damages for such incidental frustration. The matter is otherwise, however, when the parties enter into a contract, an object of which is to secure a particular psychological benefit. In such a case, damages arising from such mental distress should in principle be recoverable where they are established on the evidence and shown to have been within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made. The basic principles of contract damages do not cease to operate merely because what is promised is an intangible, like mental security.
68  The plaintiffs were building their family dream-home. They wished to set a good example for their children and consequently they were diligent in their efforts to ensure their home was built using environmentally sensitive methods. They contracted with and relied on Pro Star to provide them with a properly functioning GXS that would be energy efficient and effective at ensuring the temperature in their home remained at a steady and comfortable level. Instead of having a peaceful and comfortably warmed and cooled home by means of an energy conserving environmentally-friendly GXS, the plaintiffs embarked upon a three-year odyssey of hit and miss attempts by Pro Star to remedy what was clearly a defective GXS. The plaintiffs endured three winters of ineffective home heating and increased hydroelectric bills. Their use and enjoyment of their home was diminished during this time because of the noise, vibration and continuing malfunctions of the heat pump. It was only after the entire GXS was replaced by a company other than Pro Star that the plaintiffs' home began to be heated and cooled properly. In my respectful opinion, the Contract falls into the "peace of mind" category explained in Wharton.
69  In arriving at the quantum of non-pecuniary damages for the plaintiffs, I have kept in mind Justice Levine's words of caution at para. 63 in Wharton that an award of damages for mental distress from a breach of contract should be "restrained and modest".
70  In Kaira v. Nelson, , the court awarded the plaintiffs <damage type = "other">$25,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages for the loss of enjoyment of their home and the permanent diminution of its value following the defendant home inspector's failure to identify a permanent defect in the home prior to the plaintiffs purchasing it.
71  In Commercial Electronics Ltd. v. Savics, , the court awarded <damage type = "other">$10,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages against an electronics company that had breached its contract with a property owner when it failed to install a properly functioning deluxe entertainment centre in the owner's home.
72  The plaintiffs argue that the amount of distress and aggravation they had to endure over a period of three years warrants an award of non-pecuniary damages of between <damage type = "other">$30,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$35,000</damage>.
73  For its part, Pro Star asserts that it worked diligently for over three years to determine the problem or problems with the Chamberlain GXS and did so without charging the plaintiffs for its work. As such, Pro Star maintains there are no grounds to award the plaintiffs any non-pecuniary damages.
74  I accept that Pro Star made a genuine attempt to resolve the puzzling troubles with the GXS it had designed and sold to the plaintiffs. Be that as it may, the stress on the Chamberlain family in having to live in a new home that was not properly heated and that had a continually malfunctioning heat pump was real and it resulted in a serious strain on the plaintiffs' marriage. While it has taken a significant amount of time, effort and expense to get a properly functioning GXS, the plaintiffs now have one, and therefore I do not find their situation to be as egregious as the one in Kaira. It is, on the other hand, more pronounced than the inconvenience and distress described in Wharton. In my view, considering all of the circumstances of this case, an appropriate award of non-pecuniary damages is <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$15,000</damage>.
Conclusion
75  At the outset of these reasons, I identified the three principal questions that needed to be answered in this litigation. In my opinion, the evidence supports the plaintiffs' claims that Pro Star breached the Contract and was negligent when it designed, installed and repeatedly attempted to repair a GXS that never did perform as required. I find the plaintiffs have suffered damages on account of Pro Star's acts or omissions and, therefore, I make the following award:
<damage type = "general">$29,535</damage> in damages for the losses and expenses consequential to Pro Star's negligence and breach of contract;
<damage type = "non-pecuniary">$15,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages for the mental distress and loss of enjoyment of life caused by Pro Star's breach of contract.
76  If there is a need to address the issue of costs, then the parties may schedule a hearing for that purpose within 30 days of the date of this judgment. Otherwise, as the plaintiffs have been successful in this action, they are entitled to their ordinary costs.

Action by the plaintiff for damages for injuries arising from a motor vehicle accident. The parties were driving in opposite directions on a major thoroughfare. Their vehicles collided while the defendant was making a left turn. Each party blamed the other. The plaintiff suffered soft tissue injuries that resulted in chronic back pain and neck and shoulder pain. He was 26, with a Grade 10 education, and had a history of jobs involving physical labour. He continued to be employed. 

HELD: Action allowed.
 The defendant was solely responsible for the accident. The plaintiff's vehicle was an immediate hazard when the defendant began her turn. The defendant did not have a clear view of the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff was not speeding, having started from a dead stop at the previous intersection, and there was no basis upon which to assert that he was driving without due care and attention. The plaintiff was a more reliable witness as to the events leading up to the accident. The plaintiff's injuries were caused by the accident. The plaintiff was awarded <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$80,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages, <damage type = "future wage loss">$250,000</damage> for loss of future earning capacity, <damage type = "future care">$10,000</damage> for the cost of future care and <damage type = "special">$1721</damage> in special damages. The plaintiff had constant back pain, which was at times severe; persistent numbness in his left leg on a regular basis; and neck and shoulder pain that largely resolved within a year, although it continued to flare up approximately once per week. His condition was chronic. It mostly impacted his working life, but also his personal life. He established a real and substantial possibility of a future event that would lead to an income loss. He was extremely limited in his career options. He had to rely on his physical strength to make a living. To the extent that his physical abilities were compromised, there was an issue as to whether he would be able to work at labour-intensive jobs into the future. Retraining was not a realistic option, given his limited education. The capital approach to quantifying damages was appropriate, given his young age, his present employment and the uncertainties arising from his future career path. His work ethic suggested that he would continue to work through the pain, but the reality was that employers looked for healthy employees.

Introduction
1  The plaintiff, Christopher Andrusko, was involved in a motor vehicle accident on January 3, 2008 in Fort St. John. His vehicle collided with the vehicle driven by the defendant, Alison Alexander, and owned by her husband, the defendant Lee Hickman. Both were driving on a wintry afternoon and approaching each other from opposite directions on the same street. Mr. Andrusko hit Ms. Alexander's car while she was trying to make a left-hand turn.
2  Both parties blame the accident on the other, so liability or degrees of liability are in issue.
3  Mr. Andrusko claims injuries arising from the accident relating to his neck, left shoulder, leg and low back. The low back pain is said now to be chronic. He claims non-pecuniary losses, loss of earning capacity, cost of future care, and special damages.
4  Therefore, the issues for determination are:
Who is liable for the accident?
If liability on the part of the defendants is established, what are the proper damages to be assessed?
The Facts
Prior to the Accident
5  Mr. Andrusko is currently 26 years old. He has limited education, having only completed Grade 10.
6  Since he left school at the age of 16 years, he has had a number of jobs, mostly involving physical labour. He started as a fry cook at Kentucky Fried Chicken. From 2002 to <damage type = "other">2004</damage>, he was employed in Edmonton, Alberta as a labourer doing basic carpentry work. From <damage type = "other">2004</damage> to <damage type = "other">2006</damage>, he was employed in Gibsons, B.C. as a car detailer, which job involved cleaning and washing cars.
7  He returned to Fort St. John in <damage type = "other">2006</damage> and obtained employment at Joy Propane earning <damage type = "other">$16</damage> per hour. Joy Propane does some bulk sales of propane, but it is largely a retail supplier of fuel. It conducts its business in two areas. Firstly, it operates a commercial side where commercial vehicles will pull up and load the propane. In addition, customers will come and fill up the normal type of cylinders that you see on barbecues. Secondly, there is a vehicle division where a fuel attendant will fill up a vehicle just as you would normally do at a gas station.
8  Mr. Andrusko was a fuel attendant and labourer. He worked on both sides of the business. As part of the commercial side, he was involved in pumping fuel and dealing with all types and sizes of propane tanks, from small 20 pound ones for the barbecue going up to 100 pound tanks for commercial purposes. When full, these tanks would be almost double the weight as when empty. Thus, dealing with these tanks required physical effort. There was less physical effort required while working on the vehicle side of the business.
9  Mr. Andrusko was employed by Joy Propane at the time of the accident. His boss, Steven Stanway, described Mr. Andrusko as a reliable and hard worker. He also described an incident involving Mr. Andrusko that caused him to conclude that Mr. Andrusko was honest and forthright. Mr. Stanway indicates that prior to the accident, Mr. Andrusko had no difficulty in completing his duties.
10  Mr. Andrusko has been in a long-term relationship with Jody Stroud for about eight years. She is also 26 years old and employed as a receptionist. They met in 2004 and began living together shortly thereafter. They currently live in Fort St. John, and at the time of the trial, they were engaged to be married in the spring of 2013.
11  Mr. Andrusko described himself as having no difficulty in completing his physically demanding jobs prior to the accident. In particular, he says that he had no neck, shoulder or low back pain. This evidence is confirmed by Ms. Stroud, who also said that Mr. Andrusko was in good health. She did not observe any neck, left shoulder or low back pain, or any numbness in his left leg before the accident.
12  Although Mr. Andrusko was involved in a motor vehicle accident in 2003, there were no injuries to his neck and back in that accident.
The Accident
13  100th Street in Fort St. John is a major thoroughfare. It has two lanes of travel in both the north and southbound directions. It also has parking lanes on each side. The cross streets are Avenues similarly numbered such that the numbers increase as you move northbound. There is no traffic light at the intersection of 100th Street and 102nd Avenue where the accident occurred.
14  The accident occurred a little after 4 p.m. on January 3, 2008. Dusk was approaching and it was a snowy day in Fort St. John. The roads were slippery and covered in compact snow.
15  Mr. Andrusko was 21 years old at the time of the accident. He had borrowed Ms. Stroud's 1990 Chevrolet Cavalier to go to work. He had left his job at Joy Propane around 4 p.m. and was driving to the Tim Horton's to get Ms. Stroud a coffee. He was wearing his seatbelt. He denies that he was tired after a day at work or that he was in a hurry to get to Tim Horton's. He turned onto 100th Street around 93rd Avenue and was proceeding northbound on 100th Street in the lane nearest to the centre line. At the stop light at 101st Avenue, Mr. Andrusko stopped at a red light and was first in line with no cars ahead of him. Accordingly, he had a clear unobstructed view along 100th Street. He then proceeded on the next green light, approaching the intersection at 102nd Avenue. He was familiar with the intersection, having driven it many times.
16  At the same time, Ms. Alexander was driving southbound on 100th Street in a 1995 Dodge Neon owned by her spouse, Mr. Hickman. She was approaching the intersection at 102nd Avenue, where she intended to make a left turn. She was also in the lane of travel nearest to the centre line.
17  From this time forward, the evidence from Mr. Andrusko and Ms. Alexander widely differs.
18  What is uncontroversial, however, is that Mr. Andrusko's vehicle struck the right back passenger side of Ms. Alexander's vehicle with the front right passenger side of his vehicle as Ms. Alexander attempted her left hand turn in front of Mr. Andrusko. Ms. Alexander's vehicle spun and ended up facing west on 102nd Avenue, the opposite direction from her path of travel. Mr. Andrusko also veered off and spun around, coming to a stop in the lane of oncoming southbound traffic about three to four car lengths beyond the intersection. He managed to pull the vehicle back into the northbound lane and then parked further up on 100th Street.
19  Mr. Andrusko described the impact as "pretty severe". Both of the airbags in Mr. Andrusko's vehicle deployed. His vehicle sustained damage at the front passenger side estimated at a value of <damage type = "other">$4,227.93</damage>, causing ICBC to write it off.
After the Accident
20  Immediately after the accident, Mr. Andrusko was attended to by paramedics, but he declined to receive medical treatment at the time. The paramedics did notice a seatbelt line on Mr. Andrusko, presumably from the impact, and they suggested that he would probably be sore. A paramedic recommended that he visit the emergency room at the hospital. Mr. Andrusko did not do so, although he says that his neck, left shoulder and back started to bother him.
21  The RCMP also attended the scene, and Mr. Andrusko gave the police a statement. No traffic infractions were ticketed as a result of the accident.
22  After giving his statement, Mr. Andrusko found a camera in his car and went about taking various pictures of the vehicles. He also cleaned out his car while waiting for his friend, Josh Woods, to pick him up. Immediately afterwards, Mr. Andrusko and Mr. Woods went to Wal-Mart to get the photographs developed. He then went home.
23  Over the next few days, Mr. Andrusko had a sore and stiff neck and left shoulder. After a day or two, he started to feel lower back pain. Again, this evidence was confirmed by Ms. Stroud, who observed him experiencing pain in his neck, shoulder, low back and left leg. Ms. Stroud also observed that the neck and left shoulder pain would come at the same time, as would the low back pain and left leg numbness.
24  Mr. Andrusko went to a walk-in clinic in the first few days after the accident and saw Dr. Brussow. Later, he would see his family doctor, Dr. Van Zyl. Dr. Van Zyl prescribed various medications, including sleeping pills, muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory drugs. He began taking this prescription medication in January 2008 and continues to take this medication as needed to this day.
25  Mr. Andrusko has tried certain treatments over the years to address his injuries. Shortly after the accident, beginning on January 11, 2008, he started to see a chiropractor at North Peace Chiropractic. He regularly saw a chiropractor during 2008 and into early 2009. He obtained some relief but found that the pain returned about a week later.
26  After being disappointed with the results from the chiropractor, Mr. Andrusko was referred by Dr. Van Zyl to a physiotherapist for treatment. He began treatment at Fort St. John Physio Clinic on January 30, 2009 and regularly saw a physiotherapist during 2009 (eleven visits), 2010 (three visits), 2011 (four visits), and 2012 (three visits). He was continuing to see a physiotherapist at the time of trial.
27  Mr. Andrusko also tried massage therapy one time in August 2008 but decided that it did not assist him.
28  Fortunately, Mr. Andrusko only missed one day off work. He returned to his job at Joy Propane, although he was put on lighter duties on the vehicle side. He did, from time to time, lift 20 or 30 pound tanks after that time, but he was no longer involved in lifting the larger 100 pound (when empty) tanks as he had previously done. His new duties involved filling propane tanks in vehicles, which required some bending and turning for smaller cars. Generally, these lighter duties did not stress his lower back. Nevertheless, he still indicated that his back was irritated and would bother him from time to time as a result of his job at Joy Propane.
29  In March 2009, Mr. Andrusko was let go from Joy Propane for fighting with a customer. He then obtained a temporary job as a labourer for about a month.
30  Later, in 2009, he obtained a job at H2Oasis as a delivery driver and bottle washer. He indicates that his job involved twisting, turning and bending, so his back was irritated again. As part of his job, he was required to work with five gallon tanks of water. He left his job at H2Oasis after a change in management and after an issue developed with his employer about a repair bill.
31  In the summer of 2010, Mr. Andrusko obtained a labourer position at DGS Astro Paving ("DGS"). His friend, Jeffrey Higgins, who was working as a foreman there, got him the job. DGS is involved in the construction of roads, parking lots and driveways. This is a seasonal job which requires a rigorous schedule from the spring (April/May) to the time the snow flies (usually November). Mr. Andrusko was required to work 12 to 16 hour days about six to seven days a week. Many of his initial duties included very physical work, including working with heavy materials and manual shovelling. In addition, he operated various pieces of equipment.
32  Mr. Higgins was aware of Mr. Andrusko's low back problems when he was hired at DGS. He gave Mr. Andrusko certain lighter duties as a worker in his crew, but he did not play favourites. Mr. Higgins confirmed that Mr. Andrusko would complain about his back from time to time, although he did not consider Mr. Andrusko to be a complainer.
33  Mr. Andrusko was later promoted to the position of lead hand at DGS in early 2011, which resulted in him doing less labour work and more supervisory work.
34  Mr. Andrusko says that often his neck, shoulder and low back will bother him after work at DGS such that he has to medicate with muscle relaxants when he gets home. He often experiences pain when running equipment that requires him to look behind. When this happens, his shoulder and neck stiffen up and he gets intermittent pain. This happens more frequently by the end of the working season, but it improves over the winter months when he collects employment insurance.
35  Mr. Andrusko continued with his seasonal job at DGS for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. In November 2012, at the end of this season, he obtained a temporary job for about two weeks at Haycove Contracting, where he did snow removal using a bobcat. He indicates that his back bothered him while operating the bobcat.
36  At the time of the trial, Mr. Andrusko had applied for employment insurance and was waiting to hear back from the government. In the meantime, Mr. Andrusko was also studying to get his Class 3 driver's license.
37  Mr. Andrusko's evidence is that he has continued with his employment duties since the accident, but that he has had pain and numbness since that time. His evidence is corroborated by that of Ms. Stroud, who observed him coming home from work at Joy Propane, H2Oasis and DGS in pain from completing his duties. Ms. Stroud also confirmed that his pain was more severe at the end of the season with DGS. She said that the pain was severe at least once a week. She also confirmed that while his injuries have improved since the accident, the level of those injuries has stayed the same for the last two years.
38  Mr. Andrusko's injuries have affected his day-to-day activities. He appears to have help doing the more physical chores at their home, including snow shovelling and lawn mowing. On long drives, he experiences pain and has to stop and stretch to alleviate the pain. He cannot sit long to play video games or work in his music studio. He also has trouble starting the lawnmower. Finally, he is more irritable and cranky in his relationship with Ms. Stroud.
39  In terms of the duration of his injuries, Mr. Andrusko indicates that his neck and shoulder bother him at least twice a week. He indicates that his neck and shoulder are staying the same at this point in time.
40  Mr. Andrusko's complaints about his lower back are more serious. He says that he has low back pain or soreness just below his beltline every day. Some days are worse than others when he experiences sharp pain. He has also had some numbness in his left leg since the accident, which is present all the time. Twisting and bending aggravates the pain. He indicates that on a bad day, about once or twice per week, the pain is 10 out of 10. On average, he rates his pain as 6/7 out of 10. He tries to use sleeping pills, muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatories when the pain is too bad, but he finds that they can make him very drowsy. He says that he cannot function at work when he is drowsy, and given his line of work, he understandably has safety concerns if he is less than alert.
41  Mr. Andrusko does not use any aid for his injuries. He did buy a back belt, but he was advised some years ago not to use it. Although he is not an avid exerciser, he regularly completes exercises for his core and his left leg about three times a week in his home.
42  Mr. Andrusko is also an avid music lover. In 2009, he started a small business named "Too Die for Recordz", in which he operates as a mobile disc jockey for small events. He also constructed his own music studio, where he likes to make, mix, record and produce music. He has invested quite a sum of money purchasing equipment for this venture, although his gross profit from this venture has been nominal: 2009 - <damage type = "other">$4,242</damage>; 2010 - <damage type = "other">$1,085</damage>; and 2011 - <damage type = "other">$1,008</damage>. He describes this more as a hobby, which is evident when he calculates his net income losses for these years.
43  Mr. Andrusko spends considerable time working on his music business, particularly during the off-season from his job at DGS. He can work for eight to ten hours a day up to seven days a week. While he was questioned regarding his ability to sit for so long, he indicated that he was able to get up and move around to alleviate the pain caused by sitting for prolonged periods of time.
44  Mr. Andrusko is very interested in developing his music business to the point of making more money. He has not taken any music engineering courses, nor does he have any plans to do so. He describes himself as more self-taught.
45  Mr. Andrusko is fairly uncertain about his future. He currently plans to continue to live in Fort St. John and stay in the employ of DGS where he makes what he calls "good money" (about <damage type = "other">$52,000</damage> per year). He may apply to be a foreman at DGS in the future. He wants to try to get his Class 3 driver's license, which would allow him to operate larger trucks.
46  He is not sure how he could continue with either his present position or as a truck driver if his low back condition worsened, given the physical requirements of both jobs. He does not see a sedentary office job in his future given his educational limitations. In addition, given his somewhat prickly personality, he quite candidly admits that he would prefer not working in a job where he would have to deal with the public.
Credibility and Reliability of Evidence
47  Credibility arose on two points: firstly, the evidence of Mr. Andrusko and Ms. Alexander in respect of liability; and secondly, Mr. Andrusko's evidence on the damage issues.
48  The factors to be considered when assessing credibility were summarized by Dillon J. in Bradshaw v. Stenner, :
[186] Credibility involves an assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness' testimony based upon the veracity or sincerity of a witness and the accuracy of the evidence that the witness provides (Raymond v. Bosanquet (Township) ,  (S.C.C.)). The art of assessment involves examination of various factors such as the ability and opportunity to observe events, the firmness of his memory, the ability to resist the influence of interest to modify his recollection, whether the witness' evidence harmonizes with independent evidence that has been accepted, whether the witness changes his testimony during direct and cross-examination, whether the witness' testimony seems unreasonable, impossible, or unlikely, whether a witness has a motive to lie, and the demeanour of a witness generally (Wallace v. Davis,  (Ont. H.C.); Faryna v. Chorny,  (B.C.C.A.) [Faryna ]; R. v. S.(R.D.),  at para.128 (S.C.C.)). Ultimately, the validity of the evidence depends on whether the evidence is consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole and shown to be in existence at the time (Faryna at para. 356).
49  If the plaintiff's account of his or her change in physical, mental, or emotional state as a result of the accident is not convincing, then the hypothesis upon which any expert opinions rest will be undermined: Samuel v. Chrysler Credit Canada Ltd.,  at paras. 15, 49-50.
50  I will address the credibility issues below.
Liability
The Parties' Positions
51  As stated above, Mr. Andrusko was driving along 100th Street after the light had turned green at the intersection of 101st Avenue. Mr. Andrusko estimated his speed at 35-40 km/hour although he was not particularly sure of his speed. He indicated in his evidence that he was driving at an appropriate speed and definitely below the speed limit of 50 km/hour.
52  As he was proceeding toward 102nd Avenue, he noticed Ms. Alexander coming into the intersection and that her car started to slide. He could not say for sure whether he saw a turn signal on her car, but he said that this left turn by Ms. Alexander was unexpected and that it occurred just before the crosswalk as he was entering the intersection. He estimated that he was only a car or one-and-a-half car lengths away when she started to turn into the intersection. Mr. Andrusko said that he applied the brakes, but they locked up and he hit her vehicle on the back of the passenger side.
53  There is a significant divergence in the parties' evidence about how the accident happened, and in particular, what other vehicles or pedestrians were involved.
54  Ms. Alexander is 55 years old and lives in Fort St. John with Mr. Hickman. She has lived there for 23 years and she is very familiar with the intersection. She says that she was returning home from the bank. She confirmed Mr. Andrusko's evidence about the weather, in that it was overcast and the roads were snow-covered and icy underneath.
55  Ms. Alexander's evidence is that she turned right onto 100th Street at 106th Avenue, pulling into the right lane (beside the curb) and proceeding south down the street. At about 3/4 of a block before 102nd Avenue, she moved into the left lane so that she could turn left onto 102nd Avenue. At about the same time, she put her left turn signal on. She says that she was travelling behind an SUV, which eventually slowed and stopped just into the intersection. She stopped behind the SUV. From there she says that she observed a vehicle stopped in the northbound curb lane. She also says that she saw a woman stopped and standing on the far corner near to where the northbound vehicle was stopped. She waited to turn onto 102nd Avenue. She says that she looked around the SUV and did not see anything coming. In her words, she said that she had room to move around the SUV, so she proceeded to turn left. As she pulled out, she saw Mr. Andrusko's vehicle coming toward the intersection. She tried to get out of his way; as she put it, she "stepped on" the gas to accelerate her vehicle out of the way. She estimates that she was in the middle of the intersection when the collision occurred.
56  Mr. Andrusko says that there was no SUV in the southbound lane, as Ms. Alexander suggests, or any pedestrian standing on the street corner. Further, he does not recall any vehicle alongside his vehicle going northbound.
57  After the collision, Mr. Andrusko got out of his vehicle and ran over to see if Ms. Alexander was all right. He said that she was getting hysterical and that she insinuated that he was speeding and to blame for the accident. Mr. Andrusko said that he replied that she had made an illegal turn in front of him. Ms. Alexander says that Mr. Andrusko said that he was sorry and that he was going too fast, which he denies. She denies that she said anything to him.
58  Ms. Alexander also says that right after the accident, a woman came up to her and said something to the effect, "if you need a witness, you can call me". She says that this woman gave her a business card. On cross-examination, Ms. Alexander said that this woman was the driver of the vehicle stopped just before the intersection in the northbound lane of travel. She put the card in her pocket. Ms. Alexander does not recall or did not relate the specifics of this conversation later in her conversation with Constable Grainger of the RCMP, but she does say that she gave him the business card and that he later returned it to her. She then put it back in her coat pocket. She has no idea what happened to that business card. She never looked at it, so she has no idea what it said.
59  Ms. Alexander's husband picked her up, as her car was not driveable. She was stiff and sore the next day with some bruising, although she did not seek any medical treatment.
60  Constable Grainger attended at the scene shortly after the accident. He interviewed both Mr. Andrusko and Ms. Alexander. It is notable that the Constable's records, including the near contemporaneous notes taken just after the accident and the interviews, confirm what Ms. Alexander told him about the accident. He says that Ms. Alexander informed him that she was making a left turn onto 102nd Avenue when she was struck by Mr. Andrusko's vehicle. She made no mention of Mr. Andrusko allegedly speeding into the intersection. Nor did she mention anything about a pedestrian stopped on the corner or any other vehicles stopped at the intersection at the time. Finally, the Constable had no recollection or note of Ms. Alexander having given him a business card of a witness. His Occurrence Report, which was provided to the parties, indicates that no witnesses were "carded". He indicates that if he had been so informed, that person or witness would have been contacted.
61  Constable Grainger filled in his report while in his police cruiser immediately after he had interviewed the parties and cleared the scene. While he indicated during cross-examination that it is possible that he misplaced this business card, I believe it is unlikely. The Constable was the most objective and calm person on the scene and clearly would have recognized the need to identify a witness to the accident as an important detail of his investigation, particularly if Ms. Alexander had made a point of giving this card to him. Ms. Alexander was in shock and by her own admission, not thinking straight.
62  I find that Ms. Alexander's evidence concerning this card is confusing and suspect. I find as a fact that even if Ms. Alexander had received a card from someone at the scene, she did not give it to Constable Grainger.
63  Constable Grainger indicated that if he can form an opinion of fault arising from his investigation at the accident, he would do so. His report indicates that "Alexander failed to yield the right of way to Andrusko in this collision".
The Law
64  The Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 318 addresses the rules of the road while making left hand turns:
Yielding right of way on left turn
174 When a vehicle is in an intersection and its driver intends to turn left, the driver must yield the right of way to traffic approaching from the opposite direction that is in the intersection or so close as to constitute an immediate hazard, but having yielded and given a signal as required by sections 171 and 172, the driver may turn the vehicle to the left, and traffic approaching the intersection from the opposite direction must yield the right of way to the vehicle making the left turn.
65  The leading decision on assigning liability arising from a collision where a vehicle is exercising a right of way and the other vehicle does not yield is found in Walker v. Brownlee,  at 461 (S.C.C.). There, Cartwright J. stated:
While the decision of every motor vehicle collision case must depend on its particular facts, I am of opinion that when A, the driver in the servient position, proceeds through an intersection in complete disregard of his statutory duty to yield the right-of-way and a collision results, if he seeks to cast any portion of the blame upon B, the driver having the right-of-way, A must establish that after B became aware, or by the exercise of reasonable care should have become aware, of A's disregard of the law B had in fact a sufficient opportunity to avoid the accident of which a reasonably careful and skilful driver would have availed himself; and I do not think that in such circumstances any doubts should be resolved in favour of A, whose unlawful conduct was fons et origo mali.
66  The test from Walker was followed in Pacheco (Guardian ad litem of) v. Robinson  (C.A.). In that case, a plaintiff cyclist had entered the intersection and then the defendant commenced a left-hand turn with her vehicle. The trial judge found that the defendant had failed to yield the right of way and that the plaintiff cyclist was "obviously and clearly so close so as to constitute an immediate hazard". The Court of Appeal overturned the trial judge's finding that the cyclist was contributorily negligent. The Court, adopting the comments in Walker above, stated:
[10] ...A defendant who wishes to make a left hand turn in an intersection has an obligation to yield to oncoming traffic which is in the intersection under the provision of s. 176 of the Motor Vehicle Act.
[11] The plaintiff was not bound to guard against every conceivable eventuality but only against such eventualities as a reasonable person ought to have foreseen as being within the ordinary range of human experience. The plaintiff was entitled to proceed on the assumption that all other vehicles will do what it is their duty to do, namely observe the rules regulating traffic.
...
[15] In my opinion, a driver who wishes to make a left hand turn at an intersection has an obligation not to proceed unless it can be done safely. Where each party's vision of the other is blocked by traffic, the dominant driver who is proceeding through the intersection is generally entitled to continue and the servient left-turning driver must yield the right of way. The existence of a left-turning vehicle does not raise a presumption that something unexpected might happen and cast a duty on the dominant driver to take extra care. Where the defendant, as here, has totally failed to determine whether a turn can be made safely, the defendant should be held 100 percent at fault for a collision which occurs.
...
[18] In my opinion, when a driver in a servient position disregards his statutory duty to yield the right of way and a collision results, then to fix any blame on the dominant driver, the servient driver must establish that after the dominant driver became aware, or by the exercise of reasonable care should have become aware, of the servient driver's own disregard of the law, the dominant driver had a sufficient opportunity to avoid the accident of which a reasonably careful and skilful driver would have availed himself. In such circumstance any doubt should be resolved in favour of the dominant driver. ...
67  The principles from the above cases were recently affirmed in Nerval v. Kehra, . Harris J.A. found that the analysis begins with determining whether the left-turning driver has satisfied the onus of proving that the oncoming vehicle was not an "immediate hazard":
[33] The principles laid down in Pacheco lead to the conclusion that the starting point of the analysis is that when a left turning driver is assessing making a left turn in an intersection he or she must yield the right of way to oncoming traffic unless it is not an immediate hazard. Describing a driver as dominant means no more than that driver has the right of way, whereas the servient driver has the obligation to yield the right of way. The obligation imposed by s. 174 on the left turning vehicle is that it "must yield the right of way to traffic approaching from the opposite direction that is in the intersection or so close as to constitute an immediate hazard". A left turn must not be commenced unless it is clearly safe to do so. If there are no vehicles in the intersection or sufficiently close to be an imminent hazard, the driver may turn left and approaching traffic must yield the right of way. In other words, if a left turning driver complies with his or her obligation only to start the left turn when no other vehicles are in the intersection or constitute an immediate hazard, then the left turning driver assumes the relationship of being the dominant vehicle and approaching vehicles become servient and must yield the right of way.
[34] As observed in Salaam v. Abramovic,  at para. 33, the words "immediate hazard" are "used to determine when a vehicle may lawfully enter an intersection. They determine who is the dominant driver, but do not, by themselves, define the standard of care in a negligence action."
[35] The effect of s. 174 is to cast the burden of proving the absence of an immediate hazard at the moment the left turn begins onto the left turning driver. This result flows inevitably from the wording of the section itself, given the nature of the absolute obligation the section creates. If a left turning driver, in the face of this statutory obligation, asserts that he or she started to turn left when it was safe to do so, then the burden of proving that fact rests with them.
[Emphasis added.]
68  The evidence clearly indicates that Mr. Andrusko's vehicle was an immediate hazard when Ms. Alexander began her left-hand turn. As the court notes in Nerval at para. 43, this determination is largely a function of speed and distance from the intersection. Mr. Andrusko's evidence was that Ms. Alexander turned unexpectedly in front of him and that she was only a short distance away when she began her turn.
69  Ms. Alexander does not seriously suggest otherwise and concedes, at least in part, that she was to blame for the accident. She did not see Mr. Andrusko's car until she began her turn and it was too late by that time to stop and avoid the collision. On cross-examination, Ms. Alexander said that she was stopped behind the SUV and had room to move around it and attempt the left turn. Only when she was in the intersection making the turn did she first observe Mr. Andrusko. She said, "I was turning and there he was". She acknowledged that if she had seen Mr. Andrusko, she would not have turned at all.
70  I find as a fact that Ms. Alexander did not have a clear view of Mr. Andrusko's oncoming vehicle before she began to make the left-hand turn. I further find that while commencing her turn, Mr. Andrusko's vehicle constituted an "immediate hazard" in that Ms. Alexander could not complete that left-hand turn without risking a collision. As such, Ms. Alexander has not met the onus of showing that it was safe to complete the left-hand turn in these circumstances.
Contributory Negligence
71  Despite conceding some fault for the accident, Ms. Alexander asserts that Mr. Andrusko was also to blame for the collision and was therefore contributorily negligent.
72  As discussed in Nerval, this type of analysis follows after application of the "immediate hazard" test as the second aspect of determining fault for the collision:
[37] The second aspect of the burden relates to proving that despite being the dominant driver, Ms. Khehra nonetheless was negligent and at fault for causing or contributing to the accident. Here, although Ms. Khehra had the right of way, she could exercise that right only in a safe manner. The trial judge correctly relied on the statement of principle from para. 18 of Pacheco, quoted above, in assessing the evidence and reaching his conclusions.
[38] Whether a through driver is dominant turns on whether the driver's vehicle is an immediate hazard at the material time, not why it is an immediate hazard. Dominance identifies who must yield the right of way. One consequence of this analysis is that negligence on the part of a through driver does not disqualify that driver as the dominant driver. The through driver remains dominant, even though their conduct may be negligent. Indeed, the through driver's fault may be greater than the servient driver's fault. In other words, a through driver may be an immediate hazard even though that driver is speeding and given her speed would have to take sudden action to avoid the threat of a collision if the left turning driver did not yield the right of way. The correct analysis is to recognize that the through driver is breaching his or her common law and perhaps statutory obligations and to address the issue as one of apportioning fault, not to reclassify the through driver as servient based on the degree to which the through driver is in breach of her obligations. [Emphasis added.]
73  In accordance with s. 4 of the Negligence Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 333, when a plaintiff contributes negligently to causing his or her own injury, the court must determine relative degrees of fault. The correct inquiry is whether the plaintiff failed to take reasonable care for his or her own safety, and whether that failure was one of the causes of the accident: Bradley v. Bath,  at para. 27.
74  Fault or blameworthiness evaluates the parties' conduct in the circumstances, and the extent or degree to which it may be said to depart from the standard of reasonable care: Alberta Wheat Pool v. Northwest Pile,  at paras. 45-46.
75  Ms. Alexander asserts that Mr. Andrusko failed in respect of various statutory duties such that he contributed to the accident.
76  Firstly, it is alleged that Mr. Andrusko breached s. 144 of the Motor Vehicle Act by speeding and driving without due care and attention:
Careless driving prohibited
144 (1) A person must not drive a motor vehicle on a highway
without due care and attention,
without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway, or
at a speed that is excessive relative to the road, traffic, visibility or weather conditions.
77  Specifically, it is alleged that Mr. Andrusko was going too fast for the winter road conditions he faced. However, I accept the evidence of Mr. Andrusko and find as a fact that he was not speeding. He was starting from a dead stop at the previous intersection. There was also no evidentiary basis upon which to assert that Mr. Andrusko was driving without due care and attention. I find that he was aware that Ms. Alexander's vehicle was in the oncoming lane, but he was surprised when she turned in front of him unexpectedly.
78  It is also alleged that Mr. Andrusko acted negligently in not stopping or slowing at the intersection given that other vehicles and pedestrians were in and around the intersection at the time. Ms. Alexander contends that Mr. Andrusko breached his statutory obligations arising under ss. 159 and 179 of the Motor Vehicle Act:
Passing on left
159 A driver of a vehicle must not drive to the left side of the roadway in overtaking and passing another vehicle unless the driver can do so in safety.
...
Rights of way between vehicle and pedestrian
179 (1) Subject to section 180, the driver of a vehicle must yield the right of way to a pedestrian where traffic control signals are not in place or not in operation when the pedestrian is crossing the highway in a crosswalk and the pedestrian is on the half of the highway on which the vehicle is travelling, or is approaching so closely from the other half of the highway that he or she is in danger.
...
If a vehicle is slowing down or stopped at a crosswalk or at an intersection to permit a pedestrian to cross the highway, the driver of a vehicle approaching from the rear must not overtake and pass the vehicle that is slowing down or stopped.
79  This argument is largely based on Ms. Alexander's evidence, as above, that during her left-hand turn, there were two other vehicles ? the SUV in front of her and a northbound vehicle stopped at the corner. In addition, she says that she saw a pedestrian standing on the corner of the intersection near to the stopped northbound vehicle.
80  Mr. Andrusko had an entirely different recollection as to what was occurring in the intersection. He does not recall seeing any other vehicles, including both the SUV and the vehicle that Ms. Alexander says was stopped at the northbound corner in the right lane. Finally, he does not recall seeing any pedestrian on the corner.
81  Overall, in my view, Mr. Andrusko's evidence on these issues is more consistent with the probabilities affecting this case. Mr. Andrusko gave his evidence in a fair and straightforward manner and I consider that he was a credible witness. He appropriately conceded where his recollection was not clear. Overall, however, his evidence was consistent and clear. Accordingly, I found Mr. Andrusko to be a reliable witness of the events leading up to the accident.
82  In contrast, Ms. Alexander's evidence presented some difficulties relating to both before and after the accident. While I appreciate that she was doing her best to recall accurately, I consider that she failed in many material respects.
83  Ms. Alexander was clearly in some distress after the accident, indicating that she was numb and shaky. She further acknowledged that she was in shock after the accident and not thinking straight. She was very unclear on many details about the accident, including the order in which the events occurred. For example, she stated many times that she "believed" certain events had occurred. When asked about her conversations with the paramedics and police, she said it was "hard to remember".
84  Consistent with my conclusions on the reliability of Mr. Andrusko's evidence, I find that he did not admit to Ms. Alexander that he was speeding. While he says that he may have apologized for the accident in a general sense, I find that he did not acknowledge fault for the accident.
85  Ms. Alexander's story about the pedestrian and the driver of the stopped northbound car is also suspect. In her direct examination, she only said that some woman came up to her and gave her a business card. Only during cross-examination did the further detail emerge that this "witness" was, in fact, the driver of the stopped car. She then described this woman as 45 years old with short sandy hair. Given that Ms. Alexander had little, if any, recollection of speaking to Constable Grainger, however, I consider that her recollection of these further details is not accurate.
86  Given Ms. Alexander's apparent views about who was at fault for the accident at the time, obtaining a contact number for a witness would have been an important matter for her. Despite that, no business card, if one was obtained by her, materialized at the time. Even if there was a business card from a witness, I accept Constable Grainger's evidence that she did not give any business card to him. While one might excuse Ms. Alexander, since she was in shock at the time, she did not produce it even at a later time.
87  Ms. Alexander also suggested in argument that Mr. Andrusko should have stopped for the pedestrian standing on the street corner waiting to cross 100th Street. During her direct testimony, however, this did not emerge as part of her explanation for turning left or even for her thought process in thinking that she could turn safely because Mr. Andrusko would stop for that pedestrian. As stated above, she did not even see Mr. Andrusko until she had commenced her turn.
88  This story about the pedestrian being ready to cross the street only came out in cross-examination and only when Ms. Alexander was asked questions about what she had told her husband in the car on the way home after the accident.
89  These various other factors ? such as the SUV, the stopped northbound vehicle and the pedestrian ? now raised by Ms. Alexander are also noticeably missing from any later reporting on the accident and the cause of the accident by Ms. Alexander.
90  As noted above, Constable Grainger had no note of being told about any of these matters by Ms. Alexander. Further, in the ICBC claim report filed by Ms. Alexander on January 3, 2008, the same day as the accident, the adjuster noted Ms. Alexander's description of the accident. There is no mention of any other cars, including the SUV and the stopped northbound vehicle, or of a pedestrian. Nor is there any recorded note that, as she now claims, she had assumed that Mr. Andrusko would stop to allow the pedestrian to cross the street. Lastly, she did not mention to ICBC the business card of the witness that she says she obtained. While I accept that these ICBC notes are not necessarily accurate in terms of what Ms. Alexander actually reported, Ms. Alexander has little recollection of what she did say. She does acknowledge, however, that she did not relay these further facts to the ICBC adjuster. Her explanation that she was unaware that she had to tell them everything is difficult to understand since she would have known that ICBC would attempt to determine fault for the accident.
91  Lastly, the evidence does not support Ms. Alexander's description of the crosswalk and the pedestrian waiting to cross. There was no evidence at the trial about there being a crosswalk traversing 100th Street at the intersection in question. Further, even accepting that there was a pedestrian on the corner, there is no evidence that this pedestrian was trying to cross 100th Street at a crosswalk or otherwise. Ms. Alexander says that the person was just standing on the corner and had not made any movement to step into the street. This person might have been waiting to cross 102nd Avenue. Or, assuming that the stopped northbound vehicle was there, the pedestrian might have been talking to the driver of that vehicle. Lastly, if this person really was waiting to cross 100th Street, with the inside northbound vehicle already stopped, it is reasonable to assume that this pedestrian would have at least begun to venture into the street. Even on Ms. Alexander's evidence, this person did not do so.
92  I conclude that Ms. Alexander's evidence on these other matters at the intersection is not reliable. I find as a fact that, contrary to Ms. Alexander's evidence, there was no stopped northbound car in the right lane. Nor was there any pedestrian stopped on the corner waiting to cross 100th Street, whether in a crosswalk or otherwise.
93  I accept Ms. Alexander's evidence concerning the SUV proceeding in front of her southbound on 100th Street, but I find that the SUV was not stopped in the intersection. I consider it more likely that, at some point while she was proceeding down 100th Street, the SUV would have impeded her view of the oncoming vehicles, including that of Mr. Andrusko. However, I find that as or just after she was commencing her left turn, the SUV was not blocking her view and she turned or continued to turn anyway. In any event, the presence of the SUV proceeding southbound through the intersection just before Ms. Alexander turned was not a matter that would have put Mr. Andrusko on notice of anything untoward at the intersection that should have caused him to slow down or stop. His continuing through the intersection in these circumstances did not violate any statutory requirement under the Motor Vehicle Act.
94  In light of these findings, Ms. Alexander has failed to satisfy the onus upon her to establish contributory negligence on Mr. Andrusko's part, since there is no evidentiary basis for any arguments under ss. 144, 159 and 179 of the Motor Vehicle Act in relation to Mr. Andrusko's actions. In short, he did not act carelessly, there was no vehicle to pass on the left and there was no pedestrian attempting to cross 100th Street, whether in a crosswalk or otherwise. In addition, the SUV did not pose any issue. As such, Mr. Andrusko was entitled to proceed on the assumption that Ms. Alexander would obey the rules of the road: Pacheco at paras. 11, 15; Nerval at para. 29. She did not do so. Accordingly, I find Ms. Alexander solely responsible for the collision.
Causation
95  The plaintiff must establish on a balance of probabilities that the defendant's negligence caused or materially contributed to an injury. The defendant's negligence need not be the sole cause of the injury so long as it is part of the cause beyond the de minimis range. Causation need not be determined by scientific precision: Athey v. Leonati,  at paras. 13-17.
96  The primary test for causation asks: but for the defendant's negligence, would the plaintiff have suffered the injury? The "but for" test recognizes that an award of compensation for negligent conduct should be made only where a substantial connection between the injury and the defendant's conduct is present: Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke,  at paras. 21-23. Causation must be established on a balance of probabilities before damages are assessed. As McLachlin C.J.C. stated in Blackwater v. Plint,  at para. 78:
[78] It is important to distinguish between causation as the source of the loss and the rules of damage assessment in tort. The rules of causation consider generally whether "but for" the defendant's acts, the plaintiff's damages would have been incurred on a balance of probabilities. Even though there may be several tortious and non-tortious causes of injury, so long as the defendant's act is a cause of the plaintiff's damage, the defendant is fully liable for that damage. The rules of damages then consider what the original position of the plaintiff would have been. The governing principle is that the defendant need not put the plaintiff in a better position than his original position and should not compensate the plaintiff for any damages he would have suffered anyway: Athey. Mr. Barney's submissions that injury from traumas other than the sexual assault should not be excluded amount to the contention that once a tortious act has been found to be a material cause of injury, the defendant becomes liable for all damages complained of after, whether or not the defendant was responsible for those damages.
97  Mr. Andrusko called Dr. James Filbey, who was qualified as a medical doctor with a speciality in physical medicine and rehabilitation and electrodiagnostic medicine. His speciality is more commonly referred to as "physiatry". Dr. Filbey examined Mr. Andrusko and prepared a report on March 9, 2011. He also prepared supplemental reports dated May 13 and November 23, 2011.
98  As will be discussed in more detail below, Dr. Filbey concluded that Mr. Andrusko had a pre-existing pars interarticularis defect, which is a situation where a bony ring in the vertebrae fails to turn into bone and remains a fibrous tissue. This was asymptomatic before the accident. Dr. Filbey concluded that Mr. Andrusko suffered soft tissue injuries which resulted in neck, shoulder and low back pain and that the low back injuries caused the pars defect to become symptomatic and contribute to the pain. Dr. Filbey concluded that it was his opinion that "Mr. Andrusko's current and ongoing symptoms are a direct result of the MVA".
99  At the request of the defence, Mr. Andrusko was seen by Dr. Paul Bishop for an independent medical examination in November 2011. Dr. Bishop is a medical doctor. Although he does not have any recognized speciality from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, as Dr. Filbey has in physiatry, Dr. Bishop has extensive experience in his clinical practice relating to the spine and is involved in teaching and research relating to the spine. He was qualified at the trial as having an expertise in non-operative pathology and diseases of the spine. He provided his report dated November 8, 2011 and supplemental report dated May 23, 2012.
100  Dr. Bishop similarly diagnosed Mr. Andrusko as having mechanical lower back and neck pain. On cross-examination, he acknowledged that these injuries were caused by the accident.
101  On the basis of the medical opinions above, which I accept, particularly that of Dr. Filbey, I conclude that Mr. Andrusko has established on a balance of probabilities that his injuries, as will be described below, were caused by the accident.
Damages
102  Mr. Andrusko's position at trial was that he sustained injuries to his neck, shoulder and low back, and that he has continuous numbness radiating in his left leg. He said that the neck and left shoulder pain improved over the first year or so, but that this pain is now intermittent and occurs about twice per week. Mr. Andrusko's major complaint is that since the accident, he has suffered a continuous low back injury, which is now chronic. This low back injury is to be considered in conjunction with the previously asymptomatic pars interarticularis defect at L5 (which is also called spondylolysis).
103  Ms. Alexander's position is that the neck and shoulder injuries were resolved in one year. Further, Ms. Alexander takes the position that Mr. Andrusko's low back pain arose from mild to moderate soft tissue injuries that were resolved by late 2011.
Summary of Lay Witness Evidence
104  The medical clinical records confirm complaints of pain and numbness in the left leg arising immediately following the accident and complaints of ongoing pain in the lower back continuing to at least October 2009, over a year and a half after the accident:
January 4, 2008 - Dr. Brussow ... has muscle pains - Meds given; O/e stiff neck ... muscular.
...
January 17, 2008 - Dr. Brussow - Pt was in MVC and has back pain .. lumber [sic ] area and sciatica into his [left] leg ... Meds did help but he went to chiropractor and that helped somewhat. ...
...
March 26, 2008 - Dr. Van Zyl - still with some pain in neck and lower back after recent accident ... O: ... some tenderness over trapezius; A: myalgia (post traumatic); P: ... meds
April 23, 2008 - Dr. Van Zyl - still seeing chiropractor, reports pain in lower back, seems like the muscle relaxants worked for the neck spasms at least; O: multiple triggerpoints in lower back; A: post traumatic backpain; P: reassured. advice given on stretches, sleep habits etc.
June 12, 2008 - Dr. Van Zyl - still co lower back pain, says that chiropractor visits not helping, is there an alternative? suggests massage therapy; A: post MVA, mechanical backpain.
October 20, 2008 - Dr. Van Zyl - still with pain after accident requests nalgesia; succeeded in all conservative measures; A: myalgia; P: reassured, see meds.
...
October 19, 2009 - Dr. Van Zyl - doing well, still with ongoing backpain after accident last year. no other problems; A: ongoing mechanical backpain; P: refill of meds
105  Dr. Van Zyl moved back to South Africa about two years ago and did not testify as to his records.
106  I have already indicated that Mr. Andrusko undertook treatments with a chiropractor for about one year after the accident. He then began visits with a physiotherapist in January 2009, a treatment which he found was more helpful. As to the ongoing nature of his symptoms at that time, the physiotherapy records disclose a note on January 30, 2009 that his neck and shoulders were stiff. Mr. Andrusko says that this is consistent with the neck and shoulder pain which was continuing, albeit on an intermittent basis, at that time.
107  During cross-examination, Mr. Andrusko did say that by April 2008, his neck, shoulder and back were not affecting him as much. Mr. Andrusko also agreed during cross-examination that by January 2010, he was only experiencing lower back problems, although he contended that there continued to be intermittent neck and shoulder problems.
108  Mr. Andrusko gave evidence as to the history of his medical complaints arising from the accident in a straightforward manner. I have related some of that history above. Importantly, however, he relates that his improvement has plateaued. He says that at this time, his low back pain and leg numbness remain a fairly constant companion and the neck and shoulder pain arise intermittently. Further, at times, his low back pain is severe depending on his activities at work. He has attempted to address his pain and numbness through exercise and, most recently, physiotherapy.
109  His complaints are corroborated by the evidence of his fiancé, Ms. Stroud. Moreover, somewhat more independent evidence was given by Mr. Higgins, his friend and former co-worker at DGS, concerning ongoing back pain. Mr. Higgins was aware of Mr. Andrusko's low back problems. At times, Mr. Andrusko would mention having problems and that he was taking a break. Mr. Higgins also confirmed that Mr. Andrusko had complaints only a month before Mr. Higgins gave testimony. Mr. Higgins did not consider that Mr. Andrusko was a "complainer". Finally, the most independent evidence came from Mr. Stanway, his boss at Joy Propane, who also confirmed that Mr. Andrusko was put on lighter duties after the accident. While Mr. Andrusko did not call his current supervisor to give evidence at trial, this is understandable since he does not want to advertise his low back difficulties to his current employer.
110  The defence's submissions as to the extent of Mr. Andrusko's injuries are principally directed toward the limited health care that Mr. Andrusko obtained after the accident and the fact that he continued to work the same type of job after the accident.
111  The defence points to the fact that he did not obtain medical treatment at the scene, but that can be balanced against the fact that he sought medical treatment the day after the accident. The defence also points to the 15 chiropractic treatments in 2008, followed by the 11 physiotherapy sessions in 2009. It is true that treatments continued to taper off after that time, with 10 physiotherapy sessions from the beginning of 2010 until November 2012. However, Mr. Andrusko provided evidence that he had difficulty taking time off while working at DGS beginning in early 2010. That would explain the fewer attendances. In addition, during the off-season from working at DGS, there would obviously be less physical strain on his body that would typically give rise to the need for such treatments. Consistent with the DGS working season, he had two attendances at the Fort St. John Medical Clinic relating to the accident injuries in each of 2010 and 2011, early and late in the calendar year. His only attendance in 2012 was also in May.
112  The fact that he takes little medication also does not indicate a lack of ongoing injury. He takes medication only occasionally because he is concerned about being less than alert at work.
113  The defence also suggests that the medical records do not support Mr. Andrusko's ongoing complaints of pain. Yet a review of the records shows ongoing complaints of back pain into 2012. This is less so in relation to the intermittent neck and shoulder pain. This argument raises the same issues as were addressed in Edmondson v. Payer,  at paras. 30-39, aff'd with caveat  at paras. 29-30, concerning whether medical records really do constitute a true record of what a patient might be experiencing ? or not experiencing ? at the time. Mr. Andrusko specifically stated that while the records may indicate only back pain, he did not tell the doctor about all of his complaints of pain at every visit. Rather, he likely mentioned only what was bothering him the most. In that regard, the back pain was always his major complaint. I accept his evidence of the extent of his injuries, as I consider Mr. Andrusko to be a stoic individual. As confirmed by Ms. Stroud and Mr. Higgins, he is not, to put it less elegantly, a complainer. He candidly said that he just pushed through the pain for the most part.
114  Mr. Andrusko also has a particularly brusque manner of speaking. In my view, this negatively affects how he relates his symptoms. This may have contributed to what Mr. Andrusko communicated, or did not communicate, to his health care providers. Accordingly, I do not accept that these clinical records confirm that the soft tissue injuries relating to his neck and shoulder were resolved quickly over some four months, as contended by Ms. Alexander. Nor do I consider that they support the argument that his low back pain and numbness has resolved.
115  Finally, the defence argues that Mr. Andrusko's work record indicates that he has recovered. It points to the fact that Mr. Andrusko finally returned to normal duties at Joy Propane and later obtained very physical jobs at H2Oasis and DGS.
116  Mr. Andrusko is a poor communicator. I have taken that into account in considering his evidence. Whether that comes from his limited education is unclear and likely irrelevant. Derek Nordin, the vocational evaluator who gave evidence at trial, stated that, in his view, Mr. Andrusko was a poor historian and had difficulty relating his history to him. Like Mr. Nordin, however, I consider that he was doing his best in terms of giving an honest account of his injuries since the accident. Again, Mr. Andrusko is a stoic person. He continued working with pain because he simply had no choice. That he continued working does not mean that he was free of pain in doing so.
Expert Testimony
117  Dr. Filbey's report of March 9, 2011 outlined Mr. Andrusko's complaints as outlined above, namely that his neck pain is intermittent and that when he does get a stiff neck it is a sharp and instantaneous pain when he turns right or left. His report records that this occurs once or twice every few months. There was also a report of shoulder pain which was said to happen more frequently than the neck pain and which results in a dull burning pain. This was located in the trapezius and back shoulder region. Mr. Andrusko reported that this was occurring once per week and would occur with long stationary postures. With respect to the low back, Mr. Andrusko reported that this dull pain is present all the time and that he also gets sharp pains that he describes as "unbearable". These sharp pains are followed by numbness in his left leg.
118  As stated above, Dr. Filbey gave his opinion that Mr. Andrusko has low back pain and cervicothoracic pain and that he unfortunately is in the small category of people who have chronic pain.
119  The defence raised the argument that Dr. Filbey's reports were inconsistent with respect to the pars defect that was found on the right side. In his first report, he indicated that the pain was bilateral, meaning that it is on both sides. In his later report, he indicated that the pain was localized to the right side as a result of biomechanical alterations arising from the pars defect. Ms. Alexander argues that Dr. Filbey was backtracking in terms of his explanation for the pain. I do not agree. I take from Dr. Filbey's report that the pain was found in a general area. The fact that it was found more on the right does not change the overall finding. I note that Dr. Bishop found discomfort on the left side. It seems clear that locating and noting pain is not an exact science.
120  The contrary opinion of Dr. Bishop principally centered on his proposition that he could detect no objective findings of abnormality that would explain the ongoing symptoms alleged by Mr. Andrusko. Nor did he find any evidence that the pars defect was playing any role in Mr. Andrusko's low back pain. On that basis, he concluded that it would be reasonable for Mr. Andrusko to suffer an acute phase after the accident of 12 to 16 weeks. Dr. Bishop acknowledged that during this period of recovery Mr. Andrusko was likely to experience an increase in the intensity of his pain symptoms, but that was normal. After that time, he was unable to relate any of Mr. Andrusko's ongoing spine-related symptoms directly to the trauma arising from the accident. At the time of his report in November 2011, Dr. Bishop considered that Mr. Andrusko's prognosis for a full recovery to his pre-accident level was "good".
121  Nevertheless, on cross-examination, Dr. Bishop agreed that pain is often unable to be related to any other objective criteria. He agreed that many patients have pain and doctors cannot determine what is wrong with them. He agreed that pain can be very disabling. In his practice, if the disability, as self-reported by the patient, exceeds the impairment and is ruled out on a purely objective basis, he would normally look for other factors that might be contributing to the ongoing pain. He indicated that Mr. Andrusko had one of these, but he did not identify that risk factor. In any event, he indicated that further testing should be done on Mr. Andrusko to determine whether there is anything else contributing to the matter.
122  Dr. Bishop confirmed that in a small proportion of people who experience pain, 5% of them will continue to suffer with chronic pain. In that situation, the medical profession typically turns to consider pain management techniques.
123  There is obviously a need in this case to carefully consider Mr. Andrusko's subjective evidence as to the extent of his injuries. That and the conflict in the medical evidence concerning objective evidence of impairment invites a consideration of the oft-quoted comments of the court regarding subjective reports of pain. The correct and cautious approach to assessing injuries which depend on subjective reports of pain was discussed in Price v. Kostryba  at 399 (S.C.) by McEachern C.J. In referring to an earlier decision, he said:
In Butler v. Blaylock, , decided 7th October 1981, Vancouver No. B781505 (unreported), I referred to counsel's argument that a defendant is often at the mercy of a plaintiff in actions for damages for personal injuries because complaints of pain cannot easily be disproved. I then said:
I am not stating any new principle when I say that the court should be exceedingly careful when there is little or no objective evidence of continuing injury and when complaints of pain persist for long periods extending beyond the normal or usual recovery.
An injured person is entitled to be fully and properly compensated for any injury or disability caused by a wrongdoer. But no one can expect his fellow citizen or citizens to compensate him in the absence of convincing evidence - which could be just his own evidence if the surrounding circumstances are consistent - that his complaints of pain are true reflections of a continuing injury.
Summary of the Injuries Caused by the Accident
124  As I have indicated above, I consider Mr. Andrusko to have been a credible witness. I found that he attempted to give his evidence in terms of his injuries in an honest and forthright manner. As stated above, Mr. Andrusko is not a very good communicator and I have taken that into account in considering his evidence. I also consider that he is a stoic individual who does not want others to think of him as a "complainer".
125  The extent of his injuries was confirmed by the evidence of Ms. Stroud, who I also found to be a credible witness.
126  Moreover, Mr. Andrusko's evidence is supported by the clinical records of the Fort St. John Medical Clinic. While I appreciate that the clinical notes do not record every single complaint made by Mr. Andrusko on a particular day, they generally reflect his ongoing complaints and the treatment of those complaints over the period of time of those records. The physiotherapy and chiropractic reports also provide independent confirmation of Mr. Andrusko's complaints over this period of time.
127  The independent evidence of Mr. Stanway and Mr. Higgins further confirms Mr. Andrusko's complaints about his low back, shoulder and neck pain in the workplace.
128  Finally, I have considered Dr. Bishop's concerns about the lack of objective evidence of Mr. Andrusko's pain. For the most part, Dr. Bishop's rejection of physical examination techniques was based on research examining the reliability of various procedures to determine tenderness, such as palpation. In light of this, I have approached that matter with some caution.
129  I am particularly persuaded by Dr. Filbey's evidence concerning the difficulty that he himself acknowledged was present when confirming pain in similar situations. Dr. Filbey said that with respect to musculoskeletal injuries such as that suffered by Mr. Andrusko, the fact that a diagnosis is largely based on a patient's subjective complaints of pain is hardly unusual. Nevertheless, Dr. Filbey indicated that he takes steps to test the complaints of pain in an organized fashion that allows him to form some view as to whether the subjective complaints are justified. In this case, he expressed no hesitation in confirming his opinion that Mr. Andrusko's complaints are real. In addition, Dr. Filbey indicated that he relied not only on Mr. Andrusko's complaints of pain but also on his own physical examination and review of all of the relevant records and medical tests.
130  Overall, I consider Dr. Filbey's reports to be a more comprehensive consideration of the circumstances relating to Mr. Andrusko. To a large extent, Dr. Bishop seems to have relied upon various research results which addressed certain issues within a large population base. As Dr. Filbey said, research is fine, but it must be balanced against the actual individual that is before you with a particular problem. In addition, I consider that Dr. Filbey was better qualified from a medical perspective to opine on Mr. Andrusko's issues in this particular situation. Overall, I found Dr. Filbey's reports to be consistent in terms of his findings of pain. Accordingly, where there is a difference of opinion as between the two doctors, I prefer and accept the evidence and opinion of Dr. Filbey.
131  On the basis of the lay witness evidence and the expert evidence of Dr. Filbey, I find the following facts in relation to the determination of Mr. Andrusko's injuries:
Mr. Andrusko suffered injuries to his neck and shoulder, which were largely resolved within one year. Pain from those areas continues to flare up from time to time, about once per week, at which time the pain is severe; and
Mr. Andrusko suffered injuries to his low back such that he has constant pain in that area, which is at times severe. In conjunction with this low back pain, Mr. Andrusko suffers from persistent numbness in his left leg on a regular basis.
132  I also find that further improvement of these injuries is unlikely. To use the medical term, Mr. Andrusko's condition is now "chronic".
Quantum of Damages
Non-Pecuniary Damages
133  Non-pecuniary damages are awarded to compensate the plaintiff for pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of amenities. The compensation awarded should be fair to all parties. Fairness is measured against awards made in comparable cases. However, such cases, though helpful, serve only as a rough guide. Each case depends on its own unique facts: Trites v. Penner,  at paras. 188-189.
134  In Stapley v. Hejslet, , the Court of Appeal outlined the factors to be considered when assessing non-pecuniary damages:
[46] The inexhaustive list of common factors cited in Boyd [v. Harris, ] that influence an award of non-pecuniary damages includes:
age of the plaintiff;
nature of the injury;
severity and duration of pain;
disability;
emotional suffering; and
loss or impairment of life;
I would add the following factors, although they may arguably be subsumed in the above list:
impairment of family, marital and social relationships;
impairment of physical and mental abilities;
loss of lifestyle; and
the plaintiff's stoicism (as a factor that should not, generally speaking, penalize the plaintiff: Giang v. Clayton,  (QL), ).
135  The assessment of non-pecuniary damages is necessarily influenced by the individual plaintiff's personal experiences in dealing with his injuries and their consequences, and the plaintiff's ability to articulate that experience: Dilello v. Montgomery,  at para. 25.
136  Mr. Andrusko cites Pett v. Pett,  and Miller v. Lawlor,  in support of an award of <damage type = "other">$85,000</damage>. In Pett, a young man who was a construction worker was injured and had suffered neck and shoulder injuries which resolved fairly quickly. His chronic lower back pain persisted and affected both his work and recreational activities. Non-pecuniary damages in the amount of <damage type = "other">$85,000</damage> were awarded. In Miller, a young man suffered injuries giving rise to chronic pain, which affected his physical work and recreational activities. The award was <damage type = "other">$65,000</damage>.
137  Counsel for Ms. Alexander agreed that if I rejected her submissions on the extent of Mr. Andrusko's injuries, which I have, the range suggested by Mr. Andrusko for non-pecuniary damages was appropriate.
138  I consider that the circumstances in Pett are the closest to those of Mr. Andrusko. Both cases involve young men who are involved in very physical jobs. Both are considered stoic in that they work through the pain. Like Mr. Pett, some of Mr. Andrusko's injuries have abated, but they remain intermittent to this time. They also generally return when Mr. Andrusko's job activities exacerbate that pain, something that happens fairly frequently. The low back pain and leg numbness is persistent and will be a condition that Mr. Andrusko lives with for the rest of his life.
139  While most of the impact of Mr. Andrusko's injuries is being experienced in his working life, it has also impacted his personal life, particularly his relationship with Ms. Stroud. Also, his ability to work at his DJ business has been affected in the sense that it is uncomfortable to sit for long periods of time without pain.
140  In addition, Dr. Filbey indicated in his report that Mr. Andrusko could continue to do his housekeeping and yard work on his own, although in less than 20 years he would more than likely require assistance for heavy seasonal tasks. These circumstances are factors that may be considered in the assessment of non-pecuniary damages: McTavish v. MacGillivray,  at para. 73.
141  In Pett, the plaintiff's injuries had a significant impact on his recreational activities. I do not consider that Mr. Andrusko's non-work activities have been as negatively affected.
142  Taking all the circumstances into account, I award the sum of <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$80,000</damage>.
Loss of Future Earning Capacity
143  One of the most controversial issues at the trial concerned Mr. Andrusko's prognosis and ability to earn income in the future.
144  A claim for loss of future earning capacity raises two key questions: 1) has the plaintiff's earning capacity been impaired by his or her injuries; and 2) if so, what compensation should be awarded for the resulting financial harm that will accrue over time? The appropriate means of assessment will vary from case to case: Brown v. Golaiy  (S.C.); Pallos v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia  (C.A.); Pett.
145  Insofar as it is possible, the plaintiff should be put in the position he or she would have been in but for the injuries caused by the defendant's negligence: Lines v. W & D Logging Co. Ltd.,  at para. 185. The essential task of the court is to compare the likely future of the plaintiff's working life if the accident had not happened with the plaintiff's likely future working life after the accident: Gregory v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia,  at para. 32.
146  The plaintiff must always prove that there is a real and substantial possibility of a future event leading to an income loss: Perren v. Lalari,  at para. 32. If that burden is met, then there are two possible approaches to assessing the loss of future earning capacity: the "earnings approach" from Pallos; and the "capital asset approach" in Brown. Both approaches are correct and will be more or less appropriate depending on whether the loss in question can be quantified in a measureable way: Perren at para. 32.
147  The earnings approach involves a form of math-oriented methodology such as (i) postulating a minimum annual income loss for the plaintiff's remaining years of work, multiplying the annual projected loss by the number of remaining years and calculating a present value, or (ii) awarding the plaintiff's entire annual income for a year or two: Pallos; Gilbert v. Bottle,  at para. 233.
148  The capital asset approach involves considering factors such as whether the plaintiff: (i) has been rendered less capable overall of earning income from all types of employment; (ii) is less marketable or attractive as a potential employee; (iii) has lost the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities that might otherwise have been open; and (iv) is less valuable to herself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour market: Brown; Gilbert at para. 233.
149  The principles that apply in assessing loss of future earning capacity were summarized by Low J.A. in Reilly v. Lynn,  at para. 101:
[101] The relevant principles may be briefly summarized. The standard of proof in relation to future events is simple probability, not the balance of probabilities, and hypothetical events are to be given weight according to their relative likelihood: Athey v. Leonati,  at para. 27. A plaintiff is entitled to compensation for real and substantial possibilities of loss, which are to be quantified by estimating the chance of the loss occurring: Athey v. Leonati, supra, at para. 27, Steenblok v. Funk  at 135 (C.A.). The valuation of the loss of earning capacity may involve a comparison of what the plaintiff would probably have earned but for the accident with what he will probably earn in his injured condition: Milina v. Bartsch  at 93 (S.C.). However, that is not the end of the inquiry; the overall fairness and reasonableness of the award must be considered: Rosvold v. Dunlop,  at para. 11; Ryder v. Paquette,  (C.A.) (Q.L.). Moreover, the task of the Court is to assess the losses, not to calculate them mathematically: Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate  (C.A.). Finally, since the course of future events is unknown, allowance must be made for the contingency that the assumptions upon which the award is based may prove to be wrong: Milina v. Bartsch, supra, at 79. ...
150  Dr. Filbey, consistent with the evidence of both Mr. Andrusko and Ms. Stroud, found that it was more likely than not that he had reached a point of maximum medical improvement. He concluded that Mr. Andrusko was more likely than not to remain symptomatic at his current level, assuming that he continues to exercise and obtains therapy as needed. Dr. Filbey concluded that the pars defect was associated with biomechanical alterations in his back area following the symptom development, which predisposed Mr. Andrusko to be more recalcitrant to treatment and recovery in the low back. Dr. Filbey stated that there was a "real" possibility that Mr. Andrusko would have increased lower back symptoms in the future:
It is possible that 10-15 years down the road he will have some increased low back pain related to the symptomatic pars defect. Such aggravation would likely increase his symptoms burden in the lumbar spine. The cervicothoracic and costovertebral symptoms are likely to remain stable without significant change based upon the current pattern.
151  Dr. Filbey also addressed Mr. Andrusko's prognosis given his chosen line of work in manual labor:
Occupationally, Mr. Andrusko is a manual worker. He has limited educational background to grade 10 and does not plan on further formal education. He enjoys manual labour and is able to tolerate such work but it is evident from his reports that he has symptom aggravation with such tasks. It is reasonable to assume that he will be able to continue with such employment as tolerated but his durability over the long-term with such works may be less. It is my opinion that over by 10-15 years from now, his low back symptoms are likely to be increased with manual labour and will limit his employment opportunity and durability.
He would be best suited for work that sedentary or light. Moderate tasks may be tolerable to him so long as he can vary his tasks and activities during the day. Heavy regular labour is not recommended for him based upon his symptom profile. If Mr. Andrusko avoids symptom aggravation with manual work at this time, his prognosis in the future may be improved from a symptomatic perspective.
152  As stated above, Mr. Andrusko called Mr. Nordin of The Vocational Consulting Group. He was qualified as an expert vocational assessor and counsellor. Mr. Nordin prepared a report dated January 19, 2012 and a supplemental report dated August 20, 2012. Mr. Andrusko was interviewed in Vancouver on November 9, 2011 and given a variety of aptitude and other tests. Mr. Nordin relies on the results of the testing, certain self-reporting by Mr. Andrusko of his symptoms, and the reports of Dr. Filbey.
153  Of particular importance to Mr. Nordin was Dr. Filbey's diagnosis of neck, shoulder and low back pain and that his low back symptoms would, within 10 to 15 years, likely increase with manual labour, limiting his employment opportunity and durability. Mr. Nordin was asked to assume that Mr. Andrusko would work at his job for the next 15 to 20 years and then stop, and to provide his opinion of what would be the consequences to Mr. Andrusko vocationally. In addition, Mr. Nordin was asked to comment on options available to Mr. Andrusko if he followed Dr. Filbey's advice to change his occupation to one that requires lighter strength.
154  The results of the testing indicated that Mr. Andrusko scored well below average in reading, spelling and math. In fact, in most of those subjects, he was even well below the grade 10 level that he had achieved in high school. Mr. Nordin concluded that Mr. Andrusko was not a strong candidate for further schooling. He further concluded that Mr. Andrusko should stay employed as at present and that his prospects were not good if his low back pain prevented him from continuing in the future. Essentially, Mr. Andrusko would be limited to lighter strength work and a corresponding loss of income:
In my opinion, Mr. Andrusko is not likely going to be able to complete any program of a post-secondary academic nature, including most high end trades training (i.e. plumbing, electrical, mechanical, etc.).
I believe Mr. Andrusko is an individual who does have some potential to acquire skills but this will be through on the job training/experience (much as he has done to date).
...
In my opinion, he is an unsuitable candidate for retraining based on his current education level, his unsuccessful attempts to complete further grade levels, his poor grades, his expressed disinterest in returning to school, his academic achievement as measured by [the testing], as well as his weak scores on most subscales of the GATB aptitude assessment, particularly General Learning Ability.
...
From these work experiences, he has demonstrated potential to acquire skills through on the job training/experience. Since he is likely not able to complete any program of a post-secondary academic nature, including most high end trades training, he is essentially relegated to unskilled or semi-skilled work.
Occupations suitable for Mr. Andrusko, therefore, would include other entry level occupations dependent on what he can physically manage.
...
If in the future he is unable to engage in work of heavy or medium strength nature, then he will most likely be left with lighter strength occupations and potentially lower residual earning capacity.
At the present time, his best vocational option is to stay where he is currently working.
155  In Mr. Nordin's supplemental report, he was asked to comment on the suitability of certain occupations for Mr. Andrusko given his limitations. He considered examples such as truck drivers and landscape and grounds maintenance workers, all considered to be medium strength jobs. Assuming that his low back pain conditions continued into the future, Mr. Nordin was of the view that Mr. Andrusko was not suited for work as a long-distance truck driver. He could possibly be considered for local truck driving positions, where he would have the opportunity of getting out of the truck during the course of a workday. It was Mr. Nordin's experience, however, that individuals who have low back pain are generally ill-suited for any kind of truck driving position, given that truck drivers are often required to do manual work, such as chaining tires. Mr. Nordin was also of the view that Mr. Andrusko was not suitable for work as a landscape and grounds maintenance worker given the significant amount of bending and lifting involved in those activities.
156  Mr. Nordin was also asked what options Mr. Andrusko would be left with if he was no longer able to continue working at DGS or if he lost his job. Mr. Nordin considered that working as a fry cook may be possible, although some bending and lifting would be involved in that that job.
157  Finally, Mr. Nordin was asked whether Mr. Andrusko would be at a disadvantage competing for work with others who did not have low back pain or that type of limitation. Mr. Nordin stated categorically that Mr. Andrusko likely would be at a disadvantage. Specifically, Mr. Nordin stated that "Mr. Andrusko has very limited education and his primary asset was his ability to engage in physical demanding work". Mr. Nordin also examined the types of employment that are generally available in the Fort St. John area. With the exception of retail and hospitality (where he might work as a cashier at substantially lower pay), the remaining sectors of oil and gas, services, forestry, construction and agriculture all tend to be physically demanding. Consequently, Mr. Nordin concluded:
...if he is not able to engage in technical or trade work and/or heavy labouring work, the remaining opportunities for him are significantly reduced (particularly in light of his limited education).
...if Mr. Andrusko is not able to continue in labouring work, his residual vocational options are going to be quite limited (as will be his residual earning potential).
158  Mr. Stanway, his boss at Joy Propane, is now employed at CalGas in Fort St. John, which is involved in the bulk delivery of propane. As at Joy Propane, Mr. Stanway is in charge of hiring and firing employees. He gave evidence that if a worker applied for a job and it was disclosed that he or she had a back problem, he probably would not hire that person. His concern would be that bulk truck drivers sometimes have to do heavy physical work, such as putting chains on vehicles. In addition, Mr. Stanway was concerned about possible WorksafeBC claims increasing if claims for further injury were made. Mr. Nordin expressed the same concerns as Mr. Stanway in his supplemental report about Mr. Andrusko having to reveal his ongoing symptoms, either to his current or any future employer.
159  Ms. Alexander advanced a number of challenges to the conclusions reached in Mr. Nordin's report. Ms. Alexander contended that Mr. Nordin did not test Mr. Andrusko for tolerance for sitting, reaching and bending. He is said to have just accepted the self-reporting by Mr. Andrusko, who said that he experienced increased pain with prolonged sitting. I accept Mr. Nordin's evidence that it is hard to ask someone to quantify tolerance because it is more a qualitative experience. In any event, I have accepted Mr. Andrusko's evidence on his pain tolerance.
160  Ms. Alexander's principal challenge to Mr. Nordin's report was the suggestion that Mr. Andrusko should go back to school to upgrade his skills and education. However, Mr. Nordin says that this option is not feasible. Mr. Andrusko did not do well at school and is not interested in further schooling. Mr. Nordin considered that any such effort would likely be met with failure. I agree with his assessment. Mr. Andrusko is quite aware that formal education is not his strong suit. He does not have the intellectual capacity or inclination to benefit from further schooling.
161  The difficulty with Ms. Alexander's arguments is that they do not recognize the reality of Mr. Andrusko's life and prospects. He is not intellectually inclined or able to pursue many kinds of jobs. His major asset in terms of making a living is his physical strength and his ability to perform manual types of jobs. To that extent, having a healthy neck, shoulders and lower back quite simply becomes a critical requirement in performing those jobs. Mr. Andrusko is quite aware of his limitations in that respect and has quite properly concentrated his efforts on securing manual labour jobs. Perhaps he may have the opportunity at DGS to move to a foreman position, but paperwork is required and he has trouble reading and writing. In addition, a foreman has to deal with customers and, as stated above, Mr. Andrusko is not very well suited to address that aspect of the job given his personality.
162  This not a situation where, for example, a highly educated surgeon injures his hands and has the opportunity to be retrained in another line of medical work. Mr. Andrusko has no other skills upon which to draw. His options are limited. Here, the accident has damaged his major asset: his ability to perform very physical work.
163  The classic statement is that a defendant takes her victim as she finds him. In Pett, the court rejected the trial judge's comments that a negative contingency arose from the limited education of the plaintiff:
[16] I am not sure that I would have considered the education level of the appellant to be what the trial judge described as a negative contingency. In my view, this was simply a factual circumstance concerning this particular plaintiff that engages the principle that a tortfeasor must take the victim as he or she is. I would prefer to characterize this as a negative circumstance concerning this appellant because his modest educational level circumscribes the range of possible avenues of employment open to him. He, like several others of the family connection, had made a decision to not pursue higher education because of a history of available employment in occupational activity with a heavy physical component. That choice may not have been an unreasonable one when made, but, in the altered circumstances now facing this appellant, he is perhaps more affected than would be the case of someone who possesses enhanced educational credentials. I do not concur with the language of the judge in para. 77 when he speaks about the "education level for which the defendant is not responsible". While, of course, the defendant has nothing to do with the earlier choice the appellant made about his education, the defendant is responsible for the impact the accident has had, and will have, on this young appellant of limited educational attainment. He must take the appellant as he finds him. In my respectful view, the judge's treatment of this issue is problematic for the reasons I have discussed. [Emphasis added.]
164  The other limitation faced by Mr. Andrusko is that given his temperament, he neither likes to deal with nor is he good in dealing with the public. He does not have a personality that is conducive to dealing with the public. Again, this is a reality that he must face in terms of considering his options going forward. It is also a circumstance that must be factored into an assessment of how his employment options have been narrowed.
165  In short, Mr. Andrusko is extremely limited in his career options going forward. He has a very limited education. His reading and writing skills are minimal at best. He must rely on his physical strength and prowess to make a living. To the extent that his physical abilities have been compromised, however, there remains an issue as to whether he will be able to work at these labour-intensive jobs into the future. Dr. Filbey is of the opinion that Mr. Andrusko's lower back symptoms will likely increase in 10 to 15 years. If that occurs, Mr. Andrusko's ability to continue in this type of intensely physical job will be put in doubt. Further, given his limited education, it is not a realistic option for Mr. Andrusko to be retrained in another type of occupation that would be less physically demanding and would provide the same level of income he currently enjoys. His personality also limits the certain types of jobs he may seek. In the Fort St. John area, where he lives, most jobs at the higher income scales involve some physicality.
166  Ms. Alexander says that Dr. Filbey's conclusions are only speculation and that there is only a mere possibility, not a substantial possibility, that Mr. Andrusko's injuries will limit his employment opportunities. She points to his continuing employment over the last five years in his physical jobs.
167  In support of her position, she cites Samson v. Aubin,  and Fifi v. Robinson, , although the facts in those cases are distinguishable. In Samson, the plaintiff's injuries were known and accommodated: paras. 57-64. In this case, Mr. Andrusko has not disclosed his injuries, and for good reason. Mr. Stanway's evidence supports the position that disclosure of his injuries may give rise to workplace issues which may negatively affect Mr. Andrusko's employability. Furthermore, in Samson, the medical evidence from the plaintiff's own doctor did not support his argument: para. 61. This is in contrast to support from Dr. Filbey's medical opinion and from Mr. Nordin's report. In Fifi, the court found that improvement of the injuries was likely and that such arguments for this type of award were speculative. The plaintiff's unreliable evidence was not corroborated by her employer, nor was it supported by medical evidence: paras. 132-138.
168  Mr. Andrusko suggests that based on the four factors noted by Finch J. (as he then was) in Brown, he has established a real and substantial possibility of a loss of future earning capacity. I agree. Mr. Andrusko has established a real and substantial possibility of a future event leading to an income loss based on his evidence and the evidence of Mr. Stanway and Mr. Higgins, and based on the reports of Dr. Filbey and Mr. Nordin, all of which I accept.
169  Mr. Andrusko has been rendered less capable of earning income from labour jobs, and his injuries will affect his marketability in terms of continuing at or securing these types of jobs in the future. His injuries will also affect his ability to take advantage of opportunities in the future. Lastly, I consider that Mr. Andrusko is less valuable to himself as a person capable of earning income. He is a young man who has worked from a young age to support himself and who recognizes the need to continue his employment. He must rely on his own resources, such as they are now, to make his way in the world. Those resources include his physical body. This is not the same situation considered in Pett and Miller where the plaintiffs worked in family businesses and could expect some accommodation in the workplace. The medical evidence supports the conclusion that in 10 to 15 years, his symptoms will likely increase to the point of compromising his ability to continue in this type of employment. Mr. Andrusko is concerned about his ability to continue with his only realistic type of employment, particularly where his other options are otherwise limited. These other options also do not provide the same level of income as he currently enjoys.
170  With respect to quantifying damages, given Mr. Andrusko's young age, his present employment, and the uncertainties arising from his future career path, I consider that the capital asset approach is appropriate: Perren; Miller at para. 129.
171  Mr. Andrusko submits that an appropriate award is <damage type = "other">$300,000</damage>, based on the following: he is currently 26 years old, he has limited education, and he has challenges in dealing with the public and in performing many types of jobs in the Fort St. John area. Ms. Alexander did not make any submissions on the assessment of this award in the event that I found in favour of Mr. Andrusko on the threshold question.
172  It must be emphasized again that the determination of the damages for loss of earning capacity is not a mathematical calculation. Rather, it is an assessment or estimate of the loss after considering the evidence: Morris v. Rose Estate  (C.A.) at para. 28; Miller at paras. 132-33. Nevertheless, the courts have consistently used mathematical calculations as "guideposts" to provide some parameters towards arriving at that estimate: Morris at paras. 20-24. With a young person at the start of their working life, the court's task of peering into the future is undeniably made more difficult: Morris at para. 21; Pett at para. 21.
173  In Morris v. Rose Estate,  (S.C.) at paras. 57-64, the trial judge used a mathematical calculation for loss of earning capacity of a young 23-year-old plaintiff, together with an amount for general impairment, to arrive at a figure of <damage type = "other">$140,000</damage>. The Court of Appeal considered this inadequate and increased the total award to <damage type = "other">$250,000</damage>: Morris at para. 27.
174  Mr. Andrusko provided a mathematical calculation for consideration by the court. In 2012, Mr. Andrusko earned <damage type = "other">$52,000</damage> at DGS plus <damage type = "other">$9,600</damage> for employment insurance, for a total of approximately <damage type = "other">$62,000</damage>. Mr. Nordin identified that a lighter type of occupation available to Mr. Andrusko may be working as a cashier, whose average earnings are <damage type = "other">$30,000</damage>. If that comparison was used from age 40, there would be an annual loss of about <damage type = "other">$30,000</damage> over a period of 25 years (assuming a retirement age of 65). After applying a discount rate, the total present value is <damage type = "other">$552,732</damage>. This figure does not include any adjustment for contingencies, both positive and negative. Those unknowns of course include when he may have to cease doing labour jobs, what employment he is able to get in the off-season and at what wage, or what his "replacement" job might be if he quits physical labour jobs and what wage he might earn.
175  In Pett v. Pett, , the trial judge accepted a loss of earning capacity based on the medical evidence that the 23-year-old plaintiff suffered from a disabling back condition that would limit his available employment in the future. He awarded <damage type = "other">$120,000</damage>: para. 79.
176  The Court of Appeal in Pett increased the award to <damage type = "other">$225,000</damage>. The court considered the actuarial evidence and a mathematical calculation similar to the one above. After applying appropriate discounts and general contingencies, it arrived at a "useful starting point for an analysis" of <damage type = "other">$300,000</damage>. The court rejected the substantial discount applied by the trial judge in light of the plaintiff's positive work ethic and the opportunities for employment through the plaintiff's family connections: paras. 23-25. As above, the court also rejected what seemed to be the application of a negative contingency given the lack of education achieved by the plaintiff: paras. 16, 24.
177  Mr. Andrusko also has a positive work ethic, but he unfortunately does not have the added benefit of expecting that his employment will be secured through such family connections.
178  In Miller, the young 24-year-old pipefitter was being accommodated in the employ of his father's business. His injuries prevented him from completing certain jobs, although he pushed through the pain given his strong work ethic, similar to what Mr. Andrusko does at his job. The court noted that using the mathematical or projected earnings approach outlined above may be more appropriate where the plaintiff has evidence of income before the accident as compared to a different job after the accident: para. 126. The court awarded the sum of <damage type = "other">$210,000</damage>, which equated to three years of annual income: paras. 139-140.
179  There was no expert evidence, including actuarial evidence, adduced here, as there was in Pett, about what contingencies might generally be applied to the mathematical calculations set out above. Nevertheless, those general contingencies not specific to the facts of the case resulted in a reduction of 37%. In this case, such a general negative contingency reduces the amount to <damage type = "other">$352,000</damage>. From that starting point, and keeping in mind the conservative approach adopted in Pett at para. 24, further contingencies must be applied. Again, as in Pett, Mr. Andrusko has a good work ethic, which would suggest a lower negative contingency to be applied, but he does not have the same security of employment that arose in that case.
180  As with any situation involving a young plaintiff whose career paths are somewhat uncertain, I must now embark upon gazing into the "crystal ball".
181  I am persuaded that Mr. Andrusko's injuries will likely affect his ability to work and thus will impact his future employment. His employment options have been narrowed in the labour market, and it is a likely possibility that his earnings will be affected in the future. There are positive factors, such as Mr. Andrusko's work ethic, which I believe supports the view that he will continue to work and push through the pain to the extent that he is able. Negative factors arise because of the reality that employers look for healthy employees who can perform the required functions and who will need not resort to insurance claims such as through WorksafeBC. Mr. Andrusko is competing in an increasingly competitive work environment and will be required to compete with healthy men for these jobs.
182  Given all the foregoing, I award the sum of <damage type = "future wage loss">$250,000</damage> under this head of damages.
Costs of Future Care
183  The plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the cost of future care based on what is reasonably necessary to restore him to his pre-accident condition insofar as that is possible. When full restoration cannot be achieved, the court must strive to assure full compensation through the provision of adequate future care. The award is to be based on what is reasonably necessary on the medical evidence to preserve and promote the plaintiff's mental and physical health: Milina v. Bartsch  (S.C.C.); Williams v. Low, ; Spehar et al. v. Beazley et al., .
184  The test for determining the appropriate award under the heading of cost of future care is an objective one based on medical evidence. For an award of future care: (i) there must be a medical justification for claims for cost of future care; and (ii) the claims must be reasonable: Milina at 84.
185  The award of damages is thus a matter of prediction of what will happen in the future. If a plaintiff has not used a particular item or service in the past, it may be inappropriate to include its cost in a future care award: Izony v. Weidlich,  at para. 74.
186  The extent to which a future care costs award should be adjusted for contingencies, if any, depends on the specific care needs of the plaintiff. In some cases, negative contingencies are offset by positive contingencies and a contingency adjustment is not required. In other cases, however, the award is reduced based on the prospect of improvement in the plaintiff's condition or increased based on the prospect that additional care will be required. Each case falls to be determined on its particular facts: Gilbert at para. 253.
187  An assessment of damages for cost of future care is not a precise accounting exercise: Krangle (Guardian ad litem of) v. Brisco,  at para. 21.
188  Dr. Filbey recommended that Mr. Andrusko consider further treatments, being a six-month course with a kinesiologist to develop a core fitness routine and program and up to 12 sessions of physiotherapy in a year for acute or chronic symptom aggravation. He also recommended analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications as needed, although Dr. Filbey thought this would likely gradually increase over time. Since Mr. Andrusko is engaged in his own exercise program now, no award is sought for the expense of a kinesiologist.
189  Mr. Andrusko seeks an award for future physiotherapy sessions, which at 12 sessions have an annual cost of <damage type = "other">$660</damage>. Taking this amount to age 65 and applying a discount factor of 3.5% and a present value factor, the total is $13,927. He seeks $10,000 to account for contingencies. Ms. Alexander says that this amount is excessive since he has only had three or four sessions per year for 2011 and 2012. I would note, however, that the low number of sessions is largely driven by his work schedule at DGS, which does not accommodate time off to obtain treatment. That may change over time if he switches to another job or another type of job in the future.
190  He also seeks an award of <damage type = "other">$2,250</damage> for medications, which reflects the nominal amount presently spent per year (<damage type = "other">$30</damage>) to age <damage type = "other">41</damage> and an estimated doubling of that cost for another 30 years to age 70.
191  Again, Dr. Bishop took a very theoretical approach to the issue as to what benefits Mr. Andrusko might enjoy by further treatments as recommended by Dr. Filbey. He did not state this as an opinion. Rather, he referred to "recently published clinical practice guidelines" that he says recommend against the use of passive based treatments, such as physiotherapy and massage therapy, and the prolonged use of any medications. He indicated that he did not know of any studies that validate the use of chiropractic spinal manipulation therapy. He noted that such therapies may promote the wrong behavior in the sense that the patient becomes erroneously dependent upon these therapies when in fact they are improving regardless of those therapies. Accordingly, he recommends that Mr. Andrusko avoid all of these forms of treatment.
192  Dr. Filbey addressed his recommendation for further physiotherapy treatments in the context of Dr. Bishop's opinion. Dr. Filbey also referred to the research identified by Dr. Bishop and spoke about the limitations of that research in the context of an individual assessment. In his extensive practice, he recommends these types of treatments. If the patient responds, he promotes those treatments. Dr. Filbey's explanation was, in my view, reasonable and informed by much common sense. In addition, Dr. Filbey does not recommend that there be extensive physiotherapy sessions for the rest of Mr. Andrusko's life (which is reasonable given his past need for such therapy). Rather, he is recommending physiotherapy on an intermittent basis if such is needed for the purpose of getting Mr. Andrusko back to his activities.
193  In my view, Dr. Filbey's recommendations regarding continuing physiotherapy reflects a reasonable approach, both in terms of the benefits that Mr. Andrusko has received to date and his likely need for continuing treatment given his condition. However, I consider that 12 sessions per year is excessive, particularly since Mr. Andrusko only works part of the year, when the aggravation of his symptoms would occur.
194  I also agree with the recommendations concerning medication. While Mr. Andrusko's use of pain medication is now somewhat minimal, that is likely to change and increase as he ages. The defence took no issue on the estimated amounts.
195  With the exception of the number of physiotherapy sessions, the calculations provided by Mr. Andrusko, including the appropriate discount and contingency factors and present value calculations, are reasonable. I would reduce the claimed amount for physiotherapy to $7,750. Accordingly, the amount of <damage type = "future care">$10,000</damage> is awarded for future care.
Special Damages
196  It is well established that an injured person is entitled to recover the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses they incurred as a result of an accident. This is grounded in the fundamental governing principle that an injured person is to be restored to the position he or she would have been in had the accident not occurred: X. v. Y.,  at para. 281; Milina at 78.
197  Mr. Andrusko claims various expenses, as follows: chiropractic bills - <damage type = "sub-special">$575</damage>; physiotherapy bills - <damage type = "sub-special">$725</damage>; medication - <damage type = "sub-special">$341.91</damage>; and miscellaneous expenses (back belt, massage therapy and exercise ball) - <damage type = "sub-special">$79.52</damage>.
198  I am satisfied that all of these expenses were incurred as a result of the accident and were reasonably incurred in aid of Mr. Andrusko's attempts to address his injuries. The amount of <damage type = "special">$1,721.43</damage> is awarded.
Summary
199  In summary, damages are awarded as follows:
Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$80,000</damage>;
Diminishment of earning capacity: <damage type = "future wage loss">$250,000</damage>;
Cost of future care: <damage type = "future care">$10,000</damage>;
Special damages: <damage type = "special">$1,721.43</damage>.
Costs
200  Mr. Andrusko is entitled to pre-judgment interest on the special damages awarded. Mr. Andrusko is also entitled to his costs, unless the parties seek to make further submissions in that respect. If further submissions are to be made, they must be filed within 30 days of the delivery of this judgment.

Action by the plaintiff, Anderson, against the defendant, Minhas, for damages to compensate for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. In April 2007, the defendant's vehicle rear-ended the plaintiff's vehicle. The impact was described as minor. The defendant admitted liability for the collision. Prior to the accident, the plaintiff, age 29, had ongoing episodes of back, neck and chest pain. She worked at a dog grooming business, earning approximately $8,000 per year, and engaged in a variety of recreational activities. The plaintiff testified that the impact caused her chest to strike the steering wheel and her head to strike the headrest. She heard her neck crack and was dazed by the impact. She left work after a few hours to seek medical attention at a clinic and attended her family physician the following day. She attended physiotherapy and took medication, but her condition worsened throughout 2007. She developed lower back pain, leg pain, hand pain, pain and numbness in her face, and blurry vision. In 2008, she developed headaches. However, she did not report her symptoms to her physician until April 2008, because she believed they would resolve with time. The plaintiff was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in January 2009. The plaintiff claimed that her whiplash injuries evolved into fibromyalgia, resulting in a significant physical disability. The defendant submitted that the plaintiff failed to prove a sufficient causal link between the collision and fibromyalgia. Expert witnesses for the parties differed on the extent or existence of the causal link. 

HELD: Action allowed in part.
 The plaintiff established that the collision caused some degree of whiplash injury or re-injury that caused ongoing symptoms for six weeks. Inconsistencies with the plaintiff's evidence regarding her pre-accident health were overcome by consistencies in the medical evidence. The plaintiff established that she had fibromyalgia, but failed to establish that her condition was caused by the collision with the defendant. The plaintiff's expert evidence did not sufficiently address the cause of her condition. To the extent that a causal link was stated in the plaintiff's expert evidence, it was undermined by the plaintiff's failure to accurately report her medical history to the expert. In addition, the plaintiff's development of fibromyalgia was not within six months of the collision as was typically the case where trauma was the suspected cause. The conclusion regarding causation was further buttressed by evidence that the plaintiff's symptoms had resolved within two months and the significant hiatus in her doctor visits during a critical post-collision period. The plaintiff was awarded general damages of <damage type = "general">$6,000</damage> and special damages of <damage type = "special">$120</damage>. Her remaining claims were dismissed.

Reasons for Judgment
L.W. BERNARD J.
A. Overview
1  On April 24, 2007, the parties were involved in a low-impact motor vehicle collision; the defendant "rear-ended" the plaintiff. He has admitted his liability for this act.
2  The principal issues in dispute relate to the extent of the personal injuries caused by the defendant. The plaintiff claims that she sustained whiplash injuries which evolved into fibromyalgia: the debilitating condition which is the foundation for her significant damages claim. The essence of the defendant's position is that the plaintiff has failed to prove the necessary causal link between the collision and fibromyalgia.
B. Evidentiary Synopsis
The Collision
3  The collision occurred at approximately 8:00 a.m., at the intersection of 88th Avenue and Fraser Highway, in Surrey, B.C. The parties were the sole occupants of their respective vehicles. The plaintiff, Ms Anderson, was turning right onto Fraser Highway from 88th Avenue when her vehicle, a Toyota Forerunner, was struck from behind by the defendant's vehicle, a Honda Civic. Ms Anderson and the defendant, Mr. Minhas, were travelling the same route and, just prior to the collision, Mr. Minhas had stopped behind Ms Anderson, to wait for her to move forward and merge onto Fraser Highway. As Ms Anderson began to merge, Mr. Minhas followed; however, Ms Anderson braked unexpectedly and the Civic's front bumper struck the trailer hitch of the Forerunner.
4  Mr. Minhas estimated that he had moved forward approximately ten feet from a stationary position when his vehicle struck the Forerunner. He described the impact as minor; one which did not cause the Forerunner to be pushed forward.
5  After the collision the parties drove into a nearby parking lot to inspect for damage and to exchange information. It was noted that the impact caused no damage to the Forerunner and that the Civic sustained a small circular indentation to its front bumper, where it came into contact with the protruding metal ball of the trailer hitch. During the information exchange Ms Anderson held her neck but made no verbal complaints. Mr. Minhas sustained no personal injuries. Both parties continued on to their respective workplaces after the short encounter.
6  Ms Anderson testified that, at the time of the collision, she was looking over her shoulder. She said that the impact forced her body forward and back, during which her chest struck the steering wheel and her head struck the headrest "hard". She said that she felt and heard her neck "crack". She said that the force of the impact caused her cigarettes and cell-phone to fly out of the centre console. She said she was immediately rendered "very dazed and confused". When questioned about whether she lost consciousness she said that she could not say with certainty that she did not; however, she recalled driving to the nearby parking lot at the suggestion of Mr. Minhas.
7  Mr. Minhas testified that the plaintiff did not appear dazed or confused during the information exchange.
8  Ms Anderson's husband, Shane Anderson, testified that he spoke to Ms Anderson shortly after the collision. He said that she informed him that she thought she lost consciousness in the collision, and that her neck had cracked.
Collision Aftermath
9  After the collision, Ms Anderson drove to the pet grooming shop where she worked as a casual employee. She carried out her duties in the morning, but she left work mid-afternoon to attend a nearby medical clinic because her neck and upper back were sore and she felt disoriented and shaken. She saw a clinic physician but nothing was prescribed for her. The next day she attended to her family physician, Dr. Dang, and she complained to him of having a sore back and neck. Dr. Dang recommended that Ms Anderson relax for a few days, take physiotherapy, and use muscle-relaxant and anti-inflammatory medications.
10  Ms Anderson followed Dr. Dang's advice but testified that throughout the balance of 2007 and beyond, she "got worse"; developing lower back pain, leg pain, hand pain, foot pain and numbness, pressure and pain on the left side of her face, blurry vision, headaches, and generalized pain throughout her body. She claims that most of these symptoms have not subsided and that she is now significantly physically disabled by the effects of fibromyalgia. More specifically, Ms Anderson said that within two weeks of the collision she was suffering from leg pains; that within a month she was suffering lower back pain; that during and after her physiotherapy treatments she suffered hand pain; that she suffered pain and tingling down her legs and into her feet within two months of the collision; that her health started to go "dramatically downhill" in the fall of 2007; and, that her headaches began approximately one year after the collision. She said that she did not report these pains to her doctor until April 2008 because she thought and understood she would recover merely with the passage of time.
11  Ms Anderson has had little success with various prescribed medicines to treat her symptoms. At present she claims to find some relief from vitamin B12 injections.
Post-collision Health
12  Sanjeev Bodwal is a physiotherapist who saw Ms Anderson on May 7, 2007 (approximately two weeks after the collision). On this date Ms Anderson complained of pain in her neck and mid-back. She reported that she was a self-employed dog-groomer who had worked "on and off since the collision, depending on her pain level". She said that she was also suffering from sleep disturbance, acid reflux, and an ulcer. He said that she described having "a chronic lumbar spine problem since the age of 12 or 13" and chronic pain in her left spine. (Ms Anderson denied that she told Mr. Bodwal that she had a chronic back problem since the age of 13. She said that she was simply relating what "a lady" had said to her when she was 13.)
13  Ms Anderson saw Mr. Bodwal for ten sessions, which ended on June 8, 2007. Ms Anderson progressed through these sessions as follows: on May 7 she reported pain with all neck movements; on May 16 she reported that her neck "felt good"; on May 18 she reported that she had "minimal" pain in her neck, but still suffered with pain in her back; on May 22 Mr. Bodwal noted 90% improvement in the cervical spine and 60% improvement in the thoracic spine; and, on May 24 Ms Anderson had no complaints. On June 8 Mr. Bodwal noted that Ms Anderson's pain was "back to pre-MVA levels" but that she continued to have "chronic spinal problems since childhood". Physiotherapy concluded and Mr. Bodwal recommended core-strength training and exercise.
14  In cross-examination, Mr. Bodwal agreed that while relapse was possible "usually patients stay better once they are better".
15  Norman Dang is Ms Anderson's family physician. He examined Ms Anderson on April 25, 2007, one day after the collision. Ms Anderson complained of neck pain radiating to her mid-back. Dr. Dang diagnosed neck and back strain, prescribed medication and recommended physiotherapy. Dr. Dang saw Ms Anderson, again, on April 30, May 14, July 13 and July 27, 2007. In this period Ms Anderson reported abdominal pain, bilateral leg cramps, and calf pain, but Dr. Dang attributed only her neck and back complaints to the collision. For example, on July 27 he believed her complaints of leg pains and cramps were related to work. He noted: "She indicated that she was working a lot."
16  Dr. Dang next saw Ms Anderson about various physical pains and complaints (other than gastroesophegeal reflux disease, ("GERD")) on April 24, 2008 (one year after the collision). At this visit she reported neck, mid-back, and lower back pain, hand stiffness, weak legs, and a lack of energy. On April 30, 2008, she complained of bilateral dysesthesia ("like being stung by a bee") in her gluteal and anterior-to-posterior legs. A CT scan of her lumbar spine showed a small disc protrusion and minimal disc bulge.
17  By July 9, 2008, Ms Anderson was complaining to Dr. Dang of suffering from hot flashes, neck and upper back pain, right forearm throbbing pain, and low energy. In September 2008 Ms Anderson reported swollen hands, bilateral blurry vision and headaches, difficulty in standing for more than five minutes, increased pain all over her legs, back and arms, and "worsening mental slowness with reduced memory and concentration". In December 2008 Ms Anderson reported left-side facial discomfort and a burning left eye. Ms Anderson was referred to a neurologist, an ophthalmologist, and a rheumatologist.
18  In cross-examination, Dr. Dang said that he was quite certain that Ms Anderson did not, until July 2008, inform him that her head and neck cracked in the collision. This information that caused him to order an MRI, which he did not do until July 2008. Of Ms Anderson's myriad complaints Dr. Dang attributed only her neck and upper back pains to the collision "because they were not there in a persistent way prior to the motor vehicle accident". He added that this diagnosis pertained to a 1.5 month period immediately post-collision; more specifically, he said "I can't, based on the physiotherapist's report, attribute these pains to the motor vehicle accident after that period."
19  Alan Yorke is a rheumatologist who examined Ms Anderson in January 2009. Dr. Yorke was the first to diagnose Ms Anderson with fibromyalgia. On examination he found Ms Anderson to have full and pain-free range of motion in her neck, with some increased pain at the suprascapular area; however, he also found positive pain responses to 12 pressure points - enough to support a fibromyalgia diagnosis. He noted that Ms Anderson's history of "atypical chest pain", GERD, and L4-5 disc protrusion was "most useful". He said that lack of restful sleep may compound a motor vehicle accident injury and lead to fibromyalgia. Dr. Yorke noted that Ms Anderson did not suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. He recommended a medication called Tradozone to help Ms Anderson sleep. When Ms Anderson said she did not wish to take this drug, Chamomile tea and over-the-counter sleep aids were recommended.
20  In cross-examination, Dr. Yorke agreed that he examined Ms Anderson only once; that the examination took 30 minutes; and, that it was not "a detailed medical assessment". He agreed that his report was incorrect when it stated that Ms Anderson was "well" before the collision; in this regard he said "the records show that this was not the case". He agreed that the records revealed similar neck and upper back pains prior to the collision, and he opined that the disc protrusion could have been the cause of Ms Anderson's pre-accident back pain, because if it had been caused by the collision then he would have expected immediate symptoms.
21  In relation to the medical condition known as fibromyalgia, Dr. Yorke stated: that the medical community does not know what causes it, but noted that some common triggers are sleep deprivation, psycho-social stress, and physical trauma; that the symptoms are musculoskeletal pains in the four quarters of the body which are not otherwise explained; that fibromyalgia often develops slowly after an event because of continued sleep disruption; and that whiplash causes internal swelling of muscles which may result in sleep deprivation.
22  In relation to a causal link between the collision and Ms Anderson's fibromyalgia, Dr. Yorke said:
I can't say that the fibromyalgia was from the MVA, or that Ms Anderson's symptoms in the fall are from the MVA - a firm diagnosis was not made until January 2009. It is a reasonable expectation that fibromyalgia symptoms will arise within six months [if the MVA is the cause].
23  Rhonda Shuckett is a rheumatologist who examined Ms Anderson on May 24, 2010. She diagnosed Ms Anderson with fibromyalgia. Dr. Shuckett found that Ms Anderson had "sleep challenges" and a positive pain response in 16 fibromyalgia tenderness points. She said it was her experience that it was not unusual for patients to evolve into fibromyalgia after a motor vehicle accident trauma; more precisely, she said "patients descend into fibromyalgia from deconditioning and lack of sleep in the aftermath".
24  In addition to fibromyalgia, Dr. Shuckett also diagnosed (1) neck and upper back injury; (2) cervicogenic headaches; (3) bilateral shoulder tendonitis; and (4) mechanical low back pain.
25  As for a causal link between the collision and Ms Anderson's diagnoses, Dr. Shuckett said:
Her diagnoses are the types of diagnoses that can be linked to a motor vehicle accident. Her symptoms came on soon after the subject MVA. It must be recognized that she had a L shoulder/shoulder girdle problem with pain taking her off work before the subject MVA. She was not working leading to the subject MVA although she says her L shoulder girdle symptoms had regressed shortly before the subject MVA. Her L shoulder girdle symptoms would have rendered her more susceptible to L neck and shoulder girdle pain following the subject MVA. It should be noted that she underwent a neck Xray March 30, 2007 some month before the subject MVA so it seems her doctor was wanting to r/o neck changes on Xray (which was normal); the L trapezius pain could have been referred from the neck. She had a remote "whiplash" while play fighting with a friend but this was about 8 years [later] [Editor's note: Text in brackets is struck out in the original.] [ago] and I do not implicate this old injury in her post MVA symptoms. She says her low back was sensitive to pressure by touch before the subject MVA and she did have a low back Xray the day before the subject MVA which makes one wonder if she had some low back symptoms at that time. She says she just wondered about her back and requested an Xray because at age 13 she was told her back would collapse on her. Her low back Xray and sacroiliac joints were said to be normal the day before the subject MVA.
I believe that the subject MVA materially contributed to all her diagnoses although I will discuss fibromyalgia separately below. Her diagnoses are the sorts of conditions that can occur in the aftermath of an MVA. However, I believe that there were predisposing symptoms which rendered her more susceptible to effects of the MVA, namely her L shoulder girdle and shoulder symptoms that had her off work and some pre existing low back tenderness which she reports to me. The current conditions are, I feel, materially contributed to by the subject MVA as well as pre MVA factors.
She was tried on anti depressants after the MVA and I cannot rule out psychosocial issues contributing to her pain and particularly her fibromyalgia syndrome. Psychosocial factors are not unusual in patients with chronic pain.
Fibromyalgia post traumatic injury is a debated topic. There are a number of published papers in the medical literature which support a relationship between injury and fibromyalgia syndrome. However there are some which counter this association. In my extensive experience dealing with fibromyalgia I find it not unusual for it to emerge in the aftermath of an injury. Theories of what co-factors may underlie evolution to fibromyalgia syndrome post injury include regional areas of pain leading to pain referral, sleep disturbance, deconditioning and psychosocial issues; I believe all of these issues are factors in her. Thus, I believe the MVA significantly materially contributed to her fibromyalgia syndrome although some pre MVA factors such as her pre MVA pains may have been operative here.
26  In cross-examination, Dr. Shuckett agreed that a patient's history - specifically, the accuracy of any pre-existing symptoms - is key to the validity of a diagnosis. In this vein, Dr. Shuckett agreed: that Ms Anderson did not inform her that she suffered from neck pain prior to the collision; that Ms Anderson did not inform her that she had attended to an emergency ward for leg pains within a month prior to the collision; that despite learning from Ms Anderson that she had been informed, at age 13, that her spine would eventually collapse, Dr. Shuckett made no further inquiries because Ms Anderson said she was not suffering from back pain; that a physiotherapist's comment indicating that Ms Anderson had returned to pre-accident pain levels as of June 8, 2007, was noteworthy (albeit not noted) and contrary to Ms Anderson's claim that she had experienced no post-accident improvement; and, that an 11-month gap in visits to Dr. Dang was noteworthy ("one would like to see more continuity").
27  Dr. Shuckett said that she did not review Ms Anderson's medical records until after the examination, in Ms Anderson's absence (as is her practice with all patients); accordingly, she had no opportunity to question Ms Anderson about any inconsistent or additional information provided. She did not elect to contact Ms Anderson thereafter.
28  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dr. Shuckett defended her opinion regarding causation, with the following comments scattered throughout her cross-examination:
Having read these comments and Dr. Telfer's report, I say that [Ms Anderson] had some chronic problems which could have put her at greater risk; however, I still believe that the MVA materially contributed to the fibromyalgia. Material contribution simply means it played some potential role. It is true that I do not know what caused the fibromyalgia. I can't say with certainty that the MVA played a role in the symptoms which developed in 2008. The injury may have placed her at greater risk; but, it is multi-factorial. It is challenging to ascertain possibility vs. probability. I believe the MVA has materially contributed; but, fibromyalgia can happen spontaneously. I can't say it is the sole causing factor. Stress can be a significant contributing factor. Poor sleep, alone, can bring it on. Psycho-social stressors can play a role.
29  In relation to the biomechanics of the collision, Dr. Shuckett stated that she was unable to say anything about the nature and effect of the impact upon Ms Anderson because she was not a biomechanical engineer; nonetheless, she testified that all aspects of the collision were germane to her assessment and opinion (hence, the full documentation of such in her report). When questioned about the relevance of the circumstances of the collision to her causation opinion, she was unable to articulate a helpful response. She conceded that most persons in low-impact "rear-ender" collisions do not develop fibromyalgia in the aftermath.
Pre-collision Health
30  Ms Anderson testified that prior to the collision she suffered from the common "everyday aches and pains" caused by daily activities. She added that she had a specific problem with her left shoulder which made it difficult for her to hold dogs while she groomed them.
31  Hospital records showed that on March 21, 2007, Ms Anderson attended to the emergency ward of the Langley Memorial Hospital for pains in her right calf. In cross-examination about this visit, Ms Anderson said she could not recall it.
32  Medical records showed that on April 23, 2007 (one day prior to the collision), Ms Anderson sought medical advice about her back and what effect it might have on bearing children, as she was contemplating pregnancy.
33  Norman Dang summarized Ms Anderson's pre-collision health as follows:
Prior to this MVA, Ms Anderson had past episodes of neck, back, and chest pain. She complained of her shoulder feeling loose and grinding during her September 18, 2006 office visit. She mentioned that she had a previous whiplash type injury from horseplay several years prior and she had been tight in the upper trapezius since but she had no persisting neck pain. One day prior to her MVA she was reviewed, concerning her shoulder assessment, by Dr. Tim King, sports medicine. She noted her pain in her legs and recurrent leg swelling. She was tender in her lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine area. XR lumbar spine was ordered on that visit.
. . . She had various neck and shoulder musculoskeletal complaints prior to the MVA, and she had a small L4-5 disc protrusion, documented on CT May 27, 2008.
34  In cross-examination, Dr. Dang agreed that Ms Anderson suffered from "ongoing chest-wall pain" prior to the collision.
35  Charles Telfer is an orthopaedic surgeon who saw Ms Anderson on March 30, 2007 (approximately three weeks prior to the collision), about a complaint of "pain in her neck going into her left scapular shoulder" for the past four years. He reported that Ms Anderson said that she was having ongoing trouble with discomfort in the base of her neck, bilaterally, but predominately to the left, radiating in towards the scapula and upper arm, without distal radiation, numbness, tingling, or other neurological symptoms.
36  Upon examination, Dr. Telfer concluded that Ms Anderson did not have any shoulder pathology and he specifically ruled out bursitis; rather, he opined that she likely suffered from soft-tissue discomfort and cervical spine-related discomfort. He noted more pain symptoms to the left side of the neck than to the right, radiating to the scapula. He found mild decreased range of motion in her neck and a little tenderness in her trapezius.
37  Dr. Telfer believed that Ms Anderson was wrongly describing her pain as emanating from the shoulder; he noted "she was pointing to the side of her neck, not her shoulder". He said that Ms Anderson attributed the neck injury to a "rough-housing" incident during which her head snapped back in a whiplash-type of mechanism: "She immediately developed lots of muscle spasm on both sides of her neck into her shoulder areas and since that time has had ongoing trouble."
38  Ms Anderson reported to Dr. Telfer that she had quit her dog-grooming job because of her pain; however, Dr. Telfer found no physiological reason for Ms Anderson not working. He said that she could manage her mild soft-tissue discomfort with over-the-counter medications, stretching, and strengthening exercises.
39  In cross-examination, Dr. Telfer agreed that Ms Anderson was probably more susceptible to a neck injury because of her prior neck injury.
40  Natalie Wade is a registered massage therapist who first saw Ms Anderson on December 15, 2006. On this date Ms Anderson reported the following: (1) "can't carry a purse"; (2) "hard time breathing"; (3) "uses anti-inflammatory gel/cream"; (4) "pain travels from left neck to left back"; (5) "whiplash three-to-four years ago"; (6) "neck-brace as a child"; and, (7) "bursitis". Ms Wade performed six massage treatments upon Ms Anderson, ending on January 4, 2007. During these treatments Ms Wade said that she felt neck tenderness in Ms Anderson, noted that her pelvis was in paradox (the two sides going in opposite directions), observed that Ms Anderson's right hip protruded more than the left hip, and believed that she had spondylolysis (one vertebra more inward than the others, causing ligamental strain around it) at T12 of her spine. In her December 30 treatment session, Ms Anderson reported incidents of lost vision, dizziness, and difficulty in breathing.
41  Sanjeev Bodwal, physiotherapist, first treated Ms Anderson on September 25, 2006 (seven months prior to the collision). On this date Ms Anderson sought treatment for "pain and grinding in the left shoulder". She reported that she was "off work, currently"; that she had suffered from chest pain since the age of 12; and, that she had, at some time in the past, torn the left-side neck muscles while playing.
42  Mr. Bodwal's first observations were that Ms Anderson's left shoulder blade was elevated and her head was forward. He found full range of motion in the neck, but pain in flexion, abduction, and extension.
43  Ms Anderson had eight therapy sessions with Mr. Bodwal, ending on October 25, 2006. At the September 28 session, Ms Anderson complained of pain behind one of her eyes, in addition to left-side neck pain. On October 20 she complained of "pinching" in the left upper back, and on October 25 she reported "limited participation in normal activities" and experiencing a "popping/rubbing" feeling.
Personal History; Employment and Leisure Pursuits
44  Ms Anderson is 29 years of age. She married Shane Anderson in November 2007, about six months after the collision. She and her husband reside in Surrey, B.C. Ms Anderson is the step-mother to her husband's two teenage children. In December 2007, Mr. Anderson injured his back and now collects a disability pension.
45  Ms Anderson left high school before completing grade 11. Her primary gainful employment (albeit casual and part-time) has been as a pet groomer. In 2004 she earned <damage type = "other">$7,976</damage>; in 2005 she earned <damage type = "other">$7,609</damage>; and, in 2006 she earned <damage type = "other">$136</damage>. In explanation for her very low income in 2006, Ms Anderson said she was a self-employed pet groomer, but "barely did anything" work-wise, in 2006.
46  Ms Anderson testified that she has, since the date of the collision, been unable to work as a pet groomer; more precisely, she said "I don't have the strength to lift and hold a dog." When she was questioned about a job resume (prepared in 2009) which claimed that she worked at Langley Dog Grooming in the years 2006-2008, Ms Anderson explained that this was a "typo" - that it should have read "2004-2005". (The resume also stated that Ms Anderson completed grade 11; an admitted falsehood.)
47  Vicki Danaz owned Langley Dog Grooming in 2007. She was Ms Anderson's employer at the time of the collision. She testified that Ms Anderson was a casual worker who was paid mostly in cash. She recalled Ms Anderson working on the day of the collision. In relation to the employment period prior to the collision, Ms Danaz said that Ms Anderson complained about back, neck and shoulder pains, and that these complaints persisted in the post-collision period. Ms Danaz testified that Ms Anderson continued to work for her throughout 2007, as a casual employee doing pet grooming. She recalled that Ms Anderson quit in early January 2008 because she was contemplating pregnancy and wanted employment which would entitle her to maternity leave benefits.
48  Trina Harris is Vicki Danaz's adult daughter (and Ms Anderson's sister-in-law). In 2007 Ms Harris worked at Waggin' Tails, a pet grooming salon owned by Ms Danaz's then husband. Ms Harris testified that Ms Anderson worked throughout 2007 as a casual employee at both Waggin' Tails and Langley Pet Grooming. She estimated that Ms Anderson worked a total of 20-30 hours per week "fairly consistently" throughout 2007.
49  Ms Harris recalled Ms Anderson on the day of the collision: she said "she was a little shaken up, spoke to ICBC, and left about 2:30 p.m." She testified that Ms Anderson continued to work for both pet grooming salons throughout the remainder of 2007. Her recollection was that Ms Anderson "took the summer off" and returned to work in September. She specifically recalled that she attended Ms Anderson's wedding in November 2007, that Ms Anderson worked during the busy 2007 Christmas season; and, that Ms Anderson quit in early 2008.
50  Ms Harris said that Ms Anderson's post-collision work complaints were no greater than those prior to the collision, when she often complained of a sore back, neck, and wrist, and of having pneumonia. Ms Harris did not observe Ms Anderson having greater difficulty performing her job after the collision.
51  In cross-examination, Ms Harris agreed that she and Ms Anderson "got into a fight" when Ms Anderson quit; however, she asserted that her evidence was truthful, that she had no interest in the outcome of the trial, and that she was upset when she learned that she might have to testify against her sister-in-law.
52  In late 2009 Ms Anderson was briefly employed as a dog groomer at Ildy's Dog Grooming Spa; however, Ms Anderson testified that she quit this job within a month because of her pains: she said "I was going home everyday crying, and cried on the way to work every morning." Ms Anderson's employer, Ildyko Novak, testified that Ms Anderson was "always sick with respiratory problems" but did not complain about pains.
53  Prior to the collision Ms Anderson enjoyed "ATV-ing" with friends, camping, "4x4-ing", hiking, swimming, playing with her step-children, and going on long walks with her husband. Since the collision she has been unable to participate in most of these activities and her aches and pains have strained her personal relationships. Ms Anderson's husband corroborated her testimony in relation to post-collision pain, the inability to participate in activities and household chores, and the negative impact the collision has had on their marital relationship. Mr. Anderson testified that he bought his wife a motorcycle in 2009 in an attempt to re-introduce some fun into her life and distract her from her pain.
The Future
54  Ms Anderson is enrolled in a training course to qualify her as a Resident Care Attendant: an occupation in which one works with persons needing, inter alia, considerable physical assistance. Ms Anderson confirmed that she was aware of the physical demands of this job when she chose it as a new career. When questioned about why she would do so she said: "I know it requires transferring patients from toilets to beds, etc., but I don't know I can't do it until I try it." Shane Anderson testified that when he discussed his wife's future job options, no consideration was given to ones less physically demanding than care attendant to the infirm.
55  Dr. Shuckett expressed reservations about whether Ms Anderson's fibromyalgia symptoms would regress in the future, given her view that they have endured for three years. She commented that vitamin B12 injections presently favoured by Ms Anderson are not a "well evidenced" form of treatment; however, she noted that Ms Anderson seems to find some relief with them. She thought Ms Anderson would have to "pace herself" in the future. She professed to be unaware of the job description of a care aide; however, she thought that assisting in the physical transfer of patients from one spot to another "would likely be challenging for [Ms Anderson]". She added: "I cannot predict whether or not she will do full time work successfully in her chosen field."
C. Findings and Analysis
Whiplash
56  The defendant has not suggested that Ms Anderson has fabricated a whiplash injury, per se. Notwithstanding that Ms Anderson is an admittedly poor historian, and that the impact from the collision was relatively minor, I am satisfied the plaintiff has proved she sustained some degree of whiplash injury, or re-injury, when the defendant's vehicle collided with hers. Whiplash injuries are a relatively common consequence of a "rear-ender" collision, and Ms Anderson's complaints and actions, proximate to the collision, are consistent with having such an injury; in particular, she held her neck at the scene of the collision, she sought immediate medical attention, she made complaints consistent with a whiplash injury, she was diagnosed with neck and back strain in the immediate aftermath of the collision; and she underwent physiotherapy for whiplash.
57  I am also satisfied that the plaintiff has proved that she suffered the effects of her whiplash injury until, at least, June 8, 2007. There is no real dispute in this regard. In this six-week post-collision period, Ms Anderson attended ten physiotherapy sessions. Mr. Bodwal, the physiotherapist who treated Ms Anderson reported that Ms Anderson responded to treatment for whiplash.
58  The period following June 8, 2007, is much more troublesome in relation to proof by the plaintiff that she continued to suffer whiplash symptoms or other ailments caused by the collision. In this regard, it is (a) the state of the plaintiff's pre-collision health and (b) the inconsistencies between the plaintiff's testimony and other evidence which loom large.
Pre-collision health
The evidence establishes that Ms Anderson had many health complaints prior to the collision; moreover, in the pre-collision period proximate to the collision, she had experienced physical pains and symptoms well beyond the "everyday aches and pains" to which she admitted.
On April 23, 2007 (one day prior to the collision), Ms Anderson attended to Dr. Dang about her shoulder and back. On this visit Ms Anderson was sufficiently concerned about her back that she asked if it might be an issue during a pregnancy. At this visit she complained of pain in her legs and recurrent leg swelling. Dr. Dang found that Ms Anderson was "tender in her lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine area" and he ordered an X-ray of her lumbar spine. Shortly prior to this doctor visit, Ms Anderson had twice (Feb. 13 and March 21, 2007) sought treatment at emergency wards; the latter for complaints of pain in her right calf.
On March 30, 2007 (25 days prior to the collision), Ms Anderson saw Dr. Telfer about ongoing neck, trapezium, and upper back pain; symptoms she attributed to a rough-housing incident, four years earlier, in which she injured her neck.
On December 15, 2006 (approximately four months prior to the collision), Ms Anderson reported various health problems and complaints to her massage therapist: "can't carry a purse", "trouble breathing", "pain traveling from left neck to left back" and "bursitis". As she had done with other health professionals, Ms Anderson indicated a history of whiplash and childhood back problems. At her December 30, 2006 treatment, Ms Anderson reported incidents of lost vision, dizziness, and difficulty in breathing. Ms Wade, the treating massage therapist, noted that Ms Anderson's pelvis was in paradox, her right hip protruded, and she had spondylolysis in her back.
In September and October 2006 physiotherapy sessions, Ms Anderson complained of left-side neck pain, pinching in her left upper back, pain behind one of her eyes, a "popping/rubbing feeling", and limitations on participating in normal activities. She reported that she had suffered chest pain since the age of 12 and had torn her neck muscles in a rough-housing incident [about four years earlier]. Mr. Bodwal, the treating physiotherapist, noted that Ms Anderson's left shoulder and shoulder blade were elevated and that her head was forward. He found neck pain with flexion, abduction, and extension.
Ms Anderson also reported aspects of her pre-collision health to Mr. Bodwal when he treated her, again, in the post-collision period. On May 7, 2007, Ms Anderson reported a pre-collision health history which included acid reflux, a stomach ulcer, and chronic lumbar spine problems and pain since the age of 12.
Inconsistencies
Ms Anderson testified that her symptoms worsened, rather than improved, during the course of her physiotherapy. This was contrary to the testimony of the physiotherapist. In the immediate post-collision period Ms Anderson said she developed lower back, leg, and hand pain but did not mention it because she thought "it was part of getting better". Mr. Bodwal testified that Ms Anderson responded positively to therapy and that she had, by June 8, recovered to her pre-collision state. When questioned about Mr. Bodwal's records, Ms Anderson did not deny that she had told Mr. Bodwal that she was "significantly better"; rather, she said that it was not true - that she said it because she "wanted the pain to stop". She was unable to explain how misleading the physiotherapist about her recovery would have helped stop her pain.
Ms Anderson testified that since the collision she has been unable to work. This is contrary to the testimony of Ms Danaz and Ms Harris who said that Ms Anderson worked as a pet groomer for Langley Dog Grooming and Waggin' Tails throughout 2007. It was also contrary to the notations of Mr. Bodwal, Dr. Dang, and a physician named Marcia Prest in clinical visits in the 2007 post-collision period of 2007. In relation to the doctors' notes Ms Anderson explained that each must have misunderstood her. Finally, Ms Anderson's own work resume reported that she worked at Langley Dog Grooming from 2006 to 2008, and her explanation that both dates were typographical errors was less than convincing.
On Ms Anderson's first visit to Dr. Dang after the collision, Dr. Dang made note of the collision circumstances as related by Ms Anderson. In relation to the impact he noted that she was rear-ended; that her head struck the headrest; and that there was no loss of consciousness. At trial Ms Anderson testified to a much more dramatic event; one in which her chest struck the steering wheel, her head struck the headrest "hard"; her head and neck cracked, and she may have lost consciousness. Dr. Dang testified that Ms Anderson first advised him that she experienced a cracking sensation in her head and neck one year after the collision. Ms Anderson agreed that she did not "mention" the head and neck cracking to Dr. Dang until this time, and she offered no reasonable explanation for such a significant omission. It is noteworthy that if Mr. Anderson's testimony is correct then Ms Anderson was well aware of the cracking and her suspected loss of consciousness immediately after the collision, yet she failed to mention it to her doctor the next day, or at any time in the ensuing year.
Ms Anderson claims that there was no hiatus in her symptoms after the collision, despite a lengthy gap between doctor visits (from July 14, 2007, to February 25, 2008). On February 25, 2008, she saw Dr. Dang only for GERD complaints. On April 24, 2008, she complained of neck and back pain and other symptoms. In her testimony Ms Anderson claimed that she developed back, leg and hand pain, and tingling in her feet within two months of the collision. She said that the onset of "entire body" pain started very soon after the collision; however, she was unable to be specific about the timing and explained that she did not report it because she thought it would "go away" - that it was "all part of getting better".
59  Where the evidence of Ms Anderson is at variation with that of the aforementioned health professionals, I accept their testimony as accurate and truthful. As previously noted, the plaintiff concedes that Ms Anderson is a poor historian; moreover, there is considerable consistency among the medical professionals in relation to Ms Anderson's pre-collision health.
60  I am satisfied that the reliable evidence establishes that at the time of the collision Ms Anderson was suffering from: (a) chronic back problems; (b) chronic neck and back pain; (c) chronic chest pain with attendant breathing difficulties; and (d) periodic severe leg pains. It also shows that Ms Anderson had relatively recent incidents of leg swelling, blurry vision, and dizziness, and a history of GERD and a stomach ulcer.
61  In relation to the question of whether Ms Anderson continued to work after the collision, the preponderant evidence is that she did so, and in a similar fashion to before the collision. Her employer and a co-worker gave convincing testimony in this regard; moreover, Ms Anderson's own statements to various medical professionals and in her employment resume suggested that this was so.
62  In relation to the collision's immediate effect upon her, I find Ms Anderson's trial version quite troubling. It is inconsistent with the account she gave the day following the collision to her family physician; in particular, she did not report that her head and neck cracked or that she thought she might have lost consciousness. Shane Anderson's testimony that Ms Anderson said these very things to him on the day of the collision is similarly vexing; it suggests, regrettably, that he may be stretching the truth to assist his wife in her claim. I am satisfied that the impact from this very minor collision was relatively slight: consistent with the version Ms Anderson related to her physician the day following the collision and not with that given at trial.
Fibromyalgia
63  It falls to the plaintiff to prove not only that she has fibromyalgia, but also that it was caused by the collision. In relation to the former, I am so satisfied.
64  The plaintiff tendered the opinions of two rheumatologists, Drs. Yorke and Shuckett, who examined Ms Anderson and tested her for fibromyalgia. Each formed the opinion that Ms Anderson has this unfortunate medical condition. No evidence of a contrary expert opinion was tendered. A diagnosis of fibromyalgia is well within the expertise of Drs. Yorke and Shuckett; there was no suggestion otherwise. On January 28, 2009, Dr. Yorke tested Ms Anderson and found "a total fibromyalgia positive score of 12/18 (a minimum of 11 responses are required to support the diagnosis)". Dr. Shuckett examined Ms Anderson on May 24, 2010, and found "she had 16-18 out of 18 painful fibromyalgia tender points distributed in all four quadrants of the body".
65  The more challenging evidentiary hurdle for the plaintiff is proof of a causal link between her fibromyalgia and the defendant's negligent act. In this regard, I must conclude that the plaintiff has failed.
66  Dr. Yorke did not address the cause of the plaintiff's fibromyalgia in his report, and in his testimony he was unable to say that Ms Anderson's fibromyalgia was caused by the collision. In relation to the cause(s) of fibromyalgia, generally, Dr. Yorke said that the medical community does not know what causes it. He said that in cases where trauma is the suspected cause, it is reasonable to expect that symptoms of fibromyalgia will develop within six months. Dr. Yorke was questioned about the cause of Ms Anderson's fibromyalgia, as follows:
 Q:  You believe that she recovered from her accident injuries within two-to-three months? 
 A:  She was substantially better two-to-three months afterwards, yes. 
 Q:  Okay, and the flare-up of complaints months later is - you cannot attribute that to the accident? 
 A:  Um, I don't know why her complaints began later. There may have been other circumstances in her life. There may be other events that - that are attributable to that worsening; but, no, I don't attribute those to the accident. 
67  Dr. Shuckett specifically addressed causation in her report, and wrote: "I believe the MVA significantly materially contributed to [Ms Anderson's] fibromyalgia syndrome, although some pre MVA factors such as her pre MVA pains may have been operative here." In cross-examination, Dr. Shuckett said that her words "materially contributed" meant "played some potential role".
68  Dr. Shuckett testified that a patient's history is key to the diagnosis, and she described Ms Anderson as "a clear and bright historian"; however, when several apparent inconsistencies and omissions in Ms Anderson's stated history were brought to Dr. Shuckett's attention, she agreed that they were relevant and noteworthy. Dr. Shuckett then revised her description of Ms Anderson to one of "pretty fluent historian, whether everything was correct or not". Dr. Shuckett stated that it was her practice not to read medical histories until after her examination. In this instance, Dr. Shuckett failed, post-examination, to identify relevant inconsistencies and accepted Ms Anderson's selective oral history as the primary foundation for her reported opinions. For example, Dr. Shuckett agreed that Ms Anderson did not inform her that she had neck or back pain before the collision; or, that she had leg pains the day before the collision; or, that she had attended to the emergency ward in relation to leg pain within the month prior to the collision.
69  Dr. Shuckett agreed that it was noteworthy that Ms Anderson's physiotherapy records for June 8, 2007, stated she was "back to pre-MVA levels" whereas Ms Anderson informed her that she had experienced no improvement with physiotherapy. She was not aware of this inconsistency when she wrote her report. Dr. Shuckett knew that Ms Anderson was told, at age 13, that her spine would eventually collapse; however, Dr. Shuckett did not question this rather alarming historical prognosis. Similarly surprising was Dr. Shuckett's failure to question Ms Anderson's plans to become a care aide, given her diagnosis and prognosis. When Dr. Shuckett's attention was drawn to the protracted gap in doctor visits in 2007-2008, Dr. Shuckett agreed that it was noteworthy and said "one would like to see more continuity".
70  In addition to the foregoing which, collectively, significantly undermines Dr. Shuckett's opinions, she was unable to articulate why she believed that the collision, given its very minor nature, "significantly materially contributed" to Ms Anderson's fibromyalgia. On the one hand she asserted that it was "very important to document all aspects of the MVA"; on the other, she said "I can't say anything about the importance of impact - I am not a biomechanical engineer."
Test for causation
71  The test for causation is succinctly stated in Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke, , by McLachlin C.J.C., delivering the judgment of the Court:
[21] First, the basic test for determining causation remains the "but for" test. This applies to multi-cause injuries. The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that "but for" the negligent act or omission of each defendant, the injury would not have occurred. Having done this, contributory negligence may be apportioned, as permitted by statute.
22 This fundamental rule has never been displaced and remains the primary test for causation in negligence actions. As stated in Athey v. Leonati, , at para. 14, per Major J., "[t]he general, but not conclusive, test for causation is the 'but for' test, which requires the plaintiff to show that the injury would not have occurred but for the negligence of the defendant." Similarly, as I noted in Blackwater v. Plint, , at para. 78, "[t]he rules of causation consider generally whether 'but for' the defendant's acts, the plaintiff's damages would have been incurred on a balance of probabilities."
23 The "but for" test recognizes that compensation for negligent conduct should only be made "where a substantial connection between the injury and defendant's conduct" is present. It ensures that a defendant will not be held liable for the plaintiff's injuries where they "may very well be due to factors unconnected to the defendant and not the fault of anyone": Snell v. Farrell, , at p. 327, per Sopinka J.
24 However, in special circumstances, the law has recognized exceptions to the basic "but for" test, and applied a "material contribution" test. Broadly speaking, the cases in which the "material contribution" test is properly applied involve two requirements.
25 First, it must be impossible for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant's negligence caused the plaintiff's injury using the "but for" test. The impossibility must be due to factors that are outside of the plaintiff's control; for example, current limits of scientific knowledge. Second, it must be clear that the defendant breached a duty of care owed to the plaintiff, thereby exposing the plaintiff to an unreasonable risk of injury, and the plaintiff must have suffered that form of injury. In other words, the plaintiff's injury must fall within the ambit of the risk created by the defendant's breach. In those exceptional cases where these two requirements are satisfied, liability may be imposed, even though the "but for" test is not satisfied, because it would offend basic notions of fairness and justice to deny liability by applying a "but for" approach.
26 These two requirements are helpful in defining the situations in which an exception to the "but for" approach ought to be permitted. Without dealing exhaustively with the jurisprudence, a few examples may assist in demonstrating the twin principles just asserted.
27 One situation requiring an exception to the "but for" test is the situation where it is impossible to say which of two tortious sources caused the injury, as where two shots are carelessly fired at the victim, but it is impossible to say which shot injured him: Cook v. Lewis, . Provided that it is established that each of the defendants carelessly or negligently created an unreasonable risk of that type of injury that the plaintiff in fact suffered (i.e. carelessly or negligently fired a shot that could have caused the injury), a material contribution test may be appropriately applied.
28 A second situation requiring an exception to the "but for" test may be where it is impossible to prove what a particular person in the causal chain would have done had the defendant not committed a negligent act or omission, thus breaking the "but for" chain of causation. For example, although there was no need to rely on the "material contribution" test in Walker Estate v. York Finch Hospital, , this Court indicated that it could be used where it was impossible to prove that the donor whose tainted blood infected the plaintiff would not have given blood if the defendant had properly warned him against donating blood. Once again, the impossibility of establishing causation and the element of injury-related risk created by the defendant are central.
72  Recently, the "but for" test was re-affirmed in Clements (Litigation guardian of) v. Clements, . Frankel J.A., delivering the judgment of the court said:
47 Although the discussion of the material-contribution test in Resurfice Corp. is obiter dicta -- the appeal was allowed on the basis that the Court of Appeal should not have interfered with the finding of the trial judge that the manner in which the plaintiff was injured was not reasonably foreseeable -- the Supreme Court of Canada clearly intended to provide guidance with respect to the issue of causation. Accordingly, what it said must be accepted as authoritative in that regard: Reilly v. Canada (Attorney General), ,  at paras. 69, 70, applying R. v. Henry, , .
48 However, I do not read Resurfice Corp. as supporting resort to the material-contribution test whenever a defendant's negligence has materially increased a plaintiff's risk of injury and it is impossible for the plaintiff to prove that that negligence was a factual cause of the injury. To do so would substantially alter the existing law and would have the effect of displacing but-for as the primary test for determining causation. It is only in exceptional circumstances that resort to the material-contribution test will, as a matter of policy, be appropriate.
49 It is important to keep in mind that in Resurfice Corp., the Court was not purporting to change the law but, rather, was reaffirming existing principles. This is evinced by the fact that McLachlin C.J. referred to two of the Court's previous decisions as examples of when the material-contribution test could properly be used to find causation.
73  Having regard to the foregoing and the issues raised by the circumstances herein, I must conclude that the case at bar is not one for which the "but for" test is unworkable, and for which resort to the "material contribution" is appropriate, as if it were available as a mere alternative if proof of causation failed on application of the "but for" test.
74  Applying, then, the "but for" test, I conclude that the evidence falls far short of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that but for the negligence of the defendant, Ms Anderson would not have developed fibromyalgia. In reaching this conclusion I take into account, inter alia, the absence of convincing medical opinion in this regard, the minor nature of the collision, the absence of credible evidence of a temporal nexus between the collision and the onset of symptoms, the reliable evidence of the plaintiff's return to her pre-collision state within two months of the collision, the chronic and acute pre-collision health complaints of the plaintiff, and the significant hiatus in doctor visits in a critical post-collision period.
D. Damages
75  The plaintiff suffered a whiplash injury in the collision. The evidence suggests that it was most likely an exacerbation of an existing complaint. Shortly after the injury she began a course of physiotherapy. Reliable evidence in this regard shows that she responded well to treatment and was substantially recovered within six weeks. The defendant submits that the injuries, or any exacerbation of a pre-existing injury, attributable to the defendant were fully resolved within three months, at most. I agree. A generous view of the evidence establishes, at most, a three-month period to full recovery to Ms Anderson's pre-collision state. The plaintiff's losses must be assessed accordingly.
Non-pecuniary
76  The defendant submits that the appropriate range for non-pecuniary damages is <damage type = "other">$2,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$5,000</damage>. In support of this position, the defendant cites: Kain v. Kirkman,  (B.C.S.C.), (<damage type = "other">$6,000</damage>); Mohammed v. Rai,  (B.C.S.C.), (<damage type = "other">$3,000</damage> and <damage type = "other">$5,000</damage>); Bagasbas v. Atwal,  (B.C.S.C.), (<damage type = "other">$3,500</damage>); Knauff v. Gower,  (B.C.P.C.), (<damage type = "other">$1,500</damage>); and, Siddoo v. Michael,  (B.C.P.C.), (<damage type = "other">$1,500</damage>).
77  The plaintiff submits that the appropriate range is <damage type = "other">$40,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$90,000</damage>, and cited several cases in support thereof; however, her position rested upon a trial finding that the defendant caused Ms Anderson's fibromyalgia and such was not the outcome.
78  In assessing the non-pecuniary damages for Ms Anderson, I am unable to distinguish her losses from the ordinary sort of losses most suffer from a minor whiplash injury. I am, however, satisfied that the plaintiff was more fragile than many others would have been at the time of the collision and that, therefore, her post-collision aches and pains may well have been greater than those experienced by an otherwise strong and healthy person. I am satisfied that Ms Anderson's life was negatively affected by the injury, or re-injury, and that during the three-month recovery period her relationships suffered to some degree, she endured some pain and discomfort, she lost some sleep, she opted out of some leisure and sport activities, and she was put to various inconveniences. For this three-month period of pain and suffering, with due regard to the cases cited, I assess her damages at <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$6,000</damage>. Any lost homemaking capacity in this period is subsumed into this award.
Special
79  The plaintiff claims <damage type = "other">$206.91</damage> for various medications, <damage type = "sub-special">$120</damage> for physiotherapy "user fees", and <damage type = "other">$49.90</damage> for a Guildford gym pass. The defendant opposes these claims, other than the physiotherapy user fees, on the basis that they are unrelated to the injury caused by the collision.
80  In proof of the pharmaceuticals claim the plaintiff tendered a pharmacy invoice; however, for the three-month period in question (April 24-July 24, 2007) the only pharmaceuticals purchased were birth control pills. Similarly, the record of payments for a gym pass shows no payments related to the period in question - they do not commence until August 17, 2007. The evidence does not, therefore, support the opposed claims. Special damages are fixed at <damage type = "special">$120</damage>.
Past Income Loss
81  The plaintiff has failed to prove that she suffered income loss in the three-month period in question. In relation to post-collision employment, the evidence of Ms Anderson is unreliable. It is inconsistent with her resume and her statements to several medical professionals, and contrary to the testimony of Ms Danaz and Ms Harris, who said that Ms Anderson's employment was unaffected by the collision. For these reasons, the claim for past income loss is dismissed.
Future Losses/Costs
82  These claims were premised upon Ms Anderson proving that fibromyalgia, which rendered her partially disabled, was caused by the defendant. For reasons given, she has failed to do so. The evidence establishes that Ms Anderson returned to her pre-collision state (albeit a compromised one) within three months of the collision; accordingly, these claims are dismissed.
E. Disposition
83  The plaintiff's claims for non-pecuniary damages (<damage type = "non-pecuniary">$6,000</damage>) and special damages (<damage type = "special">$120</damage>) are allowed; the remaining damages claims are dismissed. If the parties are unable to resolve the issue of costs then they may submit written argument.

Action for injuries suffered in a 2006 motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff was struck on a crosswalk while the defendant was making a right hand turn on a red light. The plaintiff claimed that he sustained injuries to his left arm and left knee as well as to his neck and back. The defendant argued that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent in the occurrence of the collision and that he had not established a basis that would entitle him to receive any damages other than a most minimal award. The plaintiff missed one day of work as a consequence of the injury. He said that he experienced substantial difficulty in performing his work for three weeks, and that his ability to do household chores was adversely impacted for a considerable time. He also alleged his ability to jog and exercise was severely impacted. He claimed the primary symptoms resolved over 18 months, and there was reducing intermittent low back discomfort since that time. In his submission, an appropriate award for non-pecuniary damages was <damage type = "other">$30,000</damage>. 

HELD: Action allowed in part.
 The defendant was solely liable for the accident. It was more likely than not that a walk signal was displayed when the plaintiff stepped off the sidewalk and into the crosswalk. The plaintiff was inside the marked crosswalk area at the time contact was made by the defendant's automobile. The defendant failed to ensure that his turn could be made safely by turning his attention to traffic coming from the left rather than to ensure that there was no pedestrian in the crosswalk. The plaintiff was properly entitled to cross in front of the defendant's car. The court was concerned with the veracity of the plaintiff's claims regarding the extent, severity and effects of the injuries he suffered. There was no notable objective evidence to support his assertions of the quite extensive nature of the consequences. There was some soft tissue injury, bruising and discomfort, but it was fairly minor in that he was able to resume his running within a month. While there might have been some lingering residual discomfort, it was of a fairly modest magnitude. The plaintiff was awarded non-pecuniary damages of <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$4,000</damage> and <damage type = "special">$500</damage> for part of the chiropractor costs incurred. The court did not accept that all of the costs incurred were required as a result of the injuries suffered in the accident.

Reasons for Judgment
J.W. WILLIAMS J.
1   The plaintiff Mr. Berenjian brings this action to recover damages from the driver of an automobile which struck him and, he says, injured him.
Background Circumstances
2  At time of trial, Mr. Berenjian was 54 years of age; he was 48 years old when the accident occurred.
3  At, or shortly after, 6:00 p.m. on April 5, 2006, the plaintiff was on foot and travelling northbound on the sidewalk adjacent to Taylor Way in West Vancouver. He arrived at the intersection where Keith Road intersects with Taylor Way. He began to cross Keith Road, walking in the marked crosswalk.
4  An automobile owned by the defendant John Paul Primus and driven by his son Andrew Primus was at the corner. Andrew Primus was in the process of turning right from Keith Road onto Taylor Way, with the intention of heading southbound. The light was green for traffic travelling northbound and southbound on Taylor Way and was red for traffic on Keith Road. Nevertheless, Andrew Primus was lawfully permitted to turn right on the red light, so long as that turn could be made in safety. In fact, in the matter at bar, it is apparent that Andrew Primus moved his vehicle forward, into that right turn, at a time when the plaintiff was in front of the vehicle. Contact was made.
5  Following the collision, Andrew Primus pulled his vehicle over and spoke with the plaintiff. The plaintiff pulled himself together and after some time had passed was transported to his nearby home by two persons who were witnesses to the event.
6  The plaintiff claims that he sustained injuries to his left arm and left knee as well as to his neck and back.
7  He brings this action to recover damages for the injuries and the effect they had upon him.
Positions of the Parties
8  The plaintiff says that he was lawfully in the intersection, crossing on a light displaying a walk sign, when he was struck. He says that he sustained a number of injuries; some of those resolved quickly, others took some considerable time to resolve. He says that those injuries caused him pain and suffering, and interfered with a number of his ordinary activities.
9  He seeks to recover damages accordingly.
10  The defendants concede that the automobile struck the plaintiff in the course of negotiating the right turn. The defendants challenges the proposition that the plaintiff was in the intersection on a walk signal, and says as well that the plaintiff was careless in the manner in which he attempted to cross the street. The defendants also say that the extent of the injuries was minor, so minor as to amount to virtually nothing. He disputes the plaintiff's contention that the injuries were of any moment or that they actually caused him any pain and suffering or impacted upon his ordinary activities.
11  In short, the defendants say that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent in the occurrence of the collision and that he has not established a basis that would entitle him to receive any damages other than a most minimal award.
Discussion
12  There were three witnesses at trial able to testify with respect to the manner in which the collision occurred: the plaintiff, the defendant Andrew Primus, and a person who was in another automobile at the scene and who observed the events, Ms. Williams.
13  The plaintiff has testified about his injuries; he also adduces in support the evidence of two medical professionals, a general practitioner and a chiropractor who treated him.
14  In advancing their position, the defendants rely upon their own evidence as well as that of an ICBC adjuster who had dealings with the plaintiff after the event, and the testimony of Dr. Leith, an orthopaedic surgeon. The defendants have also tendered video evidence of certain activities of the plaintiff in the time period following the event.
15  I propose to deal with the matter under three separate headings:
collision and liability;
injuries and consequences;
damages.
Collision and Liability
16  The evidence establishes to my satisfaction that, at the time the automobile struck the plaintiff, he (the plaintiff) was in the crosswalk at the intersection. It is also beyond dispute that the light for northbound and southbound vehicular traffic on Taylor Way was green.
17  There was controversy at trial as to whether the plaintiff stepped into the intersection when he had the benefit of a walk light for his crossing, or whether the light was stale and a "don't walk" signal was being displayed.
18  The only direct evidence on that point comes from the plaintiff. He says that when he stepped off the sidewalk, there was a walk signal displayed. Based upon some concerns I have of the complete accuracy of his description of events at the intersection, including the presence of other vehicles and pedestrians, I am not without some reservations as to the correctness of his description and particularly with respect to the signal. Nevertheless, the other witnesses are not in a position to dispute that there was a walk signal displayed; the most that can be said is that the state of the light at that intersection was probably somewhat stale at the time. I should note that there is no evidence before this Court that would indicate whether the walk signal at the intersection is triggered by the action of a pedestrian wishing to cross the street, or whether the walk signal is displayed as part of the green light cycle for north-south traffic.
19  In the circumstances, recognizing that the standard to be met is one of a balance of probabilities, I conclude it is more likely than not that a walk signal was displayed when the plaintiff stepped off the sidewalk and into the crosswalk.
20  I conclude as well that the plaintiff was inside the marked crosswalk area at the time contact was made by the defendants' automobile.
21  The defence also submits that there is reason to conclude that the plaintiff was not paying sufficient attention to other traffic at the time he was crossing Keith Road. That contention is based primarily upon video evidence which has been tendered, showing the plaintiff running from his place of work in downtown Vancouver to his residence in West Vancouver. The defendants note that he appears to ordinarily run with some sort of a jacket hood on his head and that compromises his ability to see all his surroundings, and, as well, that he appears in the videos to have a tendency to cross roads even though no walk signal is displayed.
22  I have taken those factors into consideration, but cannot find a basis to extrapolate from those rather general suggestions to a conclusion that the plaintiff was not taking sufficient care as he crossed the street.
23  The core submission advanced by the defendants with respect to liability, as set out in their submissions, is as follows:
Mr. Berenjian breached the standard of care of a reasonable person and did not pay sufficient attention to see the danger and crossed without adequately looking. Certainly, he admits failing to look to his left but that appears as more as [sic] an example of general carelessness on the plaintiff's part than the relevant breach in the case at hand: here, the Primus vehicle was directly ahead of the plaintiff and bright yellow to boot. It was there to be seen but the plaintiff failed to see it.
The plaintiff proceeded presumably at a fast walk or slow jog in front of the defendant's vehicle and, only too late, noticed it. He took some evasive steps, but, by this time, it was too late. He had already put himself in front of a vehicle that was moving forward with a driver not looking ahead.
24  The plaintiff's position is that he was lawfully in an intersection and that the defendant driver was turning right in the face of a red light. He contends that a driver in such a situation has a clear statutory duty not to move into his turn until it can be done in safety.
25  The defendants agree that the driver has a greater duty of care than the pedestrian, but urge the Court to find contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, something in the order of 40%.
26  In my view, the defendants' position cannot succeed.
27  The relevant statutory provisions from the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 318, are as follows:
Pedestrian controls
132 (1) When the word "walk" or an outline of a walking person is exhibited at an intersection by a pedestrian traffic control signal, a pedestrian may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal in a marked or unmarked crosswalk and has the right of way over all vehicles in the intersection or any adjacent crosswalk.
When the word "walk" or an outline of a walking person is exhibited at a place other than an intersection by a pedestrian traffic control signal, a pedestrian may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal and has the right of way over all vehicles.
When the word "wait", the words "don't walk" or an outline of a raised hand are exhibited at an intersection or at a place other than an intersection by a pedestrian traffic control signal,
a pedestrian must not enter the roadway, and
a pedestrian proceeding across the roadway and facing the word "wait", the words "don't walk", or an outline of a raised hand exhibited after he or she entered the roadway
must proceed to the sidewalk as quickly as possible, and
has the right of way for that purpose over all vehicles.
...
Red light
129 (1) Subject to subsection (2), when a red light alone is exhibited at an intersection by a traffic control signal, the driver of a vehicle approaching the intersection and facing the red light must cause it to stop before entering the marked crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no marked crosswalk, before entering the intersection, and subject to the provisions of subsection (3), must not cause the vehicle to proceed until a traffic control signal instructs the driver that he or she is permitted to do so.
The driver of a bus approaching an intersection and facing a red light and a prescribed white rectangular indicator may cause the bus to proceed through the intersection.
Despite subsection (1), and except when a right turn permitted by this subsection is prohibited by a sign at an intersection, the driver of a vehicle facing the red light, and which in obedience to it is stopped as closely as practicable to a marked crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no marked crosswalk, as closely as practicable to the intersection, may cause the vehicle to make a right turn, but the driver must yield the right of way to all pedestrians and vehicles lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection.
...
Careless driving prohibited
144 (1) A person must not drive a motor vehicle on a highway
without due care and attention,
without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway, ...
28  I have found on the appropriate standard of proof that the plaintiff was lawfully in the intersection, crossing as a pedestrian. I am also quite satisfied that the defendant Andrew Primus was principally concerned with being able to turn from Keith Road onto Taylor Way in safety, and that the focus of his attention was the state of the traffic travelling southbound on Taylor Way. As a result, he was not sufficiently aware of what was happening immediately in front of his car and to his right.
29  While it is understandable that he would be concerned with the state of the traffic coming from the left, the fact remains that he was obliged to ensure that there was no pedestrian in the crosswalk, and he failed to do so.
30  I have been referred to the decision of Grist J. in MacKnight v. Nast, . That case which involved the plaintiff, a pedestrian, being struck by a bicycle, while she was in a crosswalk, is factually dissimilar.
31  There, the plaintiff was in a marked crosswalk and had actuated the traffic signals. The automobile traffic had come to a stop. The defendant was riding his bicycle on the right-hand side of the road; he passed the stopped cars and rode into the crosswalk at speed. He saw the plaintiff at the last minute, but was unable to stop and struck her.
32  The Court was invited to find contributory negligence on the basis that, even though the plaintiff was lawfully crossing the street, she was under an obligation to take reasonable care for her own safety, notwithstanding the right of way, and so some measure of responsibility should be allocated to her.
33  Grist J. proceeded from the proposition that contributory negligence, which is based on an obligation to take reasonable care for one's own safety, depends on the foreseeability of the risk presented by the defendant's negligence. In those circumstances, where the plaintiff was in a marked crosswalk, with the traffic control signals functioning and the automobiles having stopped, he concluded it was not reasonably foreseeable that the defendant would disregard the signal and proceed at a significant rate of speed in the space between three stopped vehicles and the curb. To find contributory negligence would "stretch the obligation of reasonable foresight too far".
34  In the present case, it is my view that the principle applies in a similar way. The plaintiff was crossing the street, in a crosswalk and with a walk signal being displayed. The defendants' vehicle was stopped and facing a red light. In those circumstances, the plaintiff was properly entitled to cross in front of the car. I do not accept that a pedestrian in such a situation should be expected to reasonably foresee that the driver of the vehicle will make his turn without taking proper care to ensure he can do so in safety.
35  In the result, I conclude that the defendant Andrew Primus is liable for the collision and that there is no basis to find contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.
The Plaintiff's Injuries and Consequences
36  The plaintiff says that as the defendants' automobile moved forward and toward him, he held out his arm to catch the driver's attention. Nevertheless, the automobile struck him on the left side.
37  I am satisfied that the vehicle was not moving at a high rate of speed when the contact occurred. It would appear that Andrew Primus had been inching forward as he waited for his opportunity to turn right. He evidently identified what he thought to be an appropriate break in the traffic and began to move into his right-hand turn. He testified that he was just in the process of releasing the clutch at about the time the contact was made.
38  The plaintiff describes the point of contact as his left knee and leg and his left hand. He says that he was knocked partially off of his feet but managed to scramble up. He also says that he subsequently experienced substantial pain in his neck, accompanied by headache, and in his low back area.
39  He attended upon his family doctor the day following and then saw the doctor again for the injuries on one further occasion, that is, on April 10, 2006. On the occasion of the first visit, the doctor prescribed a semi-narcotic analgesic for pain relief. He also recommended that the plaintiff attend physiotherapy and suggested that an over-the-counter pain medication as well as icing would be appropriate for the treatment of ongoing pain.
40  The plaintiff made two attendances on a physiotherapist; there are no records of that treatment or outcome in evidence.
41  In addition, the plaintiff began a course of treatment with a chiropractor, Dr. Wright. He first saw her on May 27, 2006 and then subsequently on 17 separate subsequent occasions. Initially, the visits were quite frequent; in the first two months, he saw Dr. Wright nine different times. The frequency of the visits diminished over time. His last attendance was January 13 of 2007.
42  The plaintiff's description of the injuries and their duration and effect is as follows:
Left knee: he says the knee was bruised; he treated the injury with ice and the pain was resolved within one week.
His left arm: he says for the first five to seven days, he was unable to lift his hand over his shoulder. That situation improved with the chiropractic treatment and by June of 2007, it was substantially resolved. There was lingering discomfort through the end of the year.
Neck: the plaintiff says that he had significant neck discomfort for the first six months; it largely resolved within 12 months of the incident, and was completely cleared up 18 months after the accident. His headaches had resolved within six to eight months.
Low back: the plaintiff says that his back was 75-80% recovered by the summer of 2007. He also says that recovery was virtually complete following that, so long as he maintained an exercise program. He described lingering discomfort when he failed to be active.
43  In terms of the effect upon his everyday life, the plaintiff missed one day of work as a consequence of the injury. He said that he experienced substantial difficulty in performing his work (tailoring of clothing) for a period of approximately three weeks, and that his ability to do household chores was adversely impacted for a considerable time. He says it took a year for him to get back to normal in that regard - cooking, cleaning, and yard work.
44  He also claims that the injury caused him considerable difficulty because it interfered with his exercise activities.
45  That has turned out to be a matter of some real contention in this case.
46  It is clear that the plaintiff is substantially dedicated to exercise and fitness. Indeed, at the time of the accident, he was in the course of jogging from his place of work in downtown Vancouver to his residence in West Vancouver. His usual practice was to run home from work four or five days per week.
47  The plaintiff says that one of the ways the injuries from the accident have impacted his routine is that, because of them, he was not able to run in the usual fashion, and it was in fact some time later that he was able to get back to his pre-accident routine. His Statement of Claim also contains the assertion that he suffered from anxiety as a result of the accident - presumably that it caused him to be afraid and traumatized by jogging in traffic. In fact, that complaint was not maintained at trial, and, at any rate, the video evidence would tend to refute such a claim.
48  The claim with respect to his jogging activities having been seriously impacted is quite robustly disputed by the defendants. They say that in fact, the plaintiff had resumed his practice of running home from work within a short time of the accident. Specifically, both Andrew Primus and his father John Paul Primus describe seeing the plaintiff, dressed similarly to how he had been attired at the time of the accident, at the intersection of Marine Drive and Taylor Way. They described him as "apparently jogging"; at the specific point they saw him, he was awaiting a light to change in order to cross the street, and was jogging on the spot. Additionally, both of these witnesses describe observing the plaintiff running, apparently as he had been prior to the accident, within two or three weeks of the accident.
49  There is also the evidence of the ICBC adjuster. She testified about having two meetings with the plaintiff. The first was on April 11, 2006, just eight days after the accident, when she observed that he was moving slowly and with apparent great difficulty, grimacing and mincing. She also met with him about a month later, on May 12. At that time, he told her that he was trying to walk as much as possible, that he was taking painkillers but that he was not running. He said to her: "I don't jog - I power-walk".
50  As part of its examination of the circumstances, the defence retained an investigator to observe the activities of the plaintiff. That resulted in video recordings being made; those were tendered in evidence at this trial. Those recordings show the plaintiff, on three separate occasions, leaving his downtown place of business and travelling on foot to the area of his residence in West Vancouver.
51  The first of those recordings was made on May 4. It shows the plaintiff as he slowly jogged from his place of business to his residence. On the way, he stopped and did some moderate physical exercise including push-ups. The elapsed time from his departure from his place of work to his arrival at his home was approximately 70 minutes.
52  Another recording was made the day following, May 5. Again, it shows similar activity; the elapsed time was 70 minutes.
53  The third observation was conducted on May 11. Again, the plaintiff is shown essentially jogging from his place of work to his home. The additional exercise was done along the way in the same fashion.
54  At trial, the plaintiff was confronted with this evidence, as well as testimony he had provided in the course of an examination for discovery, at a time when he was unaware of the recordings having been made. At the examination, he stated under oath that he had eased into his running gradually following the motor vehicle accident and had started running the entire distance from his place of work to his home approximately five to six months after the motor vehicle accident. He said that, post-accident, the trip would take him in the order of two hours, which he said was about 45-60 minutes longer than it had taken prior to the injury. His evidence at the examination for discovery was that his time to make the trip, prior to the motor vehicle accident, was in the order of 60-70 minutes.
55  At trial his testimony was different. He said that before the motor vehicle accident, he had been able to do the run and the en route workout in 40 minutes.
56  Quite predictably, the apparent discrepancy between these activities and the manner in which the plaintiff had represented his injuries and their effects was the basis of some real dispute at trial.
57  As I understand the position of the plaintiff, he says that he forced himself to run these distances, even though he was in considerable pain, and even though it required him to use substantial amounts of painkilling medication, because he has a deep-seated commitment to physical exercise.
58  The plaintiff also attempts to address the concern by way of what seems to me to be something of a semantic distinction. He takes the position that he was not jogging but walking quickly.
59  The defendants adduced the evidence of an orthopaedic surgeon, Dr. Leith. His testimony was taken on a video deposition and that was tendered at trial. He had rendered three separate opinions, set out in report letters. The first was dated August 28, 2008. To prepare that opinion, Dr. Leith had examined the relevant medical records and performed an in-person assessment of the plaintiff on April 14, 2008. At that time, he was not aware of the video recordings. His conclusion, assuming that the plaintiff was asymptomatic prior to the accident and that, following the accident, he had pain affecting his left knee, left upper extremity and entire back, was as follows:
There is nothing to indicate any structural injury to the lumbosacral spine or the vertebra of this area. The ongoing symptoms are primarily musculoligamentous in nature and should resolve with appropriate conservative treatment. Prognosis for recovery is good based on the minor nature of the injuries sustained and the minor nature of the ongoing symptoms. There is no indication that there will be any long-term sequelae from this or requirement for any surgery. From a functional standpoint, Mr. Berenjian continues to work although with some low back symptoms, but this is not a significant problem based on the evaluation. The overall prognosis is good.
60  Dr. Leith was subsequently provided with copies of the video recordings of the plaintiff jogging on the three occasions described above. In light of that information, he provided a revised opinion, dated July 8, 2008, quite at variance with his original. Specifically, he said there:
The observation of this video is quite compelling after re-reviewing my assessment of April 14. 2008 and the opinion of that report. My Medical Legal Report to you opined that Mr. Berenjian had injuries to his left knee, left upper extremity and his entire back and the ongoing issue at the time of my evaluation was with respect to chronic low back pain.
As a result of my review of the surveillance video, my original opinion now becomes irrelevant. Being able to jog along the route that Mr. Berenjian was observed jogging without any sign of any pain or discomfort is not consistent with having any low back disability or problems. In particular, running for the length of time that he was running on a regular basis indicates that he did not have any injuries or disability. There is a large proportion of the population that would not be able to perform this length of run over the grades encountered even 100% healthy. Mr. Berenjian reported being injured during my evaluation and not being able to do this sort of activity without difficulty yet it is clear that he was very capable of this type of activity.
I would therefore conclude that Mr. Berenjian does not have any low back pain or disability as of the dates that he was jogging, which was within one month after the subject motor vehicle accident and at the present time, whatever symptoms he is complaining of are unrelated to the subject motor vehicle accident.
61  That opinion was further refined by way of a further supplemental opinion rendered on July 28, 2008. In that opinion, Dr. Leith assumed that the plaintiff's running activities had actually commenced on April 7, 2006, not May 4.
62  That refinement was premised on the proposition that the two defendants had observed the plaintiff running on April 7, in a manner similar to that depicted in the video recordings.
63  Operating from that assumption, Dr. Leith opined that the plaintiff would not have sustained any formidable injuries as a result of the motor vehicle accident on April 5, 2006, because if he had, he would not have been able to participate in the type of physical activity depicted.
64  The response of the plaintiff, as indicated, is that he was not running in the days immediately following the event. While he accepts that the activities depicted in the video recordings are accurate, he insists that he was doing so only in the face of great pain and with the assistance of pain suppression medication.
65  In support of that position, he relies upon subsequent follow-up medical opinions prepared by the family doctor, Dr. Mamacos, and the chiropractor, Dr. Wright. Both of those persons authored opinions in response to the revised subsequent opinion of Dr. Leith.
66  Dr. Mamacos essentially stands by his original report. He says as follows:
In the video he is seen to be exercising actively - does that mean he was never injured? A lot of healing can evolve in a month. A high pain threshold can motivate someone who loves to exercise to be active. He was seen "jogging" not sprinting.
My initial report showed bruising of his knee from the accident. He also had para-vertabral muscle spasm, etc-objective findings.
... I continue to support my findings that [he] sustained injuries after an MVA on April 16, 2006.
67  Similarly, Dr. Wright stands by her conclusion that the plaintiff sustained real injuries. She notes that it is her practice to advise patients who have been injured in accidents to continue to exercise to control symptoms and facilitate recovery. She says the ability to continue in a regular exercise routine does not preclude the existence of injury. She observes as well that she had the opportunity to examine and treat the plaintiff over the course of seven months, and that she observed objective evidence of injury and concluded his symptoms are the result of the accident.
68  I am concerned with the veracity of the plaintiff's claims regarding the extent, severity and effects of the injuries he suffered. The principal basis upon which the claim rests is his testimony, his description. There is not any notable objective evidence to support his assertions of the quite extensive nature of the consequences.
69  On the other side of the ledger are three significant factors:
Firstly, the evidence of the plaintiff's physical activities in the time following the accident is troubling. The jogging activities in which he was observed to be engaged and which have been proven by the video recordings, within a month of the event, are, in my view, quite strikingly at odds with the description he has provided of the extent of the effects of the injuries.
There are as well the observations made by the defendants, even before the video recorded activities. While they are not conclusively proven by photographic evidence, in view of the videos and, noting that both defendants have testified as to observations of the plaintiff having resumed some sort of jogging routine within weeks of the event, I must attribute some credence to their testimony on that matter.
In the result, I am driven to conclude that the plaintiff was able to engage in significant physical activity within a month of the accident.
Secondly, I find his evidence with respect to the issue problematic. His testimony at trial is not consistent with what he said at his examination for discovery. Those discrepancies are set out at para. 54 above.
I also find that the representations he made to the insurance adjuster are difficult to accept as truthful in light of the video evidence. His explanation at trial, that the discrepancies are more semantic than real, and that he was forcing himself to run, taking medication to be able to keep the pain within the limits of tolerability, is, in the totality of the circumstances, of some dubious believability.
The third factor is the nature of the event: the impact was quite minor. While that is not determinative - I accept that low-speed contact can, in some circumstances, result in injuries of real gravity - it is a factor that is entitled to some consideration.
70  In the final analysis, I have very serious doubts as to the truth and reliability of the plaintiff's description of the extent of the injuries and their impact upon him. My conclusion is that there was some soft tissue injury - bruising and discomfort - but it was fairly minor in that he was able to resume his running within a month. In view of that finding, while I accept there may have been some lingering residual discomfort, it would be of a fairly modest magnitude.
71  Similarly, as for his claims that his neck pain continued for 12 to 18 months, that the headaches persisted for six to eight months, and his complaint of low back pain, I find that he has not proven on a balance of probabilities that such injuries resulted in discomfort such as he describes. On the evidence, it was substantially less.
Damages
72  The plaintiff says that he suffered soft tissue injury to his neck and back which negatively impacted his life. He says the primary symptoms resolved over 18 months, and there was reducing intermittent low back discomfort since that time. In his submission, an appropriate award for non-pecuniary damages is <damage type = "other">$30,000</damage>.
73  In support of that submission, he cites four trial decisions of this Court:
In Parihar v. Allan, , the plaintiff suffered soft tissue injury to neck and back following two minor collisions; substantial recovery in the first nine months, with intermittent symptoms for an additional six months. At trial, three years post-accident, the plaintiff reported only occasional discomfort with activity. Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "other">$25,000</damage>.
In Kahlon v. Prasad, , the plaintiff sustained soft tissue injuries after a minor collision; no time missed from employment and the symptoms had fully resolved within 14 months. Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "other">$25,000</damage>.
In Krause v. Gill, , the plaintiff sustained soft tissue injuries to the neck and back; substantial recovery within the first six months and residual pain for an additional 12 months. At trial, three years post-accident, plaintiff reported ongoing residual discomfort. Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "other">$30,000</damage>.
In White v. Stonestreet, , the plaintiff sustained soft tissue injuries to neck, shoulder and back; significant improvement noted in the first six months and all symptoms had largely resolved within an 18 month period, with some continuing residual pain. Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "other">$35,000</damage>.
74  The submission of the defendants is that this plaintiff suffered minor soft tissue injuries of very limited duration. The defendants emphasize that the plaintiff is obliged to adduce "convincing evidence" "that his complaints of pain are true reflections of a continuing injury". They say that when the evidence is considered carefully and critically, the plaintiff has not proven more than a mild, transient injury.
75  The defendants make reference to a number of decisions which are characterized as addressing modest awards for modest injuries, with the submission that each of the cases in fact describe injuries more serious than those suffered by Mr. Berenjian:
In Kosko v. Collie,  (19 September 1995), New Westminster C911774 (S.C.), the plaintiff sustained a neck injury, resolved in four months. Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "other">$4,000</damage>.
In Cooper v. Torrance, , the plaintiff sustained injuries that were described as being severe for three weeks, moderate discomfort for approximately two months thereafter and some residual symptoms. Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "other">$2,500</damage>.
In Gill v. Mansour, , the plaintiff sustained mild soft tissue injuries which continued for a period of two months and resolved with only minor discomfort after. Non pecuniary damages: <damage type = "other">$3,000</damage>.
In Laboucane v. Paine, , the plaintiff suffered a modest injury that was partially disabling for approximately one month. Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "other">$3,000</damage>.
In Seto v. Ng, , the plaintiff suffered injury that was found to have lasted for four month duration. Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "other">$2,500</damage>.
In Dolha v. Heft, , the plaintiff sustained injuries that continued for a period of approximately six to nine months. Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "other">$7,000</damage>.
76  The defendants have also made reference to a decision of the Court of Appeal, Le v. Luz, . In that case, the Court set aside a jury verdict of <damage type = "other">$200</damage> for non-pecuniary damages and substituted a verdict of <damage type = "other">$2,000</damage>. In its decision, the Court noted that while there was no intention to set a floor or a benchmark for minor soft tissue injuries, an award of <damage type = "other">$2,000</damage> seemed appropriate in the circumstances.
77  It is obvious that the two very distinctly different submissions reflect quite different views of the magnitude and consequences of the injury. My conclusions are as set out in paragraphs 70 and 71 of these Reasons.
78  In my view, the appropriate award of non-pecuniary damages in this case is <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$4,000</damage>.
79  The plaintiff also seeks an award in respect of special damages. The amount sought is <damage type = "other">$940</damage>, which is the sum paid for therapy expenses. Although there was discussion as to interest costs incurred with respect to those fees, the plaintiff's submission does not seek recovery of any interest paid.
80  Given my findings as to the extent of the injuries, I am not satisfied that all of the fees paid for chiropractic care are reflective of a genuine need for those services. In the result, the plaintiff is entitled to recover <damage type = "special">$500</damage> for those costs, representing a portion only.
81  The defendants have advanced an argument with respect to a failure to mitigate. As I understand, that is put forward as an alternative, in the event the Court finds that the plaintiff suffered more than relatively minimal soft tissue injury that resolved quite straightforwardly. Given my finding, I see no purpose in addressing this submission.
Summary of Conclusions
82  The accident of April 5, <damage type = "other">2006</damage> was caused by the negligence of the defendant driver. In that accident, the plaintiff sustained injuries which entitle him to recover damages as follows:
 Non-pecuniary damages: <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$4,000</damage> 
 Special damages: <damage type = "special">$ 500</damage> 
 Total: <damage type = "total">$4,500</damage> 
83  The plaintiff is also entitled to recover pre-judgment interest pursuant to the Court Order Interest Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 79 in respect of the special damages.
84  In the absence of there being considerations of which I am unaware, the plaintiff shall recover his costs of this action. If necessary, arrangements may be made through New Westminster Supreme Court Scheduling to provide further submissions on that issue.

Reasons for Judgment
B. BROWN J.
1   Mr. Gurdev Kumar claims against Mr. Picco and his company, Louis T. Picco Inc. (for ease of reference, I will refer to Picco and his company collectively as Mr. Picco) for negligent misrepresentation. Mr. Kumar says that the review engagement reports prepared by Mr. Picco on the financial statements of the company which Mr. Kumar planned to purchase were prepared negligently. Mr. Kumar further says that Mr. Picco negligently advised him that the purchase deposit would be adequately secured by a promissory note from the company and its principal.
2  Mr. Kumar says that as a result of these negligent misrepresentations he paid a deposit of <damage type = "other">$250,000</damage> directly to the company, secured by a promissory note from the company and its principal. When the purchase deal fell apart, the company and the principal failed to return the deposit and subsequently became bankrupt. Mr. Kumar's entitlement to the return of the deposit is not disputed in this action. Mr. Kumar seeks damages from the defendants.
I. BACKGROUND
3  In 2004, Mr. Kumar was looking for a business to purchase. His family had been involved in the automobile industry in India and he was looking for an automobile dealership to purchase in the Vancouver area. Mr. Kumar learned that the Hyundai dealership in Burnaby may be for sale and he and his son, Karun Kumar, met with Mr. Pellegrino, the principal of the business. Mr. Pellegrino's company, Adriano's Performance Imports Inc. ("API") owned the operating business for the dealership. Another one of Mr. Pellegrino's companies, Kanwyn Enterprises Inc. owned the land and buildings.
4  In June 2004, Mr. Kumar and his son began meeting with Mr. Pellegrino with a view to purchasing both companies, thereby acquiring the dealership, the land and the buildings. The negotiations continued into November, 2004.
5  Mr. Picco attended several of the meetings with the Kumars and Mr. Pellegrino as API's accountant. Mr. Picco is a chartered accountant. API engaged Mr. Picco to issue review engagement reports on API's financial statements for the years ended August 31, 2001 to 2004 (the "Reports"). Mr. Pellegrino told the Kumars that he was not good with numbers, and referred them to Mr. Picco for questions about API's finances.
6  The Kumars say that in the course of the negotiations, Mr. Picco made various statements about the value of the business, such as telling them that people would be lined up to buy the business and producing calculations of the value of the business. They say that on or about September 16, 2004 Mr. Picco told Mr. Kumar that the purchase deposit of <damage type = "other">$250,000</damage> would be adequately secured by a promissory note from API and Mr. Pellegrino.
7  The Kumars say that they received the 2002 and 2003 Reports on September 7, 2004. They say that Mr. Picco brought the Reports to a meeting, took them from his briefcase and handed them to Mr. Pellegrino, who passed them to the Kumars. Mr. Kumar says that he relied on the Reports and on Mr. Picco's assurance that a promissory note would be adequate security when he paid the deposit directly to API in two instalments on September 28 and October 4, 2004.
8  Mr. Picco denies producing the Reports in the manner that the Kumars describe. He says that he thought that the Kumars had the Reports much earlier. He denies making the statements that the Kumars attribute to him, and particularly the comment regarding the security of the promissory notes. He says that Mr. Kumar had his own accountants and a lawyer to provide him with advice and that the lawyer had prepared draft purchase agreements which contemplated the deposit to be held in trust by the plaintiff's lawyer. Mr. Picco says that although Mr. Pellegrino asked Mr. Kumar to pay the deposit directly to API, Mr. Picco was confident that Mr. Kumar's lawyer would advise against this course. Mr. Picco says that he was surprised when he learned that Mr. Kumar had paid the deposit directly to API. Mr. Picco acknowledges that the Kumars were referring to the Reports in their negotiations with Mr. Pellegrino.
9  On approximately November 2, 2004, Mr. Kumar received the 2004 Reports. Neither the previously received Reports for 2003 and 2003 nor the newly received Reports for 2004 showed a liability of <damage type = "other">$747,735.62</damage> for unpaid provincial sales tax. This liability was assessed by the provincial government on September 29, 2003. Mr. Kumar says that had he known of this large liability, he would not have paid the deposit.
10  API and Mr. Pellegrino became bankrupt in 2005.
II. ISSUES
11  The issues are:
Are the defendants liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation on the Reports and statements regarding the adequacy of the promissory notes?
If so, was the plaintiff contributorily negligent?
What are the plaintiff's damages?
I will deal with each of these issues in turn.
III. NEGLIGENT MISREPRESENTATION
12  The plaintiff pleads this action as negligent misrepresentation. At the outset, it is useful to note that negligent misrepresentation and negligent misstatement are in fact the same cause of action and the two terms are often used interchangeably. As explained by Linden J.A. in R. v. Premakumaran, 2006 F.C.A. 213 para. 18:
Since the now-famous decision in Hedley Byrne & Co. v. Heller & Partners Ltd., [1963] 2 All E.R. 575 (U.K. H.L.), courts have recognized that an action in tort may lie, in appropriate circumstances, for damage caused by negligent misstatement or negligent misrepresentations.
13  In Queen v. Cognos Inc.,  para. 34, the Court identified five elements of negligent misrepresentation that a plaintiff must establish:
there must be a duty of care based on a special relationship between the representor and the representee;
the representation must be untrue, inaccurate or misleading;
the representor must have acted negligently in making the representation;
the representee must have relied in a reasonable manner on the negligent misrepresentation; and
the reliance must be detrimental to the representee in the sense that damages resulted.
14  In Hercules Management Ltd. v. Ernst & Young,  para. 22, 24 and para. 36-37, the Court elaborated on the "special relationship" required to found a duty of care:
22 ... In the context of a negligent misrepresentation action, then, deciding whether or not a prima facie duty of care exists necessitates an investigation into whether the defendant-representor and the plaintiff-representee can be said to be in a relationship of proximity or neighbourhood.
24 ... To my mind, proximity can be seen to inhere between a defendant-representor and a plaintiff-representee when two criteria relating to reliance may be said to exist on the facts: (a) the defendant ought reasonably to foresee that the plaintiff will rely on his or her representation; and (b) reliance by the plaintiff would, in the particular circumstances of the case, be reasonable. To use the term employed by my colleague, Iacobucci J., in Cognos, supra, at p. 110, the plaintiff and the defendant can be said to be in a "special relationship" whenever these two factors inhere.
[Emphasis added]
15  After a comprehensive analysis at para. 36-37 of the application of the Anns/Kamloops test to the tort of negligent misrepresentation, the Court restated its conclusions at para. 41:
The foregoing analysis should render the following points clear. A prima facie duty of care will arise on the part of a defendant in a negligent misrepresentation action when it can be said (a) that the defendant ought reasonably to have foreseen that the plaintiff would rely on his representation and (b) that reliance by the plaintiff, in the circumstances, would be reasonable. Even though, in the context of auditors' liability cases, such a duty will often (even if not always) be found to exist, the problem of indeterminate liability will frequently result in the duty being negated by the kinds of policy considerations already discussed. Where, however, indeterminate liability can be shown not to be a concern on the facts of a particular case, a duty of care will be found to exist. [Emphasis added]
16  Thus, the first Cognos element of negligent misrepresentation, a duty of care owed by the representor to the representee, has been elaborated on in Hercules Management to include elements of foreseeability and reasonableness of reliance. Therefore, to succeed in this case, Mr. Kumar has to prove the following elements:
Mr. Picco owed Mr. Kumar a duty of care based on a special relationship between them, such that:
Mr. Picco ought to have foreseen that the Mr. Kumar would rely on his representations; and
such reliance by Mr. Kumar on Mr. Picco's representations would be reasonable in the circumstances of this case.
Mr. Picco's representations were untrue, inaccurate, or misleading.
Mr. Picco was negligent in making these representations.
Mr. Kumar's reliance on Mr. Picco's negligent misrepresentations was reasonable.
Mr. Kumar has suffered damages because of his reliance on Mr. Picco's negligent misrepresentations.
17  Mr. Kumar argues that Mr. Picco has made two negligent misrepresentations:
the Reports; and
oral statements regarding the sufficiency of promissory notes given by API and Mr. Pellegrino to secure the deposit paid Mr. Kumar to API.
18  Because the nature of these representations is fundamentally different, each one has to be independently analyzed against the elements of negligent misrepresentation set out above. For the sake of convenience, I will first deal with the second representation.
A. Statements Regarding Promissory Notes
19  The defence argues that the alleged misrepresentation that the <damage type = "other">$250,000</damage> deposit would be adequately secured by two promissory notes from API and Mr. Pellegrino was not made and, in the alternatives, that the plaintiff could not reasonably rely upon such a representation when he knew it was not correct. The plaintiff had his own legal advisor who recommended that the deposit be paid into trust, not advanced to the company directly.
20  I do not accept the plaintiff's evidence that Mr. Picco told the Kumars that the deposit would be adequately secured by promissory note from API and Mr. Pellegrino. There would be no reason for him to do so. He knew that Mr. Kumar had his own lawyer and accountant, and would expect Mr. Kumar to take their advice. I do not believe that the Kumar's were intending to deceive the court, rather, I believe that they are mistaken: these statements were likely made by Mr. Pellegrino. Mr. Picco was present at the time, and the Kumars have mistakenly attributed the statements to him. I accept Mr. Picco's evidence that he did not make these statements.
21  As I found that these representations were not made by Mr. Picco, I do not need to analyze this particular allegation any further.
B. The Reports
1. Duty of Care
22  Mr. Kumar argues that he had a special relationship with Mr. Picco so that Mr. Picco owed him a duty of care. Mr. Kumar says that the following factors are sufficient to establish the special relationship and the duty of care:
Mr. Picco was aware that Mr. Kumar had the financial statements and was relying on them;
Mr. Picco was directly involved in several discussions regarding the financial statements and the value of API;
Mr. Picco explicitly or implicitly approved of Mr. Kumar using the financial statements;
Mr. Picco provided the statements to Mr. Pellegrino, who then immediately handed them to the Kumars without protest from Mr. Picco;
Mr. Picco knew that the Kumars were told that Mr. Picco was a qualified chartered accountant;
Mr. Picco made no attempt to restrict the use which the Kumars were making of the financial statements;
Mr. Picco was directly involved in discussions and negotiations regarding the value of the business and indicated or implied that he had sufficient knowledge about the business to comment on it and knew the value of the business;
Mr. Picco made statements directly to Mr. Kumar regarding the adequacy of promissory notes as security for the deposit; and
Mr. Picco made statements regarding the value of the business to the Kumars to the effect that there was a "line-up of people" ready to buy the business.
23  The defendants do not emphasize the duty of care in their argument. They say that Mr. Picco did not anticipate that the Reports would be used by Mr. Kumar for the purpose of deciding whether to make a deposit directly to API. Rather, Mr. Picco anticipated that Reports would be used by Mr. Kumar's own accountants, Morrow & Company, as part of their "due diligence" with respect to the purchase of API.
24  I am satisfied that Mr. Picco owed the plaintiff a duty of care. There is no issue with foreseeability of reliance because Mr. Picco actually knew that Mr. Kumar was using the Reports in his deliberations about buying the business. Mr. Picco attended meetings where the parties used the Reports in their negotiations.
25  Such reliance is clearly reasonable in the circumstances as Mr. Picco did not attempt to limit Mr. Kumar's use of the Reports or suggest that they were to be used only by Morrow & Company, Mr. Kumar's accountants. While the Reports were not initially prepared to assist Mr. Kumar in his deliberations, Mr. Picco knew that they were being used for that purpose and did not demur. There is, in these circumstances, no concern of indeterminate liability.
2. Were the Reports Untrue, Inaccurate, or Misleading
26  Having found a duty of care owed by Mr. Picco to Mr. Kumar, I have to now determine whether the representations, the Reports, were "untrue, inaccurate, or misleading".
27  The defence argues that the plaintiff has failed to prove that the Reports were "untrue, inaccurate or misleading" because there is no evidence that the PST balance shown on the 2002/2003 balance sheets was materially in error.
28  The defence further argues that the plaintiff must prove, on a balance of probabilities that a further review would have disclosed an incorrect PST balance at the end of the year. The defence says that the plaintiff could easily have established the amount of PST which was unpaid each month from September 2001 to January 2003 and has failed to do so.
29  The plaintiff does not have to establish the amount of PST owed to prove that the Reports were untrue, inaccurate or misleading. In the Reports, Mr. Picco provided an unqualified opinion on API's financial statements:
My review was made in accordance with generally accepted standards for review engagements and accordingly consisted primarily of enquiry, analytical procedures and discussion related to information supplied to me by the company.
...
Based on my review, nothing has come to my attention that causes me to believe that these financial statements are not, in all material respects, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
30  It is this assurance that Mr. Kumar relied on, which was at least inaccurate and misleading (as discussed below).
3. Were the Representations Negligently Made
31  To determine whether Mr. Picco was negligent in making these representations, I must determine if the Reports were prepared in accordance with the appropriate standard of care.
32  With respect to the standard of care, the plaintiff argues that the applicable professional standards are set out in the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' Handbook (the "CICA Handbook"). The CICA Handbook requires an accountant, on a review engagement, to "perform a review, with a limited objective of assessing whether the information being reported on is plausible in the circumstances within the framework of appropriate criteria". The plaintiff says that Mr. Picco failed to determine whether the PST account reported by the API's management was "plausible".
33  The defence says that a professional is not held to a standard of perfection, but that he or she owes a duty of care to exercise the skill, care and diligence which may reasonably be expected of a professional of ordinary competence, measured by the professional standard of the time.
34  The defence says that Mr. Picco was retained to provide review engagement reports, not audit reports; meaning that the scope of the review is less and the level of assurance is lower than on an audit. A review engagement provides a negative assurance that nothing has come to the accountant's attention which causes him or her to believe that the financial statements are not in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). A review engagement assesses whether the information being reported is plausible.
35  The plaintiff relies on the report of Brian Gardiner, CA, CFE. Mr. Gardiner is of the opinion that Mr. Picco did not meet the standard of care for a chartered accountant in the preparation of the Reports for 2001-2004. Mr. Gardiner relies on the standards applicable to review engagements in the CICA Handbook:
8100.15 Review standards
...
The public accountant should perform a review with the limited objective of assessing whether the information being reported on is plausible in the circumstances within the framework of appropriate criteria. Such a review should consist of:
enquiry, analytical procedures and discussion; and
public accountant's knowledge of the business carried on by the enterprise and the results of the enquiry, and analytical procedures and discussion cause him or her to doubt the plausibility of such information.
...
8100.17 Knowledge of the Entity's Business
To judge whether the information being reported on is plausible in the circumstances, the public accountant must be in a position to assess whether the information obtained during the course of the engagement is plausible. This requires sufficient [less than]knowledge[greater than] of the enterprise and the business in which it is involved to make intelligent enquiries and a reasonable assessment of responses and other information obtained.
8100.19 Review Procedures
A review consists primarily of:
making enquiries concerning financial, operating, contractual and other information, and considering responses that, in addition to oral responses, may take the form of listings, schedules or other documents;
applying analytical procedures such as comparing the current and prior period information and considering the reasonableness of financial and other inter-relationships. Analytical procedures performed during a review engagement would normally be less extensive than analytical procedures performed during an audit.
Having discussions with appropriate officials of the enterprise concerning information received and the information being reported on.
8100.20 When the public accountant doubts the plausibility of the information being reported on, sufficient additional or more extensive procedures would be carries out to resolve such doubt or confirm that a reservation is required.
36  Mr. Gardiner refers as well to the CICA review engagement checklist which asks "[h]ave sales, withholdings, GST and other taxes been considered?" In the checklist for each year's file Mr. Picco has answered 'Y' to this question, indicating that these items have been considered. Mr. Picco's files also contain copies of API's monthly self-assessment remittance forms for PST for 2002 and 2003; copies of the general ledger printout for account 2200, the PST payable account, for fiscal year ending August 31, 2002; and documents 1894 and 1895 where Mr. Picco recast fiscal activity recorded within general ledger account 2200. Mr. Gardiner concludes that Mr. Picco did not test the reasonableness of the PST account; he simply checked the last month's self-assessment against the accounts payable in the ledger. Mr. Gardiner opines that a simple reasonableness assessment of multiplying monthly sales by 7% PST (<damage type = "other">$700,000</damage> monthly sales x 7% PST= <damage type = "other">$49,000</damage>) would have demonstrated that API's monthly self-assessments of <damage type = "other">$3,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$6,000</damage> for PST were suspect, and this would have required further inquiry.
37  Mr. Gardiner further says that in 2002 Mr. Picco requested a printout of the detail for the general ledger account 2200 because he felt that the PST payable of <damage type = "other">$24,626.71</damage> was large. Mr. Gardiner notes that this PST liability would account for annual new car sales of <damage type = "other">$700,000</damage>, which the company was reporting on a monthly basis. Mr. Gardiner concludes that Mr. Picco's failure to consider that the sales figures reported by API did not accord with API's self-assessed PST liability and remittance was well below the standard expected of a chartered accountant.
38  The defence relies on the opinion of Catherine Greyell, CA. Ms. Greyell, too, refers to the CICA Handbook, including the following provisions:
8100.05 ... In this section, the word "plausible "is used in the sense of appearing to be worthy of belief based on the information obtained by the public accountant in connection with the review.
...
8299.02 The public accountant's enquiry, analytical procedures and discussion ... would normally include:
...
performing analytical procedures, which could include:
comparing the financial statements with those of the immediately preceding period and with any budgets for the current year; and
considering interrelationships of key elements of financial statements that would be expected tot conform to a predictable pattern based on the experience of the enterprise;
and obtaining explanations for the relationships and individual items that appear to be unusual.
39  Ms. Greyell opines:
In assessing the PST work completed by Mr. Picco, I draw my opinions not only from my past experience, but also from the standards established by my office ... no specific checklist or questions exist in our review of balances owed by a company with respect to PST. The PST payable balance is evaluated in a manner consistent with other accounts payable balances ... our work would typically include ... an explanation for the variance between the current period end balance and the prior period end balance and possibly (depending on the amount of the payable and/or the explanation for change in balance) a reconciliation to the company's remittance advice.
Ms. Greyell explained that this means checking the current year against the preceding year, and accepting the balance as plausible if there is no significant difference.
40  She continues:
Unless a professional accountant has specific concerns with respect to PST and the plausibility of information provided by management, he/she would not be expected to perform a reconciliation to sales on the PST remitted to the Ministry of Finance in a given year. In my opinion, given that the working paper files appear to suggest that nothing caused Mr. Picco to question the plausibility of the PST balance, I would not have expected Mr. Picco to perform a reconciliation of PST to sales in any of the years 2001 to 2004 inclusive.
41  I am satisfied that Mr. Picco's conduct fell below the standard of care required of a public accountant on a review engagement.
42  I adopt the reasoning of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Bloor Italian Gifts Limited v. Dixon  para. 27-31 (C.A.), a case very similar to this:
[27] To establish whether Dixon's conduct fell below the standard of care required of a public accountant on a review engagement, it is necessary to assess whether the applicable standard of care would have resulted in the discovery of the retail sales tax problem at issue. In determining the standard of care required of Dixon in these circumstances, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook ("CICA Handbook") is of great assistance. The CICA Handbook sets out the professional standards that apply to accountants in conducting a review engagement. The CICA Handbook explains that a review engagement consists "primarily of enquiry, analytical procedures and discussion related to information supplied to the public accountant by the enterprise with the limited objective of assessing whether the information being reported on is plausible within the framework of appropriate criteria". 'Plausible' is defined as "appearing to be worthy of belief based on the information obtained by the public accountant in connection with the review". The CICA Handbook also stipulates that an accountant must apply "analytical procedures such as comparing the current and prior period information and considering the reasonableness of financial and other inter-relationships ... Explanations for relationships and individual items that appear to be unusual would be obtained by directing inquiries to appropriate personnel of the enterprise, the responses to which the public accountant is entitled to accept without examination of supporting evidence as long as such responses appear plausible."
[29] In addition, the CICA Handbook requires that the accountant has sufficient knowledge of the business to make intelligent inquiries and further that the accountant possess an appreciation of matters that could have a significant effect on the information being reported on. The accountant must also ensure proper supervision over any assistants he employs.
[30] A checklist prepared by the CICA includes the possible existence of any sales tax liability, assessed or not, as an item into which the accountant ought to inquire. Another checklist item requires the accountant and his staff to inquire about how sales tax and other taxes are determined and recorded.
[31] Professional standards of conduct such as those prescribed in the CICA Handbook provide a persuasive guide as to what constitutes the standard of reasonable care for a professional: See ter Neuzen v. Korn,  at 696-698.
43  The CICA Handbook establishes the standards of Mr. Picco's profession. It requires him to attain sufficient knowledge of the business in issue to be able to "make intelligent enquiries and a reasonable assessment of responses and other information obtained". In this case, that would involve knowledge of the volume of sales by API, and of the application of provincial sales tax to those sales. Within this framework, Mr. Picco is required to determine whether the information being reported on is plausible, i.e., appears to be worthy of belief. I accept the opinion of Mr. Gardiner that to assess the plausibility of the PST payable, Mr. Picco should have undertaken some rough calculation of its reasonableness. In the words of the trial judge in Bloor at para. 32:
... it would not have required much effort on the part of the accountant at year-end to multiply the sales shown on the financial statement by seven or eight percent, depending upon the year, and compare it with the sum of the twelve RST payments made during the year and thereby test the 'plausibility' or 'reasonableness' of the amount of taxes actually paid.
44  It would be difficult to determine that a number reported by the company is plausible without some assessment. Here, I accept Mr. Gardiner's opinion that Mr. Picco should have done a rough calculation by, at a minimum, multiplying sales by 7% to assess that plausibility of the reported PST payable. While this would likely be an overestimate, as there would be some sales where PST is not payable at all and other sales where tax is not payable on the full purchase price, it would be a rough calculation against which to measure the reported number.
45  Ms. Greyell's description of the practice of comparing one year end number against the preceding year end number is a short form for assessing plausibility: it assumes that if the last year end number is plausible, and this year end number is not significantly different, then it, too, is plausible. As a side note, I question whether this abbreviated route is really sufficient to meet the CICA Handbook requirement of assessing plausibility, as the accountant in this example takes no step to determine the plausibility of the number itself, he or she simply compares it to the preceding year. However, for the reasons that follow, I do not need to determine this point in this case.
46  In any event, the abbreviated form may not be appropriate in all circumstances, as Ms. Greyell acknowledged in cross-examination. Preparing the Report on the 2002 financial statement, Mr. Picco had specifically requested a printout of the PST payable account for that year. He reviewed it in detail, identifying remittances made each month from September 2001 to August 31, 2002 to address his concern that the PST payable reported by API had grown from <damage type = "other">$598</damage> on April 15, 2002 to <damage type = "other">$24,626.71</damage> on August 31, 2002. Mr. Picco noted on his working paper that "client did not make sufficient PST payments during the last 1/2 of the year and balance has grown steadily. ..." Ms. Greyell was questioned about Mr. Picco's review of this document. She acknowledged that Mr. Picco would know that API had gross monthly new vehicle sales of approximately <damage type = "other">$600,000</damage> per month and against those sales, the monthly PST payable/remittance reported by API would not be plausible and should have raised a doubt about its plausibility, which would in turn have required Mr. Picco to obtain an explanation from API. Ms. Greyell conceded that Mr. Picco, by failing to seek an explanation, failed to meet the standard for a reasonable public accountant. This concession also informs the 2003 review engagement. Taking Ms. Greyell's approach to plausibility, the failure to inquire in 2002 affects the 2003 Report as well: if the 2002 number cannot be said to be plausible, then it cannot be used as a benchmark for plausibility for 2003.
47  The PST payable set out in the 2002 (and 2003, as derived from 2002) financial statement was implausible. Mr. Picco should have inquired further and did not. The Social Service Tax Return Worksheet completed by API showed sales of <damage type = "other">$517,135.17</damage> in August 2003. If all were taxable, the PST to be remitted for that month would be <damage type = "other">$36,199.45</damage>. If half of those sales were taxable, <damage type = "other">$18,000</damage> should have been remitted. However, API reported tax collectable of <damage type = "other">$5,523.23</damage>. Thus, the magnitude of the inaccuracy of the PST payable may well have been in the order of <damage type = "other">$180,000</damage> to <damage type = "other">$360,000</damage> per year for 2002 and 2003, using the August 2003 worksheet as a guide.
48  However, that is not really the issue. Mr. Kumar was not looking to Mr. Picco to tell him what the PST payable was, but to tell him that, after performing a review to appropriate standards, nothing had come to his attention that caused him to believe that the financial information being reported on was not in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. It was the assurance that the Reports were "made in accordance with generally accepted standards for review engagements" and that "nothing has come to my attention that causes me to believe that these financial statements are not, in all material respects, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles", that was inaccurate and misleading and, I conclude, was negligently made.
49  Mr. Picco's review was not made in accordance with the generally accepted standards for review engagements. Generally accepted standards would have required him to investigate further, as Ms. Greyell properly conceded. Mr. Picco could not provide the unqualified opinion as he did: it was a negligent misrepresentation.
4. Reasonable Reliance
50  Having concluded that the Reports were negligent misrepresentations, I have to determine whether Mr. Kumar's reliance on the Reports in his decision to pay the deposit to API was reasonable.
51  Mr. Kumar says that he reasonably relied on the financial statements:
He had no reason to believe or suspect that the financial statements were inaccurate or improperly or negligently prepared.
He knew that Mr. Picco was a qualified chartered accountant and had been doing work for API for several years. It was reasonable for him to believe that Mr. Picco had detailed knowledge regarding API's financial circumstances.
The 2002/2003 financial statements indicated that API was making a modest profit, paying its liabilities in a timely way and was solvent.
Mr. Kumar was not relying on the financial statements for the purpose of determining a purchase price. Rather, he was relying on the statements to the extent of determining that the company had value for the purpose of making an advance payment of <damage type = "other">$250,000</damage>.
Mr. Picco had also made statements and provided a document which indicated that API had a value in excess of <damage type = "other">$2.8 million</damage>.
The Kumar's understood that Mr. Pellegrino was also the owner of Kanwyn, which owned the land and buildings, which had significant value. They had no information that Mr. Pellegrino was in personal financial difficulties.
The reasons offered by Picco and Pellegrino for a direct deposit to API were apparently legitimate: the payment would assist the company through a short-term cash flow problem and result in a more valuable asset on purchase.
52  The defence argues that Mr. Picco could not have reasonably foreseen that the plaintiff would rely on the Reports when deciding whether to pay the deposit directly to API and could not contemplate that the plaintiff would use the Reports for precisely this purpose.
53  The defence says that while Mr. Pellegrino asked the plaintiff to make the deposit directly to API, Mr. Picco believed that the plaintiff would not do so because he had independent legal advice. He did not anticipate that the Reports would be used as a basis for making a direct deposit to the vendor.
54  In my view, Mr. Kumar reasonably relied on the reports. Mr. Picco, an independent accountant, provided an opinion or comment on API's financial statements, and it is this opinion or comment that Mr. Kumar relied on. He was looking to Mr. Picco to assure him that the financial statements were in accordance with the GAAP. As the CICA Handbook notes in section 8100.06:
The negative assurance form of reporting used for review engagements ... informs the reader that, although sufficient evidence has not been obtained to enable the public accountant to express an audit opinion, a review has been completed in accordance with the standards of this Section and nothing has come to the attention of the public accountant that causes him or her to believe that the information being reported on is not, in all material respects, in accordance with appropriate criteria.
55  Such an assurance can only be given when the standards have been met (s. 8100.15). If the accountant is not able to give the assurance, he or she may issue the report with a reservation (s. 8100.32). No reservation was issued in this case and thus Mr. Kumar, as the reader of the Reports, could reasonably assume that API's financial statements were in fact reviewed in accordance with the generally accepted standards and that there was nothing amiss.
56  Mr. Picco's evidence may be summarized as "I never thought that you would give the deposit directly to the company, regardless of its financial condition; I thought that your lawyer would tell you not to do that." That issue is properly one of contributory negligence, not reasonable reliance.
57  On the facts before me, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for Mr. Kumar to rely on the Reports and the assurance they provided when advancing the deposit. He had no reason to believe that the Reports were not properly prepared. Mr. Picco had been the company's accountant for several years and attended the meetings between the Kumars and Mr. Pellegrino, provided information and answered questions about the finances of the business. Mr. Picco knew that Mr. Kumar was relying on the Reports in his deliberations regarding purchase of the business and should have anticipated that Mr. Kumar would look at the Reports as one of the factors in deciding whether to advance the deposit.
5. Were Damages Suffered Because of Reliance
58  Finally, it must be determined whether Mr. Kumar has actually suffered damages because of his reasonable reliance on Mr. Picco's negligent misrepresentations.
59  On the facts before me, I conclude that he did. Unless Mr. Kumar was satisfied as to the financial condition of the company (and the Reports would be at least one factor in this decision), it is unlikely that a deposit would be paid, whether in trust or otherwise.
IV. CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE
60  The defence argues that if Mr. Picco is liable for negligent misrepresentation, then the court must apportion a significant amount of contributory fault to the plaintiff. The defence further argues that Mr. Pellegrino and API committed a fraud on both Mr. Picco and the plaintiff and a significant portion of fault must be borne by them.
61  The defence argues that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent in that he failed to follow his own solicitor's advice with respect to payment of the deposit by providing the money directly to Mr. Pellegrino. In this respect, Mr. Kumar has acknowledged that his actions were "foolish".
62  The defence relies on Leischner v. West Kootenay  (C.A.). The defence argues that pursuant to s. 2(c) of the Negligence Act, a plaintiff who contributed to his own loss can only obtain several judgments against the defendants liable for his loss, in proportion to that for which the defendant was at fault. The defence suggests that 90% of the fault should be attributed to Mr. Pellegrino and the balance of 10% divided by the plaintiff and the defendants.
63  The plaintiff argues that making a simple error in judgment is not the same as contributory negligence, relying on Hongkong Bank of Can. v. Touche Ross & Co.  para. 18-19 and para. 50 (C.A.):
18 ... But, though the trial judge did not deal in specific terms with the question of whether the bank was careless in failing to call for an audited statement as of 30th June 1982 before authorizing the loan, he did deal with that question in general terms as part of an overall consideration of the bank's conduct in making the loan, in these words [p. 6]:
There is certainly some validity in the criticisms levelled against the plaintiff in making the loan. In my view, even without hindsight, there was an error in judgment in extending the line of credit. However, I find insufficient lack of care and prudence on the part of the bank to justify a finding of negligence in making this loan.
19 On the questions of fact arising from the evidence there is, in my opinion, no mistake in the conception of the evidence by the trial judge such that this court would be justified in reconsidering the evidence and concluding that the authorization of the loan by the bank on the basis of the material before it was a failure to take reasonable care for its own safety. That being so, the trial judge's conclusion that the bank was not contributorily negligent in relation to the authorization of the loan must stand.
...
50 But when the victim has no reason to know or foresee that he is or may be in danger from the negligent act of another, the perpetrator of the negligent act cannot complain that the victim did not take reasonable care. The respondent had no reason before April 1983 to doubt the accuracy of the audit. Once the respondent knew of the undisclosed liability, it did have a duty to take reasonable care in handling the loan but no argument was made to us that the respondent's conduct after it learned of the negligence of the appellant was imprudent.
[Emphasis added]
64  The plaintiff says that there may be contributory negligence where the plaintiff has suffered loss as a result of a misrepresentation, but that would be an unusual case. I cannot say whether this case is an unusual one or not, as I conclude that Mr. Kumar was clearly contributorily negligent.
65  However, I am not able to accede to the defence's argument regarding attribution of fault to Mr. Pellegrino. It may well be that Mr. Pellegrino was fraudulent, as the defence argues, and intentionally hid the PST assessment and liability from Mr. Picco. However, I have no evidence on this issue, beyond the PST assessment document and the bankruptcy of API. Any conclusion that I would reach would be speculative. Mr. Pellegrino and API are not parties to this action. I have no idea what they may have to say on the issue. It may be that API never received the assessment, or that the assessment was disputed, or that Mr. Pellegrino himself had no knowledge of the matter. In the absence of evidence, I cannot make findings on this issue.
66  Secondly, Mr. Kumar was not relying on Mr. Pellegrino to advise him of the company's finances, he was relying on Mr. Picco's Reports. While Mr. Picco may have a claim against Mr. Pellegrino/API for failing to advise him of the PST assessment, as the retainer agreement required Mr. Pellegrino/API to do, that failure did not cause Mr. Kumar's loss. Had Mr. Picco performed the review engagement to the appropriate standards of care, it is reasonable to conclude that the Reports would not have been issued without reservation, as they were.
67  I accept the defendant's argument that Mr. Kumar was contributorily negligent. Mr. Kumar had been involved in several other business transactions in Canada. Mr. Robinson was his solicitor and had acted for him on these other matters. As Mr. Kumar knew, in each of those transactions the deposit was held in trust until the transaction completed. Mr. Robinson was also acting for Mr. Kumar on this transaction. Mr. Robinson prepared draft agreements for this transaction which contemplated that the deposit would be held in his trust account until completion. Mr. Kumar knew that the deposit would be protected if it was held by Mr. Robinson. Mr. Kumar and his son discussed the matter and Mr. Kumar decided to pay the deposit directly to API. On his instruction, Kuran Kumar revised the draft agreement, changing the deposit payment from a deposit to Mr. Robinson's trust account to direct payment to API. Mr. Kumar and Mr. Pellegrino signed the revised agreement. Mr. Kumar did not seek advice from Mr. Robinson or from his accountants regarding this change.
68  In my view, the majority of the fault for Mr. Kumar's loss lies with him. He did not act appropriately to protect his own interests. I assess 75% of the fault to Mr. Kumar and 25% to Mr. Picco.
V. DAMAGES
69  The damages in this case are quite straight forward. Mr. Kumar advanced a deposit of <damage type = "other">$250,000</damage>. He demanded return of the money in December, 2004. The money was not returned. Mr. Pellegrino and API both became bankrupt. There is no real prospect of recovery of the deposit in the bankruptcy. Therefore, Mr. Kumar's loss is <damage type = "total">$250,000</damage> and Mr. Picco is liable for 25% of this loss.
VI. CONCLUSION
70  In conclusion, Mr. Kumar will have judgment against the defendants for <damage type = "total after">$62,500</damage>, interest, and costs at scale B, unless there are matters of which I am not aware.

Action by Gillespie seeking damages for personal injuries sustained in two motor vehicle accidents. Liability for both accidents was admitted by the defendants. The first accident took place in December 2009. Gillespie was proceeding through an intersection when his vehicle was struck by a taxi that failed to stop for a stop sign, propelling Gillespie's vehicle into the path of an oncoming cube truck. Gillespie struck his head against his vehicle's windshield, cracking the glass and causing lacerations to his head. In January 2010, Gillespie was rear-ended while stopped at a red light. The impact was minor, but Gillespie claimed it aggravated his neck and back for the next seven to 10 days. Following the accidents, Gillespie was left with soft tissue injuries, an inner ear injury, and compromised brain functioning. He claimed he had memory problems that resulted in his work activities. He claimed he had headaches constantly for six months and that he continued to use pain medication for back pain and headaches. He denied experiencing anxiety prior to the accidents, despite a record of one doctor's visit for anxiety issues. He claimed he experienced anxiety after the accidents. His wife confirmed Gillespie's personality changed for the worse after the accidents. His family doctor relied on a neurologist's report in diagnosing a mild brain injury. The neurologist was not called to provide evidence. The family doctor opined that Gillespie would continue to suffer from the effects of the first accident indefinitely. A defence expert opined that Gillespie's cognitive impairment was attributable to metabolic syndrome rather than a brain injury. 

HELD: Action allowed.
 Gillespie was awarded <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$85,000</damage> in non-pecuniary damages, <damage type = "past wage loss">$160,000</damage> for past income loss, <damage type = "future wage loss">$140,000</damage> for lost earning capacity, <damage type = "future care">$2,500</damage> for future care costs and <damage type = "special">$918</damage> in special damages. Despite its shortcomings, the evidence of the family doctor was accepted as the best indicator of Gillespie's actual condition and its cause. The defence expert's opinion was given little weight because he did not understand the severity of the first accident. Inconsistencies in Gillespie's evidence were attributed to his injuries, not an attempt to misrepresent them. The court accepted he sustained a mild traumatic brain injury, inner ear dysfunction, headaches, and neck and back pain. He developed anxiety and his mood changed, impacting his daily life and work. His evidence about being limited in the work he could perform was not specific enough to convince the court of the figures he suggested for past and future income loss, so the court estimated those figures. His future care costs and special damages were limited to headache pain medication.

Reasons for Judgment
T.C. ARMSTRONG J.
Introduction
1  This action concerns Mr. Gillespie's claim for damages for injuries he alleges were caused by motor vehicle accidents in December 2009 (the first accident) and January 2010 (the second accident).
2  On December 1, 2009, the plaintiff was driving a 2002 Honda Civic through an intersection in Vancouver when a taxi failed to stop at a stop sign and struck his vehicle. The plaintiff's car then collided with a cube van coming from the opposite direction, and he hit his head against his car's windshield. The impact cracked the glass, and the glass lacerated his head.
3  On January 22, 2010, the plaintiff was involved in a minor rear-end collision when he was stopped at a red light. He claims this incident aggravated his neck and back "a bit", and the symptoms lasted seven to 10 days.
4  The controversy in this case turns largely on the nature and extent of the injury to Mr. Gillespie's head from the first accident.
5  The defendants admit liability for both accidents and this trial concerned the extent of Mr. Gillespie's injuries and an assessment of damages that may have been caused by each accident.
6  The plaintiff seeks the following damages for injuries in both accidents:
non-pecuniary: $85,000 - $110,000 ($1,000 to $3,000 of that claim is for the second collision);
past income loss: $241,452;
future loss of earning capacity: $285,997;
special damages: $600 - $800; and
future care costs: $1,642 - $3,285.
The Issues
7  After the accidents the plaintiff presented with various minor soft tissue injuries, an injury to his inner ear, and symptoms indicating his brain function was compromised. There are two principal issues and two preliminary issues to be addressed in this trial. The findings on the secondary issues will impact the findings on the principal issues so I will discuss them first:
Principal issues:
After the accidents, did the plaintiff suffer symptoms from metabolic syndrome unrelated to the accidents or did he suffer a mild traumatic brain injury caused by the first accident?
What is the proper measure of the plaintiff's damages if:
the plaintiff suffered a mild traumatic brain injury, an inner ear injury and soft tissue injuries to his neck and back in the first accident and exacerbated by the second accident? or
the plaintiff did not suffer a brain injury in the first accident but suffered neck and back injuries resulting from both accidents?
Secondary issues:
Should I draw an adverse inference against the plaintiff for failing to call Dr. Foti?
How much weight should I give the expert medical opinion?
The Facts
Before the Accident
8  Mr. Gillespie is a 65-year-old married father of two adult children.
9  He lives with his wife in Burnaby, BC.
10  After graduating from high school, he attended Vancouver City College.
11  Sometime after finishing at City College, he entered the flooring business, and in 1984, opened his own business specializing in niche flooring products. He spent most of the next 16 years operating that business, but in approximately 2000, Mr. Gillespie and his wife were forced into bankruptcy because that business failed.
12  He then obtained employment selling "sun rooms" in BC and Alberta; he worked in that role until 2004.
13  In 2004, the plaintiff and his wife moved to Burnaby to facilitate her education at BCIT. She pursued a course in human relations and eventually obtained employment with the Genome Sciences Centre.
14  Between September 2004 and January 2005, the plaintiff was unemployed. In 2005 he took a position with AAA Flooring (AAA), a local flooring company. His role was to prepare quotes for prospective flooring customers, order materials and oversee installation work. After one and a half years, he became dissatisfied with his employer's work practices which he believed were adversely affecting his health.
15  He then began his own flooring proprietorship, and in January 2008, he incorporated a company to carry on the business. His plan was to accumulate sufficient funds in the company's retained earnings so he and his wife could retire to the Okanagan in approximately three years.
16  He testified that before the first accident he did not have any health problems and was not seeing a physician for specific concerns. He did have high cholesterol, but he had no history of concussion, hypertension, dizziness, concentration problems, and/or memory problems.
17  When working for his previous employer AAA, he experienced some difficulties with the sleep difficulties and saw a physician for advice in 2006; he related these physical problems with stress at his work with AAA. He did not receive any prescription medication to deal with sleep and these problems resolved after he left his employment.
18  He testified that he was not aware of having anxiety before the first accident, and he consulted his doctor only about sleep problems. He did not remember a meeting with his doctor in 2006 when his anxiety was discussed; there is a record of such a discussion but the author of the notes did not testify. Nevertheless, between 2006 and December 2009, he did not have any anxiety or sleep issues.
19  His current business is restricted to commercial and institutional flooring supply work. When he began this business, Mr. Gillespie was responsible for all aspects of the work, including bookkeeping, record-keeping, reviewing proposals, measuring, and preparing quotations. When his bids were successful, he ordered product from suppliers, rented trucks to transport material to job sites, attended to the unloading of materials, engaged sub-contract installers and reviewed the work after completion. He also attended work sites to correct deficiencies. He does not do the physical work himself; he engages subcontractors to do all flooring installations.
20  He performs his record keeping and book work manually. He prepares quotes and invoices for the business, and he uses a bookkeeper and a chartered accountant to complete his financial statements and reporting to Canada Revenue.
21  His typical work day starts at 5:30 am and concludes around 4:30 pm.
22  Mrs. Gillespie confirmed that prior to the accident the plaintiff was rarely sick and had no specific health concerns.
23  Regarding physical activities before the accident, the plaintiff and his wife regularly walked together. He used an elliptical trainer and treadmill and occasionally played golf.
The Accident
24  When the first collision happened, Mr. Gillespie was travelling in his 2002 Honda Civic with one of his flooring installers, Will Pingot. They were traveling westbound on 33rd Avenue when the defendant's taxi emerged from Culloden Avenue and struck the side of his vehicle, causing it to collide with a cube van.
25  The airbags deployed, and airbag powder filled the vehicle. The plaintiff's head struck and shattered the upper left side of the front windshield.
26  After the collision, Mr. Pingot asked the plaintiff what had happened; he replied that the airbag was going off. Once they were outside of the vehicle, Mr. Pingot then observed the plaintiff talking to someone on the telephone. He told the plaintiff to call 911 and Mr. Gillespie placed that call. Mr. Gillespie was walking around and sitting along the road. Mr. Gillespie requested Mr. Pingot to drive him to the Burnaby General Hospital. He left the plaintiff at the hospital.
Immediately after the Accident
27  Mr. Gillespie testified in chief that after the accident:
he felt woozy but did not have pain;
his head was bleeding;
his lip was cut;
he got out of the vehicle and walked around;
the damage to his vehicle and the taxi was considerable, and his vehicle was unrepairable;
a neighbor provided a towel for his head;
the fire department and an ambulance arrived;
the ambulance staff asked if he had lost consciousness;
he declined the ambulance staff's invitation to be taken to Vancouver General Hospital;
his passenger Mr. Pingot, drove him to Burnaby General Hospital;
he waited at Burnaby General Hospital, and they tested his blood pressure and his eyes and asked him about dizziness;
he did not remember any unconsciousness;
hospital staff repaired the hanging skin cut to his forehead;
he was dizzy and nauseous;
he had back, knee and ankle pain;
he had a headache on the left side;
he does not recall how long he remained at Burnaby General Hospital or when he left the hospital, but he recalls being advised not to go to sleep;
his wife and daughter arrived at Burnaby General Hospital and took him home;
he eventually went to sleep; and
his general and low back pain worsened.
28  When the plaintiff was cross-examined, he said he could recall very little of what transpired at the Burnaby General Hospital; he could not recall being dizzy, nauseous or experiencing headaches. When presented with his discovery evidence he acknowledged there were differences between his testimony at trial and his responses at the discovery. I will address that point below.
29  He could not remember how long he was at the accident scene or whether he had pain in his head. However, he specifically recalled that during the night, his dizziness, low back and neck pain worsened, although he did not recall having nausea. He denied the suggestion that his headaches and dizziness occurred only in the morning.
30  The plaintiff was not certain, but he believed that the next day (the visit was actually two days later on December 3) he saw his family doctor, Dr. Levis, who advised him to "take it easy". He testified that he told his doctor that his headaches were sharper over the eye area, that he had neck pain at the base of his skull, and that he had low back, leg, and ankle pain.
31  He was asked about his failure to mention his headaches to Dr. Levis on December 2 or 3, and he denied the suggestion that his headaches did not begin until the morning of December 3. And he framed his answers about dizziness as "to the best of my recollection I had dizziness." When Mr. Gillespie resorted to the phrase "to the best of my recollection" I inferred that he does not have a clear memory of such events and was doing his best to reconstruct what he thinks occurred.
32  He said he followed his doctor's advice, but during the following week his headaches worsened, and he became concerned about the prospects of a head injury.
33  After approximately one week, he obtained a CT scan at Royal Columbian Hospital; he was told that nothing was seriously wrong with his head.
34  His headaches were unrelenting for the first six months after the first accident.
35  He said there was a little bit of dizziness for one week after the first accident. He had low back pain for about one month, and the pain in his neck and right leg also improved within a month.
36  In the days after the accident, he was feeling some pressure to return to work, but he was finding it hard to concentrate and believed he was making mistakes. He would add numbers incorrectly and would reverse numbers even when using a calculator.
37  He does not recall telling his wife about these problems at the time, but he does recall Dr. Levis advising him to go to physiotherapy. He attended physiotherapy as prescribed.
38  The gash on his forehead healed within four to five months although a scar remains on his forehead.
39  Other than physiotherapy the only treatment he received was medication for his headaches and sleep issues.
40  Mr. Gillespie did not tell Dr. Levis that he had experienced anxiety before the accident and she did not review his medical records from before the accident, until well after writing her report. He was confronted with his family doctor's 2006 notes which reflected a comment that for two years he had been waking in the middle of the night feeling anxious. He testified that he had not had any pre-accident anxiety issues. He said he had been able to begin his new business in 2006 and had made a success of the business without problems relating to anxiety.
The Second Accident
41  On January 22, 2010, Mr. Gillespie was involved in the second accident. This rear-end collision caused a jolt that aggravated his neck and back pain. The changes to those symptoms lasted seven to 10 days. From then on, his neck problems came and went, but long drives aggravated this condition. If he turned his head sharply, he also experienced pain.
Life after the Accidents
42  Although Mr. Gillespie's low back discomfort improved, if he sits for prolonged periods, his back will ache.
43  His neck and right leg were not painful after the first one month.
44  He had some dizziness for approximately one week after the first accident, but that symptom has resolved.
45  In the first month after the first accident, his headaches worsened; they were constant and fluctuated from being bearable to unbelievably sharp pains during the first six months post-accident. His eyes became strained if he read too much.
46  During the first month after the first accident Mr. Gillespie did not stop working at any time. He does not remember ever refraining from driving and could not be sure if he reduced his number of hours worked. He said it was hard to concentrate and he was making mistakes in calculations.
47  He was having memory difficulties.
48  He was prescribed Tylenol 3's, but he found they made him dozy. He started taking over-the-counter medications and has used six to eight Tylenol pills per day ever since. He currently takes two in the morning, two during the day, and two at night. The Tylenol costs approximately $180 per year.
49  His wife's medical plan covered the prescription medication, and he paid for the over-the-counter drugs (Tylenol) personally.
50  He was referred to the Fraser Health Concussion Clinic on April 14, 2010 where he was advised:
to reduce the number of tasks he focused on at any one time;
to stop work if he became confused;
to avoid television, radio and noisy places;
to use sticky notes for reminders; and
to focus on smaller jobs rather than larger jobs that may involve multiple trades in confined areas (this strategy has resulted in him not doing large jobs).
51  In cross-examination, Mr. Gillespie said he had no memory of the visit to the concussion clinic. He said he went to the clinic because of problems with work, anxiety and memory, but he then said he could not remember which problems actually led to his attendance at the clinic. He did not remember the interview at the clinic or that he told them he was functioning at 90% of his physical, emotional, and cognitive capacity at the time. He also could not remember the questionnaire given to him at the clinic nor his responses. The concussion clinic recommended that he return for a second session; he declined.
52  He tried to maintain his routine but felt he was becoming confused; this confusion prompted him to stop work. When he worked on more than one project at a time, he felt his anxiety build up. He avoids using television and radios when he is working.
53  BC Housing was one of his clients, and he typically enjoyed a good working relationship with that institution. They often did work in single room occupancy buildings. However following the accidents, Mr. Gillespie claimed he had to stop taking on that type of work because the job sites were too confusing for him.
54  Mr. Gillespie claims that his memory has deteriorated since the accident. He said he forgets fax numbers, phone numbers, conversations and other details. He has word finding difficulties and transposes numbers when doing work related calculations. He sometimes forgets street names and numbers.
55  He makes sticky notes to remind himself of tasks that need to be done. He has a book where he lists the things he needs for specific jobs, and he has increased the amount of detail he keeps in his workbooks.
56  In May 2011, his family doctor referred him to a neurologist, Dr. Foti. The doctor did some concussion testing, and Mr. Gillespie said he was truthful in his answers to Dr. Foti. When he saw Dr. Foti he did not mention any word-finding difficulties and believed his day-to-day memory was reasonable. Nevertheless he currently asserts that his memory is not as good as it was before the accident.
57  The concussion clinic recommended that he adjust his activity level to avoid multi-tasking. After he made this change he found it easier to cope with his anxiety and headaches, although he feels that he was turning down too much business because of the limitations on his working ability.
58  Initially, he stopped taking on new work when he became confused. His anxiety over minor issues increased. The anxiety occurs mostly when he is in bed and subsides after he arises in the morning.
59  Before the accident he did not have anxiety, but now he feels that he is on the edge. He said that the things that cause anxiety are of no consequence, but he continues to go over and over issues that cause him to become anxious. Working on more than one task at a time seems to contribute to his anxiety.
60  He makes dinner for his wife at approximately 7:00 pm. He retires each night around 9:15 pm and gets up at 5:00 am. His wife does not go to bed until 11:00 pm. He said his intimate life with his wife has dropped off since the accidents. He avoids noisy places such as shopping malls.
61  Dr. Foti prescribed antidepressant medications for Mr. Gillespie; he said amitriptyline has improved his sleep quality, but he continues to have word-finding problems and difficulty recalling names, places, and street names.
62  He said his injuries do not affect his energy levels unless the symptoms become bad, and then he may sit in the dark until he improves. He finds that noisy places such as shopping malls bother him. Large job sites may have as many as seven trades in confined areas which seem to increase his level of stress. As a result, he stopped taking on large projects.
63  By October 2011 Mr. Gillespie was feeling better with improved energy. He could not recall if his condition at the time of trial was changed from how he felt in October 2011. He confirmed that at his examination for discovery of December 12, 2013 he was feeling better and that his cognitive functioning had improved since seeing Dr. Foti.
64  He testified that before the accident he could do a "takeoff", or a quote, in 30 to 60 minutes for a $10,000 project. The same work now takes between 90 and 180 minutes. He forces himself to redo takeoffs as many as three times because of his problems with numbers. If he reproduces a single quotation three times and the results are in the same range, Mr. Gillespie is satisfied with the quotation he has created.
65  He testifed that the risk of making an error on a $100,000 job is beyond his tolerance. On a projoct of that size, a $10,000 mistake would be very serious and too great a risk for him. He testified that he lost $25,000 on a project at UBC due to an installation error. There was no corroborating evidence detailing this loss. He has no memory of losing work due to his poor memory but claimed to have lost work (from Syd Pagliara) due to problems with a customer over pricing. He stopped responding to Syd's projects but continues to work for Syd's son.
66  He said that the reason he accepts only smaller jobs is due to his health; when defendants counsel suggested it was not because of the accident, he answered "I cannot say yes or no". But he believes the larger jobs exacerbate his symptoms.
67  Large jobs take weeks or months to complete whereas the smaller projects can be finished within one or two days.
68  Currently, he gets upset more easily than before the accident and is short with people. He has been told that his tone is aggressive, and he thinks he is slow to admit mistakes when at work and at home. He believes these personality changes and being easily upset has cost him business relationships.
69  He is concerned about changes in his memory; but he is unable to usefully compare his current memory with his capacity before the accident.
70  His current memory problems have not changed from the date of the first accident: they include difficulty in word-finding, reversing numbers, leaving pots on the stove (he has done it twice), needing to make notes, and being anxious about making errors in his project quotations. He believed these symptoms came on at the time of the accident, but he cannot be specific. He complains of ongoing headaches which develop throughout his day; he uses Tylenol medication to ameliorate the symptoms.
71  He was cross-examined about his memory problems. As an example, he had testified at his discovery that his memory difficulties were limited to numbers and names whereas at trial he claimed a much broader range of memory problems. He acknowledged that he could not remember his conversation with Mr. Pingot at the accident scene.
72  Both he and his wife testified that his personality has changed since the accidents. He is more aggressive now and is more easily upset by people and events. She said he has become mean and aggressive at times and can be rude to others. She has observed the plaintiff's difficulty in sleeping since the accident. She said there is a lot of tossing and turning and moaning when he is asleep.
73  Since the accident he uncharacteristically raises his voice in conversation and has become defensive.
74  She has observed difficulties with his memory. He now forgets conversations and appears to struggle with quotations and calculations. She said he leaves the fridge door open, his keys in the front door and leaves taps running and pots on the stove. She said that they talk about their plans on one night and he will have forgotten their discussions the next night.
75  He confirmed that does not experience anxiety during the day; it is confined to early mornings. He is able to enjoy holidays without interference with memory difficulties.
76  He plans to continue taking two holidays each year and to scale back his work until retirement.
77  He said that his injuries have resulted in lower business profits since the accident. In his first full year after the accident (fiscal 2011) his company net profit was $77,726, whereas the 2010 profit was $143,299. In 2012 he decided to put more effort into the projects and his business and the profit increased to $166,921. In 2012 when he was not feeling well, was anxious and was sleeping less; the income nonetheless rose by $90,000 for 2012.
78  He took 20 days off in May 2012 and three weeks off in October 2012 for vacation; these vacations occurred in fiscal 2013. When he returned from his holidays he felt better and was less anxious.
79  Since May 1, 2013 he has increased his workload and described his fiscal 2014 business as good. He said there is a lot of work and more pressure.
80  He could only guess that work now takes double the time he thought was required before the accident. He is no longer confident in giving the type of "rough estimates" he provided before the accident.
81  Mr. Gillespie acknowledged under cross-examination that the last job he turned down due to his injuries and the type of work involved was in August 2011. He testified that he is turning down larger jobs but produced no records of job turn-down despite knowing that in this case he was making a claim for past and future income loss based on those lost jobs.
82  He testified that his wife will retire from her position in three years and that they would like to return to the Okanagan to live. He said he wanted to accumulate between $700,000 and $800,000 in retained earnings in his company to be able to fund his retirement.
83  In sum, Mr. Gillespie's main complaint is that his memory and cognitive function were seriously compromised by the injury to his head and adversely affect his competitiveness in the flooring business.
Medical Evidence
84  The plaintiff relied on the April 30, 2013 written opinion of his family doctor, Dr. Nicole Levis. Dr. Levis appeared at trial and was cross-examined.
85  The plaintiff also relied on the August 28, 2013 written opinion evidence of Dr. E. David, a specialist in Otolaryngology who was initially retained by the defendants. He was not cross-examined.
86  The defendants relied on the September 12, 2013 written opinion of Dr. Andrew Eisen, a neurologist, who appeared at trial and was cross-examined.
Dr. Levis
87  Dr. Levis's written opinions included the following:
Mr. Gillespie was injured in the first accident and diagnosed with a mild traumatic head injury concussion with ongoing post-concussion symptoms. He experiences chronic headaches, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and persistent cognitive impairments;
The collision caused Mr. Gillespie's injuries. He did not have a pre-accident condition that made him more susceptible to injury nor was she aware of pre-existing injuries or conditions. Therefore, she attributed his symptoms to the accident;
His pre-accident diagnosis of hypertension proteinuria did not impact the accident related injuries;
Mr. Gillespie has a vocational disability. His injuries have rendered him able to take on 50% of his previous projects or workload. He is not accepting the larger, complex projects and only accepting the smaller ones. He experiences headaches throughout his work day and makes errors resulting in him rechecking his work more often than before. These impairments are likely to persist into the future;
Mr. Gillespie's injuries affect his recreational, social, household, and daily activities. He has sleep difficulties and anxiety. He does not work out or use an elliptical machine as he did before the collision. He is more irritable and anxious when planning or decision-making;
Mr. Gillespie is likely to require ongoing Tylenol and amitriptyline. Massage therapy may be helpful. Neuropsychological testing might help regarding his cognitive difficulties; and
Mr. Gillespie's symptoms have continued for three years and four months, and complete recovery is unlikely; the symptoms will persist into the future.
88  In cross-examination, Dr. Levis said she relied on Dr. Foti's opinion, i.e., that the plaintiff suffered a mild traumatic brain injury, when preparing her opinion.
89  When Dr. Levis first saw Mr. Gillespie on December 3, 2009, he described to her the sequence of events leading to the collision, the collision itself, the spinning of his car and striking another truck, the airbag deployment, the impact of his head on the windshield and his upper lip on the steering wheel. He said he did not lose consciousness. He was able to describe the events at Burnaby General Hospital, including the repair to his forehead laceration. He also described his headaches, body aches and poor sleep.
90  Dr. Levis's initial opinion was that Mr. Gillespie had a whiplash injury and forehead cut. She did not note any altered state of consciousness. But she opined that his concussion injury had lasted from then to now without improvement, and that the pattern and duration of his head injury is not in the usual course. She said an altered state of consciousness may be indicated if a person is dazed, confused or has mental fog and was suffering decreased memory.
91  Dr. Levis reported that Mr. Gillespie "stated he awoke on December 3, 2009 with a headache and body aches and poor sleep". Mr. Gillespie also complained of bilateral neck pain and rotation with low back pain, but had no blurry vision, tinnitus or dizziness. He did not report having a headache between December 1 and 3, 2009.
92  When Dr. Levis met Mr. Gillespie on December 21, 2009, he described some poor short-term memory, reversing numbers, intermittent headaches relieved by Tylenol, intermittent dizziness, and difficulty with word-finding. Her impression at that visit was post-concussion syndrome, and she referred him for a neurological consultation.
93  Mr. Gillespie told Dr. Levis that his intermittent headaches and sleep disturbances continued into June 2010. By August 30, 2010, he said he was doing well; he was working more hours and experiencing fewer headaches. But he told her that the insomnia was continuing, that he was using Zopiclone to help, and that if he failed to take it, he would wake at 3:00 am.
94  In her examinations of the plaintiff, Dr. Levis did not inquire about any history he might have had with anxiety or sleep issues. She missed reviewing his earlier records where those symptoms had been disclosed previously to his doctor.
Dr. David
95  Dr. David opined that it is likely Mr. Gillespie suffered a post-traumatic left inner ear otolith dysfunction. The mechanism for this injury was a direct impact, acoustic trauma from airbag deployment and explosive forces associated with airbag deployment.
96  Dr. David's opinion was based on an objective balance test that confirmed Mr. Gillespie had an inner ear dysfunction.
97  Dr. David opined that Mr. Gillespie's day-to-day activities are not currently limited due to the deficit because he has a compensatory mechanism that is activated.
98  Dr. David opined that the there is a possibility that the compensatory mechanism can be overridden, and his imbalance may become noticeable. This deficit is also in his opinion a contraindication to Mr. Gillespie working at elevations or around machinery or doing any commercial driving.
99  However, Dr. David opined that Mr. Gillespie achieved complete compensation (but not resolution) for this deficit.
Dr. Eisen
100  Dr. Eisen opined that the plaintiff suffered a whiplash type injury with no neurological deficits or radiological fractures. He reports that both motor vehicle accidents were "of mild nature". He did not believe the plaintiff suffered a mild traumatic brain injury even though he had a forehead laceration.
101  Regarding the second accident, he said this very mild collision aggravated the whiplash symptoms of the neck and back from the first accident. Those symptoms rapidly settled and were no longer a concern. He said that the plaintiff's cognitive symptoms did not commence until after the second accident. He learned from the plaintiff that his cognitive symptoms persisted and possibly worsened. He noted Dr. Foti's comment confirming his mild cognitive dysfunction one year after the accidents. Those deficits were not apparent to him at the time of his examination. Dr. Eisen seems to have accepted that the deficits were evident until January 22, 2011. He has not considered Dr. Levis' comments that cognitive deficits were apparent by December 21, 2009.
102  Dr. Eisen observed that the plaintiff did not stop work; rather he curtailed his work intensity due to memory impairment and lack of concentration. Dr. Eisen opined that Mr. Gillespie's headaches were not cervicogenic and related to the accident; he believed they were related to small vessel disease of the brain called concomitant of metabolic syndrome predating the accident.
103  A head MRI would have been helpful in detecting indications of small vessel disease of the brain, but I note that an MRI did was not done in this case.
104  Dr. Eisen also observed that there was no evidence of Mr. Gillespie experiencing amnesia as was noted by Dr. Foti.
105  Dr. Eisen said that the plaintiff had all four components of metabolic syndrome: abdominal obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose metabolism, and disordered lipid profile. The presence of metabolic syndrome increases the risk of cognitive impairment.
Parties' Submissions
Plaintiff
106  Mr. Gillespie contends that the first accident resulted in cuts to his head, neck, left shoulder, low back, knee and ankle pain. He developed severe, ongoing headaches.
107  Mr. Gillespie claims he suffered a mild traumatic brain injury on the basis of Dr. Levis's evidence. He claims that the injury resulted from his head hitting the car windshield, and his ongoing symptoms resulted from that blow to his head.
108  Mr. Gillespie felt dazed and woozy after the collision.
109  Mr. Gillespie argues that this post-accident conduct demonstrates the injuries of which he now complains result from damage to his brain. When his wife met him at the hospital, Mr. Gillespie was unsteady on his feet and very agitated. She could not have a coherent conversation with him because he did not make sense; he was going off on tangents. He was anxious and wanting to go home. Once at home he was disoriented, agitated and distressed. In short, his behavior was erratic.
110  Dr. Levis confirmed that mild traumatic brain injuries can be diagnosed when a loss of consciousness or alteration of consciousness occurs. An alteration of consciousness means a change in mental status; it could include being woozy, dazed, in a mental fog, confused or experiencing memory loss (I will pause to note that, curiously, this detail was not included in her written report and was only elicited in cross-examination).
111  Mr. Gillespie contends that the symptoms continuing from the date of the accident justify an award for past loss of income and that the amount of those damages should be estimated.
112  Mr. Gillespie also contends that future income loss has been proven because he suffers from cognitive difficulties that require him to triple check his work. He also takes longer to do his estimates, and the stresses and risks associated with large complex jobs have made it untenable for him to accept those types of projects.
113  Before the accident, Mr. Gillespie targeted accumulating retained earnings in his company between $700,000 and $800,000 as the amount needed to retire. Before the accident, his company had $36,472 in retained earnings. In 2010, that account rose to $106,827, and by 2013, it rose to $353,628.
114  Mr. Gillespie claims that if retained earnings continue to increase at $143,000 per year (the amount of increase in the fiscal year ending April 30, 2010) he would have reached his goal by working full time until 2015. These projections translate into a future income loss of $640,000. He calculates his actual post-accident loss for the years ending April 30, 2011, 2012 or 2013 at $309,832 and $103,277 per year. This amount is $59,131 less than his pre-accident capacity.
115  If Mr. Gillespie had continued to work to age 70, his loss of capacity would be $285,997. The plaintiff invited the Court to consider the capital asset approach outlined in Brown v. Golaiy .
116  Mr. Gillespie contends that he is overall less capable of earning income from all types of employment; less marketable or attractive to prospective employers, less able to take advantage of all job opportunities, and less valuable to himself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive market.
117  Mr. Gillespie's claims for special damages are limited to extra strength Tylenol and over-the-counter medication. He takes six to eight tablets per night at a cost of $15 for every 200 tablets. This claim is between $600 - $800.
118  Regarding cost of future care, Mr. Gillespie claims that extra-strength Tylenol will cost between $1,642 and $3,285 depending on his life expectancy.
119  Mr. Gillespie argues that Dr. Eisen's opinion should not be accepted because of his errors in assessing the plaintiff's pre-accident risk factors for metabolic syndrome. He argues that Dr. Eisen erred in concluding that Mr. Gillespie met the criteria for abdominal obesity, untreated hypertension or atherogenic dyslipidemia.
Defendants
120  The defendants argue that the plaintiff suffered mild soft tissue injuries in the December 2009 accident and no injuries from the January 2010 collision.
121  They argue that the plaintiff's evidence was inconsistent between his examination in chief and cross-examination and his discovery testimony. They argue that I should attribute a dishonest motive to the plaintiff and reject his evidence as not credible or reliable.
122  The defendants argue that usual indicia of a traumatic brain injury include evidence of an altered state of consciousness or unconsciousness shortly after injury. The defendants argue that no evidence demonstrates that Mr. Gillespie was experiencing either unconsciousness or altered consciousness in the moments after the collision. Therefore, Dr. Levis erred when she concluded that Mr. Gillespie suffered a brain injury. Indeed, Dr. Levis confirmed that headaches and dizziness are nonspecific symptoms that do not necessarily lead to the conclusion of traumatic brain injury.
123  The defendants contended that Dr. Levis's evidence should not be given great weight. They argue that she is a part-time practitioner who sees an average of five cases of concussion injury per year, and most of those concussions are sports related injuries. She is not a trained neurologist; rather she functions as a patient advocate accepting the complaints as stated without questioning the veracity or reliability of those complaints.
124  The defendants argue that the plaintiff exaggerated the impact of his cognitive deficits on his daily living.
125  The defendants argue that the plaintiff lacked credibility and reliability in his testimony at trial. Although Dr. Levis reported that the plaintiff was a good historian, his testimony at trial was quite inconsistent and suggests that he did not have a good memory.
126  In direct evidence, Mr. Gillespie gave a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision and what transpired at the scene of the accident. He said he got out of the vehicle, walked around, and noticed that the fire department and ambulance arrived. Someone gave him a towel for his head. The ambulance attendants wanted to take him to hospital; he declined in favor of going to Burnaby Hospital with his passenger.
127  At his September 21, 2011 examination for discovery he was asked about the fire department and police attendance at the scene. He responded:
147Q So I understand that the fire department and the police attended the scene; is that correct?
 A  Yes. I believe the first person there was a fire department person. Again, I am just going on what I have been told about it. And then the police arrived and a fire - - and ambulance. Where emergency response vehicle or... 
148Q Do you not recall the fire department or ambulance attending?
 A  Not really. I have very little memory of that at all. I remember the - - being in the emergency response vehicle, but I believe that the first person there was a fire person in his - - in a fire vehicle, not a big fire truck, but I guess like a fire car. And again, I think I am taking most of this from related stories. 
128  Under cross-examination he said that: he did not remember pain to his head or forehead; did not remember being dizzy, nauseous, or suffering back pain, neck pain or headache when he was at Burnaby Hospital.
129  Dr. Levis' records indicate that on December 3, 2009 the plaintiff reported no dizziness and headaches that began the morning of December 3. He did not deny saying this to Dr. Levis but insisted that his headaches and dizziness had begun the day of the accident. The defendants stressed that the discrepancy in the plaintiff's testimony in chief outlining his complaints when he arrived at Burnaby General Hospital and his discovery evidence wherein he lacked a memory of these details ought to erode my confidence in his reliability and credibility.
130  The defendants also contend that the plaintiff's report to Dr. Foti in August 2011 and October 2011 that, his day to day memory was reasonable, his geographic sense and concentration were reasonable, and he occasionally lost his train of thought, are against his complaint of more serious memory and concentration problems. They argue that his report to the concussion clinic that he was 90% recovered as of April 15, 2010 demonstrates the unreliability of his trial testimony.
131  They contend that, in the absence of corroborating evidence to support his claims and given his self-confessed poor memory, Mr. Gillespie has not proven that he suffered a concussion-type injury that impaired his ability to function and altered his personality.
Applicable Law
Expert Evidence
132  Analyzing conflicting medical opinions requires scrutinizing the facts underlying those opinions.
133  Mazur v. Lucas,  is apposite to the issues in this case. It concerned hearsay evidence that experts relied on in forming opinions. At paras. 38-40, the Court said:
 [38]  In Cunningham v. Slubowski,  (CanLII), , Madam Justice MacKenzie (now A.C.J.), described the proper use of clinical records, not otherwise in evidence, in the context of a ruling on the admissibility of those records. Although her ruling pertained to the admissibility of clinical records, part of her ruling is nevertheless apt to this case. She said at para. 13: 
 [13]  Even had the plaintiff complied with s. 42 of the Evidence Act to make the clinical records admissible as business records, the consulting letters to Dr. Abelman of the three specialists to whom he referred the plaintiff amount to expert opinions which are inadmissible because of failure to comply with Rule 40A: F.(K.E.) v. Daoust  (BC CA),  (C.A.); McTavish v. MacGillivray. The proper use of the clinical records is thus very limited in this case: they can be used by the defendants on cross-examination of the plaintiff, by Dr. Abelman himself as notes to refresh his memory while giving evidence at trial, or in cross-examination of Dr. Abelman on his expert report with respect to the foundation for his opinion. The latter use would include reference to the plaintiff's statements and the opinion of other specialists, but not for proof of the content of those statements and opinions. 
 [39]  As Watt J. observed after canvassing the jurisprudence on hearsay-based opinions in R. v. Palma,  (Ont. S.C.J.), there has not been "any reasoned departure from the principles stated and reiterated by the Supreme Court of Canada over the better part of three decades". This treatment of hearsay contained in an expert opinion as relevant to weight rather than admissibility has also been commented upon favourably by leading Canadian scholars in the field of evidence (see David Paciocco and L. Steusser, The Law of Evidence, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2008) at 211-213; Alan Bryant et al., The Law of Evidence in Canada, 3rd ed. (Markham, Ont.: LexisNexis, 2009) at 838-849). Likewise, the notion of a relaxed hearsay rule in the context of expert evidence is reflected in the model civil jury instructions: R. Dean Wilson et al. CIVJI: Civil Jury Instructions, loose-leaf at s.<check-sect/> 4.20.8, which reads: 
Second, where [the expert witness] gave (his/ her) opinion, it was based (entirely/in part) on statements made to (him/her) by others who were not called to give evidence in this trial, such as [specify].
Because the person(s) who made these statements did not give evidence before you, the opinion of [the expert witness] is founded (entirely/in part) on hearsay evidence.
Normally, hearsay evidence is not admissible for any purpose, but in the case of an expert, the rule is not quite so strict. You may examine this hearsay evidence for the purpose of deciding the weight you will give the opinion of [the expert witness]. You cannot regard that hearsay evidence as evidence of the truth of what is alleged to have been said. However you may use it for the purpose of assessing the weight of the evidence of [the expert witness].
 [40]  From these authorities, I would summarize the law on this question as to the admissibility of expert reports containing hearsay evidence as follows: 
* An expert witness may rely on a variety of sources and resources in opining on the question posed to him. These may include his own intellectual resources, observations or tests, as well as his review of other experts' observations and opinions, research and treatises, information from others -- this list is not exhaustive. (See Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, at 834-835)
* An expert may rely on hearsay. One common example in a personal injury context would be the observations of a radiologist contained in an x-ray report. Another physician may consider it unnecessary to view the actual x-ray himself, preferring to rely on the radiologist's report.
* The weight the trier of fact ultimately places on the opinion of the expert may depend on the degree to which the underlying assumptions have been proven by other admissible evidence. The weight of the expert opinion may also depend on the reliability of the hearsay, where that hearsay is not proven by other admissible evidence. Where the hearsay evidence (such as the opinion of other physicians) is an accepted means of decision making within that expert's expertise, the hearsay may have greater reliability.
* The correct judicial response to the question of the admissibility of hearsay evidence in an expert opinion is not to withdraw the evidence from the trier of fact unless, of course, there are some other factors at play such that it will be prejudicial to one party, but rather to address the weight of the opinion and the reliability of the hearsay in an appropriate self-instruction or instruction to a jury.
[Emphasis added.]
134  And at paras. 34-36, the Court addressed R. v. Lavallee,  and R. v. Abbey, , namely in examining the issue of where an expert relies on information for which no admissible evidence exists:
34  Madam Justice Wilson extracted the following principles from Abbey (at 893): 
An expert opinion is admissible if relevant, even if it is based on second-hand evidence.
This second-hand evidence (hearsay) is admissible to show the information on which the expert opinion is based, not as evidence going to the existence of the facts on which the opinion is based.
Where the psychiatric evidence is comprised of hearsay evidence, the problem is the weight to be attributed to the opinion.
Before any weight can be given to an expert's opinion, the facts upon which the opinion is based must be found to exist.
And she concluded (at 896-897):
In my view, as long as there is some admissible evidence to establish the foundation for the expert's opinion, the trial judge cannot subsequently instruct the jury to completely ignore the testimony. The judge must, of course, warn the jury that the more the expert relies on facts not proved in evidence the less weight the jury may attribute to the opinion...
Where the factual basis of an expert's opinion is a melange of admissible and inadmissible evidence the duty of the trial judge is to caution the jury that the weight attributable to the expert testimony is directly related to the amount and quality of admissible evidence on which it relies.
 [35]  Mr. Justice Sopinka concurred with Wilson J. in the result in Lavallee, but made some clarifying remarks which are relevant to the present appeal. In his view, the four propositions from Abbey concerning the admissibility and weight of expert opinion evidence may yield a result which is self-contradictory (at 898-899): 
The combined effect of numbers 1, 3 and 4 is that an expert opinion relevant in the abstract to a material issue in a trial but based entirely on unproven hearsay (e.g., from the mouth of the accused, as in Abbey) is admissible but entitled to no weight whatsoever. The question that arises is how any evidence can be admissible and yet entitled to no weight. As one commentator has pointed out, an expert opinion based entirely on unproven hearsay must, if anything, be inadmissible by reason of irrelevance, since the facts underlying the expert opinion are the only connection between the opinion and the case: see Wardle, "R. v. Abbey and Psychiatric Opinion Evidence: Requiring the Accused to Testify" (1984), 17 Ottawa L. Rev. 116, at pp. 122-23.
 [36]  To resolve the contradiction, he drew a practical distinction between evidence that an expert obtains and acts upon within the scope of his or her expertise and evidence that an expert obtains from a party to litigation touching a matter directly in issue (at 899-900): 
In the former instance, an expert arrives at an opinion on the basis of forms of enquiry and practice that are accepted means of decision within that expertise. A physician, for example, daily determines questions of immense importance on the basis of the observations of colleagues, often in the form of second- or third-hand hearsay. For a court to accord no weight to, or to exclude, this sort of professional judgment, arrived at in accordance with sound medical practices, would be to ignore the strong circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness that surround it, and would be, in my view, contrary to the approach this Court has taken to the analysis of hearsay evidence in general, exemplified in Ares v. Venner,  (SCC),  (SCC), . In R. v. Jordan  (B.C.C.A.), a case concerning an expert's evaluation of the chemical composition of an alleged heroin specimen, Anderson J.A. held, and I respectfully agree, that Abbey does not apply in such circumstances. (See also R. v. Zundel  (ON CA),  (ON CA),  (Ont. C.A.), at p. 52, where the court recognized an expert opinion based upon evidence "... of a general nature which is widely used and acknowledged as reliable by experts in that field.")
Where, however, the information upon which an expert forms his or her opinion comes from the mouth of a party to the litigation, or from any other source that is inherently suspect, a court ought to require independent proof of that information. The lack of such proof will, consistent with Abbey, has a direct effect on the weight to be given to the opinion, perhaps to the vanishing point. But it must be recognized that it will only be very rarely that an expert's opinion is entirely based upon such information, with no independent proof of any of it. Where an expert's opinion is based in part upon suspect information and in part upon either admitted facts or facts sought to be proved, the matter is purely one of weight.
[Emphasis added.]
Credibility and Reliability of Evidence
135  In Bradshaw v. Stenner,  at para. 186, Dillon J. analyzed the factors to be considered when assessing credibility:
[186] Credibility involves an assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness' testimony based upon the veracity or sincerity of a witness and the accuracy of the evidence that the witness provides (Raymond v. Bosanquet (Township) ,  (S.C.C.)). The art of assessment involves examination of various factors such as the ability and opportunity to observe events, the firmness of his memory, the ability to resist the influence of interest to modify his recollection, whether the witness' evidence harmonizes with independent evidence that has been accepted, whether the witness changes his testimony during direct and cross-examination, whether the witness' testimony seems unreasonable, impossible, or unlikely, whether a witness has a motive to lie, and the demeanour of a witness generally (Wallace v. Davis,  (Ont. H.C.); Faryna v. Chorny,  (B.C.C.A.) [Faryna]; R. v. S.(R.D.),  at para.128 (S.C.C.)). Ultimately, the validity of the evidence depends on whether the evidence is consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole and shown to be in existence at the time (Faryna at para. 356).
136  In Andrusko v. Alexander, , Fitzpatrick J. said at para. 49:
If the plaintiff's account of his or her change in physical, mental, and or emotional state as a result of the accident is not convincing, then the hypothesis upon which any expert opinions rest will be undermined: Samuel v. Chrysler Credit Canada Ltd., , at paras. 15, 49-50.
Causation
137  A plaintiff must establish on a balance of probabilities that the defendant's negligence caused or materially contributed to an injury. The defendant's negligence need not be the sole cause of the injury so long as it is part of the cause beyond the de minimus range. Causation need not be determined by scientific precision: Athey v. Leonati,  at paras. 13-17 [Athey].
138  The primary test for causation asks: but-for the defendant's negligence, would the plaintiff have suffered the injury? The "but-for" test recognizes that compensation for negligent conduct should only be made where a substantial connection between the injury and the defendant's conduct is present: Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke,  at paras. 21-23.
139  Causation must be established on a balance of probabilities before damages are assessed. As McLachlin C.J.C. said in Blackwater v. Plint,  at para. 78:
... Even though there may be several tortious and non-tortious causes of injury, so long as the defendant's act is a cause of the plaintiff's damage, the defendant is fully liable for that damage. The rules of damages then consider what the original position of the plaintiff would have been. The governing principle is that the defendant need not put the plaintiff in a better position than his original position and should not compensate the plaintiff for any damages he would have suffered anyway: [Athey v. Leonati].
140  The basic goal of tort law to restore an injured person to the position he or she would have been if not for the defendant's negligence, no better or worse. The tortfeasor must take his victim as they are when the injury happens, even if the plaintiff's injuries are more severe than they would be for a normal person (the thin skull rule). However, the defendant need not compensate the plaintiff for any debilitating effects of a pre-existing condition which the plaintiff would have experienced anyway (the crumbling skull rule): Athey at paras. 32-35.
Non-Pecuniary Damages
141  Non-pecuniary damages are awarded to compensate injured people for pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of amenities. Compensation must be fair and reasonable to reflect the impact of injuries on the past and future lives of victims of the negligence of others.
142  Fairness is measured against awards made in comparable cases but although those cases are helpful, they only represent a reference for the assessment of the facts unique to each person.
143  In Stapley v. Hejslet, , Kirkpatrick J.A. outlined some of the important factors to be considered when assessing non-pecuniary damages at para. 46:
The inexhaustive list of common factors cited in Boyd [Boyd v. Harris, ] that influence an award of non-pecuniary damages includes:
age of the plaintiff;
nature of the injury;
severity and duration of pain;
disability;
emotional suffering; and
loss or impairment of life;
I would add the following factors, although they may arguably be subsumed in the above list:
impairment of family, marital and social relationships;
impairment of physical and mental abilities;
loss of lifestyle; and
the plaintiff's stoicism (as a factor that should not, generally speaking, penalize the plaintiff: Giang v. Clayton, ).
144  The measure of non-pecuniary damages must reflect the injured person's personal experiences in coping with injuries and their consequences, and the plaintiff's ability to articulate that experience: Dilello v. Montgomery,  at para. 25 [Dilello].
Past Income Loss
145  Compensation for past loss of earning capacity is to be based on what the plaintiff would have, not could have, earned but for the injury that was sustained: Rowe v. Bobell Express Ltd.,  at para. 30; M.B. v. British Columbia, .
146  In Smith v. Knudsen,  the Court said at para. 29:
That instruction accurately reflects the distinction made in the case authorities between proof of actual events and proof of future or hypothetical events. What would have happened in the past but for the injury is no more "knowable" than what will happen in the future and therefore it is appropriate to assess the likelihood of hypothetical and future events rather than applying the balance of probabilities test that is applied with respect to past actual events.
147  The burden of proof of actual past events is on a balance of probabilities. An assessment of loss of both past and future earning capacity involves consideration of hypothetical events. The plaintiff is not required to prove these hypothetical events on a balance of probabilities. The future or hypothetical possibility will be taken into consideration as long as it is a real and substantial possibility and not mere speculation: Drodge v. Kozak,  at para. 148 [Drodge].
148  This analysis involves estimating and not calculating the loss: Steward v. Berezen,  at para. 7.
Loss of Future Earning Capacity
149  A claim for loss of future earning capacity raises two key questions: 1) has the plaintiff's earning capacity been impaired by his or her injuries; and, 2) if the plaintiff is impaired, what compensation should be awarded for the resulting financial harm that will accrue over time? The assessment of loss must be based on the evidence, and not an application of a purely mathematical calculation. The appropriate means of assessment will vary from case to case: Brown v. Golaiy,  (S.C.) [Brown]; Pallos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia,  (S.C.) [Pallos]; Pett v. Pett, .
150  The assessment of damages is also a matter of judgment, not calculation: Rosvold v. Dunlop,  at para. 18.
151  As much as possible, the plaintiff should be put in the position he would have been in but for the injuries caused by the defendant's negligence: Lines v. W & D Logging Co. Ltd.,  at para. 185.
152  The essential task of the Court is to compare the likely future of the plaintiff's working life if the accident had not happened with the plaintiff's likely future working life after the accident: Gregory v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia,  at para. 32.
153  In Perren v. Lalari,  [Perren], the Court described the plaintiff's burden of proof to succeed in this claim at para. 32:
A plaintiff must always prove, as was noted by Donald J.A. in Steward, by Bauman J. in Chang, and by Tysoe J.A. in Romanchych, that there is a real and substantial possibility of a future event leading to an income loss. If the plaintiff discharges that burden of proof, then depending upon the facts of the case, the plaintiff may prove the quantification of that loss of earning capacity, either on an earnings approach, as in Steenblok, or a capital asset approach, as in Brown. The former approach will be more useful when the loss is more easily measurable, as it was in Steenblok. The latter approach will be more useful when the loss is not as easily measurable, as in Pallos and Romanchych. A plaintiff may indeed be able to prove that there is a substantial possibility of a future loss of income despite having returned to his or her usual employment. That was the case in both Pallos and Parypa. But, as Donald J.A. said in Steward, an inability to perform an occupation that is not a realistic alternative occupation is not proof of a future loss.
154  The two possible approaches to assessment of loss of future earning capacity are the "earnings approach" and the "capital asset approach": Brown.
155  The capital asset approach involves considering factors such as:
whether the plaintiff has been rendered less capable overall of earning income from all types of employment;
is less marketable or attractive as a potential employee;
has lost the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities that might otherwise have been open; and,
is less valuable to herself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour market: Brown; Gilbert v. Bottle,  at para. 233.
156  The earnings approach involves a form of math-oriented methodology such as: (1) postulating a minimum annual income loss for the plaintiff's remaining years of work, multiplying the annual projected loss by the number of remaining years and calculating a present value; or (2) awarding the plaintiff's entire annual income for a year or two: Pallos.
157  Both approaches are correct and will be more or less appropriate depending on whether the loss in question can be quantified in a measureable way: Perren.
158  The principles that apply in assessing loss of future earning capacity were summarized in Reilly v. Lynn,  at para. 101:
The relevant principles may be briefly summarized. The standard of proof in relation to future events is simple probability, not the balance of probabilities, and hypothetical events are to be given weight according to their relative likelihood: Athey v. Leonati,  at para. 27. A plaintiff is entitled to compensation for real and substantial possibilities of loss, which are to be quantified by estimating the chance of the loss occurring: Athey v. Leonati, supra, at para. 27, Steenblok v. Funk  at 135 (C.A.). The valuation of the loss of earning capacity may involve a comparison of what the plaintiff would probably have earned but for the accident with what he will probably earn in his injured condition: Milina v. Bartsch  at 93 (S.C.). However, that is not the end of the inquiry; the overall fairness and reasonableness of the award must be considered: Rosvold v. Dunlop ,  at para. 11; Ryder v. Paquette,  (C.A.) . Moreover, the task of the Court is to assess the losses, not to calculate them mathematically: Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate  (C.A.). Finally, since the course of future events is unknown, allowance must be made for the contingency that the assumptions upon which the award is based may prove to be wrong: Milina v. Bartsch, supra, at 79. In adjusting for contingencies, the remarks of Dickson J. in Andrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd., supra, at 253, are a useful guide:
First, in many respects, these contingencies implicitly are already contained in an assessment of the projected average level of earnings of the injured person, for one must assume that this figure is a projection with respect to the real world of work, vicissitudes and all. Second, not all contingencies are adverse ... Finally, in modern society there are many public and private schemes which cushion the individual against adverse contingencies. Clearly, the percentage deduction which is proper will depend on the facts of the individual case, particularly the nature of the plaintiff's occupation, but generally it will be small ...
Cost of Future Care
159  A plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the cost of future care based on what is reasonably necessary to restore him to his pre-accident condition in so far as that is possible.
160  The test for determining the appropriate award under the heading of cost of future care is an objective one based on medical evidence. For an award of future care: (1) medical evidence must justify claims for cost of future care; and (2) the claims must be reasonable: Milina v. Bartsch,  (S.C.) at para. 199 [Milina].
161  Future care costs must be justified both because they are medically necessary and they are likely to be incurred by the plaintiff. The award of damages is thus a matter of prediction as to what will happen in future. If a plaintiff has not used a particular item or service in the past it may be inappropriate to include its cost in a future care award: Izony v. Weidlich,  at para. 74.
Special Damages
162  An injured person is entitled to recover the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses they incurred as a result of an accident. The fundamental governing principle is that an injured person is to be restored to the position he or she would have been in had the accident not occurred: X. v. Y.,  at para. 281.
Discussion
1. Should I draw an adverse inference against the plaintiff for failing to call Dr. Foti?
163  I conclude that the circumstances surrounding Dr. Foti's involvement in the plaintiff's treatment and his failure to adduce evidence from Dr. Foti do not warrant the drawing of an adverse inference.
164  The defence contends that an adverse inference should be drawn by reason of the plaintiff's failure to adduce evidence from Dr. Foti.
165  The plaintiff relies on MacKenzie J.'s comments in Lipinski v. Mein,  [Lipinski]. In that case, the Court refused to draw an adverse inference regarding orthopedic surgeons who were not called at trial but who provided consultation reports to the family doctor. The Court said that it had no reason to draw an adverse inference because the orthopedic surgeons had seen the plaintiff only once. The Court concluded that the family doctor was able to rely on the orthopedic surgeons' opinions, but the absence of their opinions was a matter of weight to be accorded to the family doctor's opinion since she relied on their opinions.
166  The defendants submit that the current approach to adverse inferences in injury cases was addressed in Buksh v. Miles, . Saunders J.A. said at para. 33:
However, it bears reminding that the delivery of medical care is not now as it was in 1964 when Mr. Justice Davey made his comments in Barker. There is, today, a proliferation of "walk-in" medical clinics where the role of the "walk-in" clinic physician may be more limited than was the role of a family physician in 1964. Further, even people who have a family doctor may attend one or more such clinics as a matter of convenience, but still rely upon their family physician for core medical advice and treatment. The proposition stated by Mr. Justice Davey does not anticipate this present model of medicalcare. Likewise, the discovery process available to both sides of a lawsuit is not now as it was in 1964 when, in explaining his view on the need to call all treating physicians, Mr. Justice Davey referred to the professional confidence between a doctor and the patient. Today, the free exchange of information and provision of clinical records through document discovery raises the possibility that an adverse inference may be sought in circumstances where it is known to counsel asking for the inference that the opinion of the doctor in question was not adverse to the opposite party.
[Emphasis added]
167  Saunders J.A. described the type of detail that should be considered in determining whether an adverse inference might be made:
 [35]  In this environment, and bearing in mind the position of a lawyer bound to be truthful to the court, it seems to me there is a threshold question that must be addressed before the instruction on adverse inferences is given to the jury: whether, given the evidence before the court, given the explanations proffered for not calling the witness, given the nature of the evidence that could be provided by the witness, given the extent of disclosure of that physician's clinical notes, and given the circumstances of the trial (e.g., an initial agreement to introduce clinical records that work contrary to the inference, or incorporation of that witness's views or observations in the report of a witness called by the other side) a juror could reasonably draw the inference that the witness not called would have given evidence detrimental to the party's case. 
[Emphasis added]
168  Lipinski is apposite to this case. Dr. Foti saw Mr. Gillespie only twice and his records were available to the defence. His opinion was contained in his consultation report to Dr. Levis and in the records relied on by Dr. Levis; the extent to which Dr. Levis relied on that opinion goes to the weight of Dr. Levis's evidence. Dr. Eisen also referred to the findings in Dr. Foti's consultation report.
169  I observe from the documents that Dr. Foti's opinion was not adverse to Mr. Gillespie's claim.
170  In my view the comments in Buksh regarding the revelation of a favorable opinion to the plaintiff from documents produced in the litigation are meant to inform the Court that, where a favorable opinion exists but is not produced in the trial, it would be unreasonable to draw an adverse inference due to the absence of such an opinion which is known to the parties to support the plaintiff. The discovery process is in place to shield the defendant from any prejudice that might result if a plaintiff obtains and withholds an adverse opinion from a treating doctor.
171  The weight of Dr. Levis's opinion may be adversely affected by the fact that Dr. Foti's evidence was an important feature in forming her opinion but was not tested in the trial. After considering these aspects to the defendants' request, I conclude that this is not an appropriate case to draw an adverse inference against the plaintiff for not adducing Dr. Foti's opinion and I will not draw such an inference.
2. How much weight should I give the expert medical evidence?
172  After hearing submissions on this issue and carefully examining the expert medical evidence, I give Dr. Levis's opinion diminished weight, and Dr. Eisen's opinion very little weight on the issue of metabolic syndrome.
173  Dr. David's evidence was tendered by the plaintiff and not challenged in any way; I give considerable weight to his opinions but I do not find them determinative of the main issues regarding the head injury.
174  I will examine each opinion in turn to explain why I prefer Dr. Levis's opinion notwithstanding its diminished weight.
Dr. Levis
175  Dr. Levis's letter raises significant issues regarding her opinion.
176  As an example, she concluded that Mr. Gillespie suffered injuries because of the accident, but she framed her opinion in an odd form; she said "he was diagnosed with mild traumatic head injury (concussion)" suggesting that the diagnosis was made by someone else. In cross-examination she clarified that it was her personal opinion that Mr. Gillespie suffered a traumatic head injury.
177  Dr. Levis referred the plaintiff to Dr. Foti, a neurologist, and appended a copy of his consultation report to her report. She said she relied on that opinion but Dr. Foti did not provide an opinion in the trial, and he was obviously not cross-examined on his opinion.
178  Dr. Levis has no special training in head injury medicine other than in her training as a family practitioner. She described her training as a family doctor and said she assesses head injury claims, on average, five times per year and usually in regard to sports injuries.
179  It is troubling that Dr. Levis relied on the Dr. Foti's neurological opinion without the plaintiff offering Dr. Foti for cross-examination. Indeed, his opinion goes to the heart of the issue to be decided in this case. The most salient factor described in both Dr. Eisen's evidence and Dr. Levis's evidence is the importance of identifying the presence of an altered state of consciousness shortly after the incident as a precondition diagnosing a brain injury following an accident.
180  I have not drawn an adverse inference from the fact that Dr. Foti did not testify, but Dr. Levis's opinion is, for that reason, less helpful. Because Dr. Levis relied on the Dr. Foti's opinion, I must assess the weight to be given to her opinion insofar as she has relied on hearsay evidence: Mazur at para. 40.
181  For the following reasons I accord diminished weight to her opinion based on several issues with the material she relied on.
182  Dr. Foti described Mr. Gillespie as being dazed at the scene with a brief amnesic period and imprecision in his recollection of the sequence of events in the following days. It does not appear to me that the evidence given by Mr. Gillespie supports the assumptions cited by Dr. Foti.
183  Dr. Levis's account of what the plaintiff told her on December 3, 2009 at this point differs from Dr. Foti.
184  Dr. Levis testified that in her December 3, 2009 meeting with the plaintiff, he was a good historian, and he had no troubling memory gaps in his account of the accident. She did not record any evidence of an altered state of consciousness after the accident.
185  Moreover, in her initial consultation with Mr. Gillespie, she did not report any concern about a concussion sustained by the plaintiff. She said he did not have dizziness. On her December 21 consultation, he described poor short term memory, reversing numbers and intermittent headaches. At "this visit" she concluded his diagnosis was "most likely post-concussion syndrome".
186  When pressed on the issue, Dr. Levis agreed that the first indication in her notes that Mr. Gillespie had suffered an alteration in consciousness was on February 8, 2010. Clearly, that date is well after her initial consultation.
187  In her February 8, 2011 consultation request to the concussion clinic, Dr. Levis said that the plaintiff did not suffer post-traumatic amnesia or a loss of consciousness within 30 minutes of the accident. This is directly contrary to Dr. Foti's assumption that Mr. Gillespie did suffer amnesia. Further in her note to the clinic she said the plaintiff had been dazed or confused and had suffered a concussion. It appears her comment could only have been based on Mr. Gillespie's self-report of things on December 21 and not December 3. She did not mention when his confusion or dazed state began or ended. Dr. Levis's first note of the plaintiff's memory problems was on December 21, 2009.
188  Dr. Levis did not speak with the plaintiff's wife about his symptoms until several years later. I would have expected his wife to have been an important source of information when Dr. Levis was considering the possibility of a head injury.
189  In other words, Dr. Levis did not diagnose an altered state of consciousness or a brain injury in 2009 or in early 2010; the first mention that he was "dazed or confused" was in her report to the clinic was on February 8, 2011.
190  Her opinion that the plaintiff had cognitive impairments due to a head injury is based on Mr. Gillespie's self-report and Dr. Foti's opinion. She said that Mr. Gillespie reported dizziness and headaches as "off and on" symptoms. Dr. Levis agreed that headaches, dizziness and cognitive difficulties are not specific indicators of brain injury, but in the current era of the head injury, they are also not required to diagnosis a brain injury. Nonetheless, she agreed that headaches, dizziness and cognitive difficulties can be consistent with whiplash type injuries and soft tissue strains.
191  Dr. Levis said that during her August 30, 2010 meeting with the plaintiff she assessed that his injury was improving and that he was doing well. She concurred that the usual course of recovery from a head injury is for the worst symptoms to appear shortly after the incident with gradual recovery over the ensuing six months. Dr. Levis confirmed that, with head injury victims, improvement occurs over time, and concussion symptoms do not usually regress. If a relapse occurs, physicians will usually look for an alternative explanation.
192  It is significant that on August 8, 2011, Dr. Foti described the plaintiff's condition to include chronic headaches with migraine features along with persistent cognitive symptoms and reduced concentration. He believed that Mr. Gillespie's headaches could improve with a migraine preventer and suggested neuropsychological testing to look for subtle cognitive deficits.
193  Dr. Foti saw the plaintiff in October 2011; he said "his severe headaches have resolved but he still has a mild background headache. He is not experiencing any dry mouth or lightheaded symptoms". His sleep pattern had improved to six hours before he would become restless. He was not tired in the morning and he felt better cognitively. When she saw him on November 14, 2011 he was generally feeling well with less headaches and better sleep. When she saw him on January 9, 2012 his medication was improving his sleep but he had "occasional tweaking and headaches".
194  Dr. Levis did not particularize which parts of Dr. Foti's consultation opinion informed her own opinion other than that her acceptance of his diagnosis that he likely suffered a mild traumatic brain injury. It is unclear what part of the temporal connection between the plaintiff's symptoms in the accident played in the formation of Dr. Levis's opinion.
195  In January 2013 Mr. Gillespie had run out of amitriptyline medication and was noticing poor sleep, headaches and increased anxiety.
196  Dr. Levis's opines that his prognosis for complete recovery of his cognitive impairment persisting and ongoing headaches, irritability, interrupted sleep, is unlikely. Although I have some concerns regarding the flaws in Dr. Levis's opinions, hers is the only evidence I have that addresses Mr. Gillespie's symptoms as resulting from the accident. On the balance of probabilities, her opinion is sufficient to establish that he will endure the effects of his injuries indefinitely.
Dr. Eisen
197  For reasons advanced by the plaintiff, I place little weight on Dr. Eisen's opinion that Mr. Gillespie's symptoms are the result of metabolic syndrome.
198  Dr. Eisen was qualified to give opinion evidence in the field of neurological medicine, including diagnosing and treating mild traumatic brain injuries and the cognitive effects of metabolic syndrome. He was also qualified to give opinions regarding whiplash injuries from a neurological viewpoint.
199  Dr. Eisen had extensive qualifications in his field, beginning with graduation from medical school in 1966 and completing his neurology residency in 1970. He acquired traumatic brain injury experience and clinical practice at McGill University and UBC. He was head of the neurology division at Vancouver General Hospital and the acting head of the department of medicine, and he also engaged in numerous professional societies, university committees, editorial boards, research and supervision of postdoctoral fellows.
200  Dr. Eisen was cross-examined on several articles addressing the diagnosis and features of mild traumatic brain injuries and metabolic syndrome. As I will mention later, I found that part of his evidence quite helpful.
201  Under his summary and conclusions, Dr. Eisen addressed Mr. Gillespie's cognitive problems and said the following:
he believed the plaintiff suffered a whiplash type injury in the December 2009 accident graded as a I-II (no neurological deficit or radiological fractures). He did not believe that Mr. Gillespie suffered a head injury (mild) in the accident even though he sustained a frontal scalp laceration;
the second accident aggravated his whiplash symptoms, neck and back pain;
Mr. Gillespie did not stop working; rather he curtailed his work intensity because of memory impairment and lack of concentration that Mr. Gillespie said resulted from the December 2009 accident. Dr. Eisen confirmed the plaintiff suffered from mild cognitive dysfunction in September 2013. Dr. Foti more than a year after the accident, described the plaintiff as suffering cognitive deficits with accompanying chronic headaches;
the plaintiff's cognitive impairment is independent of either motor vehicle accident; rather it is due to small vessel disease of the brain being impacted by the metabolic syndrome. The plaintiff has all four components of the disorder, namely obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose metabolism, and disordered lipid profile; and,
the plaintiff's background indicates he is at risk for cardiovascular events, transient ischemic attacks, strokes and progressive dementia.
202  Dr. Eisen's report described both accidents as being "of a mild nature".
203  He did not view photographs of the plaintiff's car in the first accident until after he presented his report. He was not aware his car was a total loss or that there was <damage type = "other">$4,900</damage> damage to the taxi and <damage type = "other">$6,900</damage> damage to the cube van. Although the doctor described the plaintiff's windshield as "shattered" he did not know where he obtained that information.
204  Although the second accident was evidently quite minor, in my view, Dr. Eisen was clearly in error in describing the December 2009 accident this way. Although no questions were asked to clarify "mild" "moderate" or "severe" the evidence points to the first accident being in the range of two moderate collisions involving two impacts. Dr. Eisen did not view the photographs of the damage to the three vehicles nor understand the force of impact that led to Mr. Gillespie striking his head. The apparent damage to all three vehicles, the blow to his head, and the description of the impacts during the accident are inconsistent with Dr. Eisen's conclusion that this was a mild impact collision.
205  In this regard I conclude that Dr. Eisen's opinion was based on a clear misapprehension of the accident and the injury mechanism. This factor alone diminishes the weight of his report.
206  The evidence is uncontroversial that Mr. Gillespie's head struck and shattered the windshield in spite of the airbag deploying.
207  I observed that Dr. David concluded that Mr. Gillespie's inner ear dysfunction occurred because of direct impact, acoustic trauma from airbag deployment, and the explosive forces associated with airbag deployment.
208  Dr. Eisen formed his opinion that Mr. Gillespie's ongoing cognitive symptoms following the accident are the product of metabolic syndrome based on his assumptions that Gillespie's past and ongoing health included evidence that he was diabetic and had impaired glucose function, was obese, had untreated hypertension, and had impaired lipid metabolism. He described his condition of metabolic syndrome on the basis of those four factors.
209  In cross-examination, Dr. Eisen acknowledged:
the plaintiff did not meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes because his Fasting Blood Sugar reading was never greater than seven and his hemoglobin A1C was never greater than 6.5 M. Therefore, he clarified by saying that the plaintiff was pre-diabetic, and he acknowledged that he was wrong in stating that Mr. Gillespie was diabetic;
that he assumed that the plaintiff was abdominally obese for the purposes of diagnosing metabolic syndrome. He acknowledged that he had not measured the plaintiff's abdominal obesity and that there was no evidence of Mr. Gillespie being abdominally obese. When confronted with the fact that the accepted definition of obesity requires a body mass index ("BMI") of 30 he acknowledged that the plaintiff's BMI of 26.6 failed to meet the test and he was wrong in concluding that Mr. Gillespie was obese;
that he said Mr. Gillespie's impaired glucose function was a further feature supporting his metabolic syndrome diagnosis. Under cross-examination, however, counsel took Dr. Eisen to that part of the authoritative study that established that a linear association between fasting glucose and subclinical cerebrovascular disease is established only when the patient's education is less than Grade 12. Indeed, when education levels exceed Grade 12, the literature does not support the association between insulin resistance and the disease (in passing, I will note, Mr. Gillespie graduated Grade 12 and attended Vancouver City College);
that untreated hypertension is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. However the plaintiff was being treated for hypertension; and,
that the fourth component of metabolic syndrome is impaired lipid metabolism/atherogenic dyslipidemia. On this point, the plaintiff began treatment for hypertension on May 16, 2011, and treatment began two days after his blood test showed a 4.1 reading. That reading was significantly below the risk range.
210  He described metabolic syndrome as a vascular condition affecting small blood vessels in the brain. These vessels bleed and can lead to larger lesions that may be visible on MRI scans.
211  Not only was the expert's opinion based on a clear misapprehension of the accident and the initial injury mechanism but also, in the end, Dr. Eisen's analysis of the underlying data was so flawed that his opinion that the plaintiff suffered from metabolic syndrome is markedly unreliable.
212  In his testimony, Dr. Eisen agreed that mild traumatic brain injuries can be diagnosed if the subject has demonstrated some confusion, disorientation and slow thinking. Indeed, an accident victim who is agitated speaks without making sense, is incoherent, fleets from subject to subject, and is disoriented may be exhibiting the type of altered mental state that defines a brain injury.
213  Dr. Eisen said that a mental state described as being a type of "brownout" might indicate an altered state of consciousness that in turn confirms the presence of a head injury.
214  Dr. Eisen also agreed that certain symptoms - e.g., headaches, dizziness, irritability, anxiety, personality change, fatigue, sleep disturbance, decreased libido, memory dysfunction and impaired concentration and attention - might indicate a head injury.
215  Dr. Eisen said that he, before examining the plaintiff, prepared a draft report based on documents that counsel provided to him. He did not produce a copy of that document to the plaintiff before this trial nor did he produce a copy of it at his cross-examination.
216  Dr. Eisen's opinion that the plaintiff did not suffer a brain injury or concussion was based on his assumption that the plaintiff's cognitive impairment lasted for one to two weeks after the collision and then disappeared. He believed that it was 11 or 12 months later that the plaintiff's cognitive symptoms of short-term memory loss, loss of concentration and sleep impairment returned.
217  However, Dr. Eisen seems to have ignored that Dr. Levis, Fraser Health Concussion Clinic and Dr. Foti recorded the plaintiff's complaints of short-term memory loss, reversing numbers, headaches, dizziness, and difficulty word-finding from December 21, 2009 until October 2011. Clearly, his cognitive problems persisted throughout the months after the accident without abatement; they did not re-emerge 11 -12 months later as assumed by Dr. Eisen. This error by Dr. Eisen relating to his ongoing cognitive impairment would likely have affected his opinion if he had relied on more accurate information.
218  Dr. Eisen's misconstruction of the facts leading to his conclusion that the plaintiff did not suffer a head injury in December 2009 is a significant flaw in his opinion. Further, his opinion that Mr. Gillespie developed unrelated cognitive problems in 2011 because he was experiencing metabolic syndrome is not supported by the facts or his own opinion that some of the indications of Mr. Gillespie's altered state of mind in the interval after the accident were indications of an accident related to mild traumatic brain injury.
219  While I treat his report with little to no weight, Dr. Eisen helpfully corroborated some things that Dr. Levis said, and I found that the following comments assist the Court.
220  Dr. Eisen confirmed as authoritative the conclusions in RW Evans, "Post-Traumatic Headaches" (2004) 22:1 Neurologic Clinics 237, that headaches are common occurrences following head trauma. He agreed that headaches, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, loss of concentration/memory, and noise sensitivity are the most common complaints of persons suffering post-concussion syndrome. Although he believed that the estimate that 50% of patients with head injuries display these symptoms was high, he accepted that these are the most common complaints that can persist for more than six months. He accepted that headaches can produce cognitive difficulties.
221  Dr. Eisen was referred to Menon et al, "Position Statement: Definition of Traumatic Brain Injury" (2010) 91 Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1637, and acknowledged it to be a peer-reviewed authoritative publication. He acknowledged that altered brain function is signaled by an altered mental state at the time of an injury (e.g., with confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking), and it is considered part of the altered consciousness used to establish a diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury. That study concluded that a diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury should be considered when these symptoms are reported even if any more objective criteria - e.g., LOC (loss of consciousness), PTA (posttraumatic amnesia), or other neurologic deficits - are absent.
222  Dr. Eisen also confirmed that disorientation is part of the altered state of consciousness, and it is a positive indication of brain injury. He also confirmed that persons with head injuries are not reliable reporters of historical events.
223  Dr. Eisen was referred to Sterr et al, "Are mild head injuries as mild as we think? Neurobehavioral concomitants of chronic post-concussion syndrome" (2006) 6 BMC Neurology 7, and he confirmed to be a good authoritative journal. He agreed that mild static brain injuries typically induce a range of symptoms such as headaches, blurred vision, poor concentration, sleep disturbance, depressed mood or ability. He also confirmed that post-concussion syndrome can occur without a loss of consciousness; indeed, loss of contact or confusion is sufficient.
224  Dr. Eisen was also referred to P McCorory et al, "Consensus statement on concussion in the sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport held in Zurich, November 2012" (2013) 47 Br J Sport Med 250 with SCAT3, and he was satisfied that the British Journal of Sports Medicine was an authoritative publication. He accepts that loss of consciousness is not necessary to constitute a brain injury, and in some cases, signs may evolve over a number of minutes to hours. He accepts that although cognitive symptoms typically improve, symptoms may be prolonged. He said that "brownout" may be sufficient to indicate a brain injury - e.g., someone could speak to a person but not understand what was happening about them - and being woozy or dazed can also be a feature of a head injury.
225  Dr. Eisen agreed that concussed individuals will normally recover within seven to 10 days, but symptoms can be prolonged. He believes that after two to three months, patients begin to worry about their eventual recovery from the symptoms. He recognizes that sleep and cognitive impairment are important symptoms of people with head injuries. Difficulties with concentration and multitasking are evidence of changes in cognitive function of head injured patients.
3. After the accidents, did the plaintiff suffer symptoms from metabolic syndrome unrelated to the accidents or did he suffer a mild traumatic brain injury caused by the first defendant?
226  I conclude that Mr. Gillespie's brain was injured due to his impact with the front windshield during the first accident and that his symptoms are ongoing.
227  In making this decision, I have relied on Dr. Levis's opinion to a very limited extent and more so on Dr. Eisen's comments regarding the scholarly literature relating to diagnosing concussion syndrome.
228  Clearly, on the facts, Mr. Gillespie's head forcefully hit against the windshield, shattering the glass.
229  The generally accepted medical opinion consistently confirms that a diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury requires evidence of an altered state of consciousness soon after the event in which the injury is sustained. I am mindful that the experts disagree on whether Mr. Gillespie suffered a mild traumatic head injury with ongoing concussion symptoms. However, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, loss of concentration and memory, and noise sensitivity are all indicative of post-concussion syndrome. Confusion, disorientation, and slowed thinking are considered part of the altered consciousness used to establish a diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury.
230  I am mindful that a plaintiff's ability to accurately recall and express post-accident experiences can be hampered by the very injury that is to be assessed. Even the defendants' expert noted that individuals with head injuries are not reliable reporters of historical events. He may have been somewhat unreliable in his testimony; I ascribe that unreliability to the nature of his injury and not to any willful attempt to mislead the Court. I have been able to find the facts necessary to decide this issue in spite of the flaws in Mr. Gillespie's evidence.
231  There is always a difficulty in rejecting the connection between an injury and subsequent symptoms based solely on the temporal connection between them. In this case, I am satisfied that the temporal connection is not the only evidence connecting Mr. Gillespie's blow to the head and ongoing cognitive difficulties he described as affecting his work in day-to-day life.
232  I accept that, in spite of his memory difficulties, Mr. Gillespie was accurate when he said he" felt woozy" after the accident. He did not report pain at that time and was a very poor historian about the events at the scene and afterwards. However, I accept his wife's evidence that when she saw him at the hospital he was waiting to be treated, he had a bandage on the top of his head, and he appeared disoriented. She said he seemed to be in shock and did not make sense when speaking to her. He was normally an easy-going person but at the hospital seemed agitated, incoherent and erratic. She said he was unsteady on his feet.
233  She said Mr. Gillespie would start talking about the accident but his sentences were disjointed. She tried to get him back on track.
234  When they returned to their home, he continued to demonstrate erratic behavior. He did not seem to be able to follow through with any task he started, such as making himself a sandwich.
235  Where Mr. Gillespie was contradictory in his testimony regarding some of these events and symptoms, I ascribe his lack of consistency to the effects of his injuries. He was not a good historian and struggled to resolve inconsistencies with his previous evidence. I accept that he may have exaggerated his inability to perform his duties as effectively as before the accidents, but his evidence was generally convincing on the important aspects of his current function.
236  On the evidence I accept that Mr. Gillespie experienced and continues to experience some of the accepted indicators of post-concussion syndrome and mild traumatic brain injury. Indeed, the concussion clinic treated him as a person who was experiencing those symptoms, and Mr. Gillespie is still following their initial advice. This point would be more forceful if he had returned to the clinic for the suggested second visit and someone from the clinic had testified at the trial. But for the December 2009 collision, I find Mr. Gillespie would not have experienced or continued to experience cognitive impairment, continuing headaches, personality change, sleep disturbance, memory dysfunction, impaired concentration and attention. These are the symptoms associated with post-concussion syndrome and a mild traumatic brain injury.
237  Therefore, I have concluded on the balance of probabilities that Mr. Gillespie suffered a mild traumatic head injury with ongoing concussion symptoms. He also suffered inner ear dysfunction that resulted in intermittent imbalance. Those symptoms resolved through a compensation mechanism involving the ear, the brain and his visual systems. He is at risk for further imbalance problems.
238  Mr. Gillespie also developed neck and low back pain that worsened in the immediate aftermath of the accident. The second accident exacerbated these symptoms although he recovered within 7 to 10 days. He also had leg and right ankle pain that resolved within a short time.
239  Mr. Gillespie does not have any other soft tissue or orthopedic injuries.
4. If the plaintiff suffered a mild traumatic brain injury that the defendant caused, what are the appropriate damages?
240  For the reasons that follow, the plaintiff's claims are allowed at the following:
<damage type = "non-pecuniary">$85,000</damage> for non-pecuniary damages;
<damage type = "past wage loss">$160,000</damage> for past income loss;
<damage type = "future wage loss">$140,000</damage> for loss of future income capacity;
<damage type = "future care">$2,500</damage> for cost of future care; and,
<damage type = "special">$918</damage> for special damages.
241  I will address each category in turn.
Non-Pecuniary Damages
242  Mr. Gillespie has experienced personality changes - including irritability, aggressiveness, agitation, and a shortened temper - and all these changes impact his ongoing business and social life. Mr. Gillespie also suffers from some sleep interruption, headaches and some limited anxiety that usually occurs for a short time in the early morning and does not appear to affect him during the day.
243  Mr. Gillespie injuries have also affected his personal and intimate relationship with his wife.
244  Mr. Gillespie worries about his work performance, but these worries do not appear to create the type of anxiety that stresses him in the morning.
245  Mr. Gillespie is slower at his work and believes he makes more mistakes due to his cognitive changes. Both Dr. Eisen and Dr. Levis agreed that he has cognitive impairment.
246  Regarding recreation, Mr. Gillespie has not returned to golf, but he has a new dog and walks regularly.
247  Mr. Gillespie's symptoms have persisted for more than four years, and I find that that he will likely not return to his pre-accident state of health.
248  Mr. Gillespie referred to various authorities that I have considered in this analysis: Drodge; Joel v. Paivarinta et al., ; Greaves v. Grace, ; Mackie v. Gruber,  aff'd in ; Phoutharath v. Moscrop, .
249  The defendants referred to Warren v. Morgan,  [Warren] in suggesting the plaintiff's claim for non-pecuniary damages should be <damage type = "other">$50,000</damage>.
250  Of these cases, the most helpful analysis is in Drodge.
251  In Drodge, the claimant suffered chronic headaches with mild cognitive impairments associated with memory and concentration problems. His intimate relationship with his wife and recreational activities were significantly restricted. He suffered chronic low back pain before the accident, but the accident increased its frequency and intensity. The plaintiff had claimed to have suffered a mild traumatic brain injury at the time of the collision; the Court rejected this contention because there was insufficient evidence to confirm that he had a reduced level of consciousness or mentation after the impact.
252  Although rejecting the claim of post traumatic brain injury, the Court accepted that the plaintiff had suffered chronic headaches and associated cognitive symptoms for four and a half years following the accident. Dardi J. accepted that the plaintiff suffered severe persistent headaches and mild impairment to his memory and concentration associated with headaches. He was described as having a "crumbling skull" and was awarded <damage type = "other">$85,000</damage>.
253  In Warren, the claimant was involved in two motor vehicle accidents resulting in soft tissue injuries to her back and a concussion. The first accident was a mere tap and the second caused more substantial damage. She claimed to have severe chronic pain, cognitive impairment and psychological issues. The Court found the plaintiff untruthful and rejected her submissions regarding the trajectory of recovery. The Court concluded that her reaction to the accident was disproportionate and rejected the possibility of ongoing concussion symptoms. The plaintiff was found to be completely recovered from her accident related injuries and awarded <damage type = "other">$50,000</damage>.
254  In my view, Mr. Gillespie's circumstances were closely accord with those of the plaintiff in Drodge. The details of the plaintiff's post-accident circumstances and ongoing symptoms are not similar to those referred to in Warren. Although Mr. Gillespie's evidence was punctuated with some inconsistencies, I do not reject his evidence regarding ongoing symptoms and complaints as was done in Warren.
255  Although the authorities cited by the plaintiff are helpful, they are only a general guideline. Each case requires an assessment of an individual's circumstances.
256  I accept that Mr. Gillespie has suffered from ongoing headaches since the accident and that there has been a significant impairment in his concentration and cognitive function caused by the injury to his head. He suffered soft tissue injuries to his neck and low back which were exacerbated by the second accident.
257  His headaches worsened within one week of the accident and shortly after he developed cognitive difficulties that affected his memory and mathematical functions associated with his work. His outward personality changed and he encountered problems with sleeping. He also developed anxiety and a change in mood which have affected his day-to-day life.
258  Mr. Gillespie pursued treatment at the concussion clinic and with a neuropsychiatric; regrettably he did not persist with treatment that might have been available from these health professionals. There was no claim that Mr. Gillespie failed to mitigate his damages and I have no evidence to suggest that his current circumstances would have been improved if he had grasped those opportunities.
259  Dr. Levis opined that Mr. Gillespie will continue to experience these symptoms of headache, irritability, anxiety, interrupted sleep and cognitive difficulties into the future. The evidence of neither doctor indicated these features of Mr. Gillespie's current condition would be permanent continuing into the future.
260  I also take into account that Mr. Gillespie has suffered in vestibular complaint and otolith dysfunction which is not currently symptomatic. The condition may become symptomatic in the future and if this should happen he will be restricted from commercial driving or working around heavy machinery.
261  I conclude that a fair and reasonable award reflecting the past and future reality of how Mr. Gillespie's life has been and will be affected due to the accident is <damage type = "non-pecuniary">$85,000</damage>.
Past Income Loss
262  I am satisfied that the plaintiff's capacity to earn income after the December 2009 accident was impaired because of the injuries he sustained in that collision.
263  I do not accept that the plaintiff suffered any impairment to his income earning capacity because of the January 2010 accident.
264  His past gross and net incomes were:
M Gillespie - December 31, 2007 $489,661 $62,938 
M Gillespie - December 31, 2008 $65,238 $48,747 
MG Flooring - April 30, 2009 $958,180 ($36,472) 
MG Flooring - April 30, 2010 $854,173 $143,529 
MG Flooring - April 30, 2011 $628,726 $77,726 
MG Flooring - April 30, 2012 <damage type = "other">$827,850</damage> <damage type = "other">$166,921</damage> 
MG Flooring April 30, 2013 <damage type = "other">$420,926</damage> <damage type = "other">$22,352</damage> 
265  For the assessment of income Mr. Gillespie might expect from his efforts, I have used the after tax profit of MG Flooring. This is the amount that accumulates in the company's retained earnings account. I expect it will be paid out as dividend income in due course.
266  The plaintiff testified to changes in his cognitive ability, his memory and his personality. He suggests that the combined effect of these symptoms limit his ability to earn the same level of income he would have earned but for the accident and resulting injuries.
267  In general, Mr. Gillespie said small jobs are taking him longer, in part, because he needed to repeat his estimate work to be comfortable that he had not made an error.
268  Mr. Gillespie said he believes he is working at half of his pre-accident pace. He currently works nine hour days, but I found it difficult to discern the full extent of the work he was not bidding on or capable of performing.
269  It is important to note that he "guessed" he was taking twice as long to perform his work before submitting quotes. Before the accident he could do three "takeoffs" (quotes) in a day but would do that work only once; now he repeats his work before submitting his quote. He said that before the accident he could quote a job within 2-3% of his projected profit level; now he is not as accurate and relies on his bookkeeper to keep track of the profit.
270  On the whole, Mr. Gillespie was unable to provide any details about projects he quoted on but failed to win the contracts. He said he erases those details from his computer when he fails to secure the work. Despite the fact that he is making a substantial income loss claim in this proceeding, Mr. Gillespie has unfortunately kept no records of the jobs he has turned down or avoided since the accident.
271  I will proceed through the various years from the date of the accident to the trial to assess how the accident impacted Mr. Gillespie's work.
272  Initially, Mr. Gillespie testified that he did very little work after the accident except for those projects that were already in the mix for the end of the year. However he later testified he could not recall how much work he performed after the accident.
273  In any event, it appears he did very few jobs until summer 2010.
274  In 2010, he took a two week holiday, and on returning, he was able to function well. He said the work eventually became more computer driven, and he found the stress of large jobs overwhelming. In cross-examination, however, he curiously could not remember taking any holidays in 2010.
275  The 2010 profit was <damage type = "other">$162,000</damage>, but some of his 2010 income was earned before the December 2009 accident.
276  In 2011, the first full year after the accident, Mr. Gillespie's net profit was <damage type = "other">$90,808</damage>.
277  The last job he turned down before trial was a 22,000 square foot flooring replacement job in August 2011. He said he found the job had too much detail, so it was too confusing for him.
278  Mr. Gillespie testified that the company's 2012 gross income was <damage type = "other">$827,850</damage>. This amount was up from <damage type = "other">$628,726</damage> in 2011 and down from <damage type = "other">$854,173</damage> in 2010. The 2013 gross income fell to <damage type = "other">$420,926</damage>.
279  In 2012, he was anxious and not feeling well, but in May 2012, he took 20 days off for vacation during which time the company did no business (he took an additional three weeks off in October 2012 and was generally cutting back his work).
280  After returning from his vacation, he felt his health was improved. He was then able to work full time and expend more effort at his work in 2012, but that effort resulted in a decrease of net profit for fiscal 2013 to only <damage type = "other">$22,352</damage>. This was down from fiscal 2012 income of <damage type = "other">$166,921</damage>. This decrease in profit by <damage type = "other">$100,000</damage>, is hard to reconcile with his evidence of better functioning but likely reflects, in part, the added holidays he took in fiscal 2013.
281  His 2013 gross revenue dropped to <damage type = "other">$420,926</damage>. Curiously, his gross profit for 2013 declined to <damage type = "other">$73,306</damage> (17% of gross sales) from <damage type = "other">$246,869</damage> (30% of gross sales) in 2012. His 2013 cost of goods sold was inordinately higher than 2012, and he did not explain this difference.
282  Although the 2013 sales were almost one half of 2012 sales, he testified that 2014 was a good year but no sales numbers were put into evidence. Since May 2013 he has increased his workload. His anxiety, headaches, and sleep disturbance remain at the same level as he has experienced over the last three years.
283  In 2014, Mr. Gillespie did one large job for the Salvation Army. He did not have to attend at this jobsite because he was out of town.
284  Mr. Gillespie's wife will retire in three years, and he would like to move back to the Okanagan with her. He believes that he needs between <damage type = "other">$700,000</damage> and <damage type = "other">$800,000</damage> to fund his retirement. As of 2013, his company's retained earnings were <damage type = "other">$329,000</damage>.
285  Mr. Gillespie still enjoys his work in the flooring business, and his business activity is more rewarding when his customers can accommodate his pace. In this case, the plaintiff has kept no records of the work that he might have obtained if he had been fit to investigate and prepare quotes. He did not tender any evidence from prospective customers, other than Mr. Pingot, detailing the larger jobs that could have been available to him but for his injuries.
286  The evidence is, in essence, Mr. Gillespie's personal assessment and an anecdotal discussion about the type of work he would have done or would have qualified to do if he had not been limited in his cognitive functioning and memory-loss qualities that were compromised by his injuries.
287  Mr. Gillespie bore the burden of proof in this claim. I am not satisfied that his evidence permits me to make any mathematical calculation of the quantum of his loss.
288  Mr. Gillespie's company earned revenues of <damage type = "other">$958,000</damage> and <damage type = "other">$854,000</damage> in 2009 2010. The company lost money in 2009 (during its first year of operations) because sales costs were <damage type = "other">$942,677</damage>. Net income for 2011 (the first full year after the accident) was almost one half of the income for 2010 and less than one half of the 2012 net income.
289  I accept that Mr. Gillespie's capacity to work was reduced during much of 2011, but his holidays that year were a factor in that reduction.
290  I am equally satisfied that his injuries did not significantly impact his ability to earn income in fiscal 2012.
291  I do not accept Mr. Gillespie's statement that he was working in the order of half-time or at half capacity between the date of the accident and the trial.
292  Indeed, his 2011 sales were 74% of his 2010 sales and 65% of 2009 sales. His 2012 post-accident income is substantially greater than his pre-accident income. After taking two extended holidays totaling some 40 days during fiscal 2013, sales of the business were almost one half of the sales for fiscal 2012. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that he has sustained a loss of his capacity overall to earn income from the date of this accident to the present.
293  I also keep in mind that this is an assessment and not a calculation.
294  The data regarding Mr. Gillespie's historical capacity to earn income from this business in his post-accident performance is uncertain. No evidence was given to inform the Court on his level of sales for fiscal 2014. There was no evidence of efforts by the plaintiff to make accommodations or changes that might have ameliorated the consequences of his injuries.
295  Based on all the evidence, I estimate that the impairment to Mr. Gillespie's ability to earn income before the trial is <damage type = "past wage loss">$160,000</damage>.
296  I recognize this award must be adjusted to reflect the principles in Hudniuk v. Warkentin,  [Hudniuk].
297  Pursuant to s. 98 of the Insurance (Vehicle) Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 231 (the "Act"), a plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for only his or her past net income loss and the Court must deduct the amounts prescribed by s. 98 of the Act from gross earnings lost: Hudniuk.
298  Nevertheless, as the income is paid out to Mr. Gillespie, it will likely be subject only to small business tax rates. He will personally pay the difference between his marginal rate of tax and what the company pays. The calculation of the tax impact on these earnings will be determined after the award has been assessed and in accordance with the Hudniak principle.
299  The parties have leave to address this issue once they have reviewed these reasons.
Loss of Future Earning Capacity
300  In this case, I am not satisfied that the historical performance of the business enables me to perform a mathematical calculation of future income stream with any degree of confidence; indeed, such a calculation would not reasonably measure what might have happened if the accident had not occurred. No evidence helps identify the economic longevity of a person in Mr. Gillespie's circumstances.
301  Counsel suggested I could consider negative and positive contingencies based on the data presented. I am satisfied that there is a real and substantial possibility that, but for the accident, Mr. Gillespie would have earned significantly more income than he is now able to earn confined by the limitations of the effects of his injuries.
302  I am satisfied that he was pursuing two objectives: he wanted to accumulate sufficient income to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and he wanted to embrace the optimum vacation opportunities that coincided with his wife's employment.
303  The plaintiff invites the Court to assume that he would have continued to work and earn income at the same levels that were open to him before the accident. The vicissitudes in evidence do not warrant such an assumption.
304  Mr. Gillespie's income from 2008 - 2009 were well below those incomes he achieved in 2010 and later. He offered no explanation for the differences and he did not address the differences in his businesses performance over those years.
305  Income projections depend on levels of commercial construction and renovation ongoing at any given time. No evidence assisted the Court in estimating or anticipating the future prospects in flooring from now until Mr. Gillespie's suggested retirement date.
306  In the end, I accept that Mr. Gillespie is less capable overall from earning income from other types of employment; that he would be less marketable or attractive as an employee; that there has been some restriction in his income earning opportunities and he overall is less valuable as a person capable of earning income in a competitive marketplace. His physical and mental resources have been compromised. Nonetheless, he retains the ability to earn income in his flooring business and the task is to assess the impact these injuries will have on his future performance. There will be some diminution in that performance.
307  In the end, I will assess his damages with the view to incorporating the principles in Brown as the plaintiff argued. I will also consider that some empirical evidence pointed to Mr. Gillespie's economic success achieved in fiscal 2010 to 2012.
308  In an effort to find a balance between these two principles, I have concluded that Mr. Gillespie's impaired earning capacity should be assessed at <damage type = "future wage loss">$140,000</damage>.
309  I observe that the cumulative sums awarded for past and future income losses, when added to his 2013 retained earnings will leave him with <damage type = "other">$653,000</damage> toward his "nest egg" for retirement.
310  He has been busy through 2014, and I expect he will shortly achieve the <damage type = "other">$800,000</damage> he targeted as the amount he wanted for his retirement and relocation to the Okanagan. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr. Gillespie would have worked beyond 2016 if the accident had not happened.
311  I conclude that he is likely to retire shortly after he achieves his financial goal, and he would have retired at the same time if the accident had not happened.
Costs of Future Care
312  The only amount Mr. Gillespie seeks to cover for future care costs is his requirements for ongoing extra strength Tylenol.
313  I am satisfied that he will likely require ongoing medication to deal with his headaches and that the amount claimed to compensate for his future care costs should be allowed at <damage type = "future care">$2,500</damage>.
Special Damages
314  I am equally satisfied that Mr. Gillespie has incurred modest expenses for extra strength Tylenol consumed to date as necessary to ameliorate the headaches that have plagued him since the accident.
315  I will allow <damage type = "special">$918</damage>.
Summary
316  In summary, damages are awarded as follows:
<damage type = "non-pecuniary">$85,000</damage> dollars for non-pecuniary damages;
<damage type = "past wage loss">$160,000</damage> for past income loss,
<damage type = "future wage loss">$140,000</damage> for loss of future income capacity,
<damage type = "future care">$2,500</damage> for cost of future care,
<damage type = "special">$918</damage> for special damages.
Costs
317  If the parties are unable to agree on costs, they may speak to the issue.

Action by Gregory for damages suffered in a motor vehicle accident. Liability for the accident was admitted by Penner. Gregory claimed to have suffered soft tissue injuries to the left side of her body, resulting in increased migraine headaches, reduced mobility of her left arm and hand, and a ruptured breast implant that has deformed her left breast. Gregory left her job in a grocery store as a result of the injury and commenced training to become a welder. She held one welding position then eventually gained employment as a driver. 

HELD: Action allowed.
 Gregory suffered soft tissue, whiplash-related injuries to her neck, left shoulder, arm and wrist in the accident, from which she was substantially recovered 12 months after the accident. The rupture of her left breast implant was caused by the accident, which caused considerable additional pain and discomfort associated with the injury to her left breast and the ongoing disfigurement. Gregory was awarded $65,000 non-pecuniary damages for the ruptured breast implant and $30,000 non-pecuniary damages for her soft tissue injuries. Gregory did not establish that her injuries resulted in a substantial possibility of a future event leading to an income loss. There was no award for loss of future income or future earning capacity. Gregory was awarded $8,400 for past wage loss. It was impossible to quantify the housekeeping services performed by Gregory's daughter. Gregory was awarded $6,383 for cost of future care for the replacement of her breast implant and $4,038 in special damages.

Reasons for Judgment
E.A. ARNOLD-BAILEY J.
1   Lisa Marie Gregory (the "plaintiff") is suing Dustin Patrick Penner (the "defendant") for personal injuries she claims to have sustained in a motor vehicle collision that occurred on September 11, 2006, on the Mary Hill Bypass in the City of Port Coquitlam, British Columbia (the "accident"). Liability for the accident is admitted on behalf of the defendant.
2  In the accident the rear of the plaintiff's vehicle was struck by the left front of the defendant's vehicle, and as a result of the impact the plaintiff claims to have sustained soft tissue injuries to the left side of her body, resulting in increased migraine headaches, reduced mobility of her left arm and hand, and a ruptured breast implant that has deformed her left breast.
3  As a result of these injuries the plaintiff seeks non-pecuniary damages for pain and suffering, an award for diminished capacity to earn income in the future, past wage loss, awards for loss of housekeeping ability, cost of future care, and special damages. After the accident, due to the injuries she sustained, the plaintiff claims that she was unable to maintain her former occupation as a meat packer, and then was unable to work as a welder upon retraining. She also claims to have been financially unable to have her deflated breast implant replaced. In relation to the latter she was unsuccessful in obtaining an advance from the defendant's insurer, the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia ("ICBC"), to facilitate the same: Gregory v. Penner, .
4  The defendant disputes the extent and duration of the injuries claimed by the plaintiff. The defendant's position is that the plaintiff indicated to a doctor on August 2, 2007, that she was recovered from the accident-related injuries so as to qualify for re-training as a welder. Counsel for the defendant submits that the evidence linking an increase in the number and severity of the plaintiff's migraine headaches to the accident is equivocal, and that causation has not been established in relation to the rupture of the plaintiff's left breast implant.
Issues to be Decided
5  The substantive issues to be decided in this case are:
Which of the injuries and symptoms the plaintiff claims to suffer from, since the date of the accident to the trial, are proven on a balance of probabilities to have been contributed to or caused by the defendant's negligence in the accident, as opposed to being pre-existing, unrelated, or not proven to exist.
What is the extent of the losses suffered by the plaintiff proven to arise from the accident and what is the appropriate quantum of damages in relation to those losses under the various heads of damages claimed, namely:
non-pecuniary loss;
loss of future income and future earning capacity;
past wage loss;
loss of housekeeping ability;
cost of future care; and
special damages.
To what extent, if any, has the plaintiff failed to mitigate the injuries and symptoms attributable to the accident by not following the prescribed treatment plan or engaging in activities not conducive to a full recovery.
The Trial
6  At the trial the plaintiff testified, as did Dr. Ross Horton, a plastic surgeon. Also called on behalf of the plaintiff was Mr. John Banks, a rehabilitation consultant with a specialty in vocational evaluation and work capacity assessment; Mr. Darren Benning, an economist and an expert in the past and future income loss; Ms. Marion Nihls, a physiotherapist and a specialist in musculoskeletal rehabilitation; Mr. Fred Chaloner, a long-time friend of the plaintiff; Ms. Irene Mayoh, the plaintiff's mother; and Ms. Chandra Mayoh, the plaintiff's daughter. After sustained efforts by counsel for the plaintiff and an adjournment of the trial for several weeks, the plaintiff was also able to call her family doctor, Dr. Cremona Ticea, who failed to attend in response to the first subpoena.
7  In response the defendant, Dustin Penner, testified; as did Mr. Leonard Solstad, an estimator employed by ICBC. Counsel for the defendant also presented the video disposition evidence of Dr. Karen Wardill.
Relevant Evidence and Findings
8  I have reviewed the evidence at trial in order to determine the issues I have identified. What follows is a summary of the relevant facts derived from the evidence and my findings as to the credibility and reliability of the testimony of each witness. I will conclude this section with my findings as to the nature and extent of the plaintiff's injuries that I find were caused by the accident.
Evidence called on behalf of the plaintiff
The Plaintiff, Lisa Marie Gregory
9  The plaintiff is a 44 year old separated mother of two: a 20 year old daughter (Chandra Mayoh, who testified); and a son, aged 11 years. On the date of the accident, September 11, 2006, the plaintiff was going to pick up her son up from school when she got caught in stop and go traffic on the Mary Hill Bypass and her vehicle, a leased white 2002 Impala, was struck from behind by a black Volkswagen vehicle, owned and driven by the defendant. She recalled feeling "a big jolt", but was not sure what had happened. She said she had difficulty undoing her seat belt. The plaintiff recalled being asked by a female police officer, who was attending another accident nearby, if she wanted an ambulance to be called, which she declined because she was anxious to collect her son from school. She was asked by the officer to move her car to the side, which she did. When she got out of her car she saw black marks on the rear of her vehicle. She saw that the front left signal light and the front bumper of the Volkswagen were damaged. After the police officer wrote up the report, the plaintiff continued on her way.
10  In terms of how she recalled the moment of the collision and how she felt immediately afterwards, the plaintiff said she remembered "a big jolt" in which her head was flung forward and that her chest was very sore afterwards. She said that her chest must have been hit as she was flung forward.
11  The plaintiff said that she was wearing her shoulder seat belt across her chest and lap, her head rest was properly adjusted, and, if the car had an air bag, it did not go off. Within a few minutes of the accident the plaintiff said she felt pain in her chest and the back of her neck. Right after the accident she considered herself to be in shock, a nervous wreck, very disoriented, and only thinking of picking up her son. She said that she reported the accident immediately to ICBC. Later that evening she experienced nausea, chest pain, and a very severe migraine for which she took Gravol and four Advil.
12  Upon waking up the next day the plaintiff said that her neck was stiff and sore, she had an excruciating migraine, her chest was sore, and her left arm felt "like almost I had to unfold it". She described tingling feelings in both hands and she found that her left wrist was hard to rotate, unlike her right one. She said that her chest, and specifically the area of her left breast, was very sore. She also noticed bruises on her inner left forearm in the area of her bicep. She described the pain as being a "9 out of 10". She said that she went from being very physically fit to feeling like she had been beaten up.
13  The plaintiff testified that prior to the accident she had not been in any motor vehicle accidents in the previous two years or undergone any surgeries except the breast augmentation surgery in Florida in 2005. She said that she had breast augmentation surgery at the age of 39 to improve her appearance and her self-esteem. She chose to have saline implants as she understood them to be the safest.
14  The day after the accident the plaintiff went to work at Hill's Foods, an organic meat, poultry and game processing and packing plant ("Hill's"), where she worked packing their products. Prior to the accident she had been working there for a year, full-time with some over-time, for $12 per hour plus benefits. She had a problem her first day back to work, when she was unable to lift a tray of chicken breasts and it collapsed to the floor. She said that lifting like this was something that she did many times every day at work. She recalled starting the day with a migraine and experiencing numbness and tingling in her hands and fingers, which she described as "the weirdest sensation". She said that when she rotated her left wrist it felt really stiff and it got stiffer throughout the day. The plaintiff recalls telling her supervisor that she was not feeling well and thinks that she left early. She also recalls experiencing nausea that day and taking more Advil and Gravol before going to bed early.
15  Several days after the accident the plaintiff found that her left arm was very stiff and sore, more towards the area of her left shoulder. When she went to get dressed she found it difficult to put clothes on if she had to raise her arms. The plaintiff described the tingling sensation in her hands to be accompanied by a burning sensation in the area of her left breast, and that at times she would feel like there was electricity going through her left breast.
16  Three weeks after the accident, the plaintiff recalled that she woke up with a stiff neck and a migraine, tingling in her hands, and experienced difficulty in rotating her left wrist and in moving her left shoulder while putting on her tops and bras. Upon getting out of the shower, she noticed that her left breast was quite a bit smaller than her right breast and she asked her daughter to take a look. The plaintiff also noticed that a lump was present in her left breast. She recalled sitting on her couch in excruciating pain and in tears, taking four to six Ibuprofen or Advil at a time. She became concerned that she had breast cancer. She described the pain she experienced in her left breast at this time as approaching the pain of child birth.
17  As a result, the plaintiff went to the Emergency Department at Eagle Ridge Hospital on October 4, 2006. She said that she waited until then because as a single mother with two children she felt that it was imperative that she continue working.
18  The plaintiff indicated that she did work between September 12 and October 5, 2006, on "light duties", which she was initially able to manage, but after time she found that she could not perform the required light duties as the burning sensation in her breast, the pain in her left wrist, soreness in her left shoulder, and tingling in her fingers were still there. About a month after the accident the plaintiff said that she still could not drive as she could not shoulder check. She continued to experience a burning feeling in her chest all the time, and periodically she felt the electrical-like sensation.
19  The plaintiff went to her family doctor, Dr. Shehata, on October 5, 2006, and told her about the accident. She reported experiencing the worst migraines ever, pain and soreness in her neck, left shoulder and left wrist, and that her chest was hurting as a result of the accident. At this time, the plaintiff said she was having a lot of trouble getting dressed and was experiencing a lot of burning and pain in her chest. Dr. Shehata arranged for the plaintiff to have an ultra sound of her left breast on October 11, 2006, upon which the plaintiff learned that the saline implant in her left breast had ruptured and the lump was caused by fat necrosis.
20  The plaintiff was referred to Dr. Horton, a plastic surgeon, whom she saw on October 31, 2006. She learned from Dr. Horton that she would need to have surgery to replace the implant. He gave her a series of cortisone shots over several appointments to dissipate the fat necrosis in her left breast. The plaintiff found the injections very upsetting as she is scared of needles. However, she said that she was prepared to do anything to get rid of the lump, which was about an inch and a half in diameter. On one occasion, the needle broke in the course of Dr. Horton trying to inject the lump. She said that the treatments reduced the size of the lump but that the burning and electrical sensations in her left breast persisted.
21  The plaintiff understood that as of early 2007 she should have the left breast implant replaced, but said that she had not done so because she could not afford it. She was advised it would cost about $6,000. She said that she did not have the funds, nor was she able to borrow them. She said that the ICBC claims adjuster declined to provide her with the necessary funds because he took the position that the ruptured breast implant was not connected to the accident.
22  At the time of trial the plaintiff had not had the surgery to replace the ruptured left breast implant. She understood that the lump of necrotic fat was gone. She indicated that she was still experiencing the burning and electrical sensations in the area of her left breast on a sporadic basis throughout the day, every day. She said that when she had the lump the pain was a "9", whereas now it is a "7". She continues to take Ibuprofen and Advil. She remains concerned about the presence of a foreign object in her left breast and worries about cancer, as she previously had cervical cancer. She indicated that she is able to have the surgery when she can pay for it as long as Dr. Horton is available, and that it will take about two weeks for her to recover. She is worried that because of scar tissue in her left breast she may not be able to have a size "D" cup again when she gets the left implant replaced and, if that is the case, then she will have to have the size of her right breast implant reduced. At present, to create the appearance of breasts of equal size the plaintiff wears an artificial rubber breast inside the left side of her bra.
23  From October 5, 2006, until just prior to trial, the plaintiff continued to see physicians to help her recover, in terms of diagnosing the extent of her injuries and recommending treatment, including physiotherapy. Initially, she saw Dr. Shehata, and then switched to the Kensington Clinic where she primarily saw Dr. Ticea, and on other occasions saw other doctors, including Dr. Wardill, who testified by video deposition on behalf of the defendant. Between October 2006 and April 2007, the doctors provided the plaintiff with a series of notes regarding her employment, initially recommending her for light duties, and then explaining absences of varying length due to accident-related complaints.
24  The plaintiff testified that this ongoing injury has affected her life considerably. She will not date and has found that she is less outgoing and sociable, which has caused her relationship with her children to deteriorate somewhat. She likes to express her love for her children with physical gestures and finds this is hampered by her injuries and the on-going pain and discomfort. She also finds that since the accident she has started to experience panic attacks that happen quite frequently and "out of the blue", in which her heart races, her hands shake, and she cannot control her breathing. Also, about a year after the accident the plaintiff said that she became "very gloomy". On January 19, 2007, Dr. Ticea recommended that the plaintiff see a psychologist. The plaintiff advised that she was unable to see a psychologist due to the cost. She was also assessed by a psychiatrist upon referral from a doctor at the clinic.
25  The plaintiff obtained an initial referral for physiotherapy from Dr. Shehata, which was followed up by subsequent referrals from Dr. Ticea. The plaintiff underwent physiotherapy with Ms. Marion Nihls. She attended a number of appointments before taking a more intensive program of active rehabilitation, which ended in March 2007. The plaintiff considered that for about six months afterwards she slowly came to have greater movement in her neck and left wrist.
26  With regards to her neck, the plaintiff says she still experiences pain and stiffness. She still experiences pain in her left shoulder and has problems with the rotation in her left wrist. When she gets up in the morning she regularly has a migraine. She sleeps with two pillows under her head and shoulders as she learned in the active rehabilitation program. She continues to do the exercises she learned in that program to strengthen her neck, her left arm and wrist, and her core. She does stretching exercises for 10 to 15 minutes in the morning, and found on the day she testified that her neck was "not too bad", as she could bend it quite well to the right, but was more limited to the left, and could only rotate it about 25 degrees from straight ahead.
27  Prior to the accident, the plaintiff testified that she was very physically active and in excellent shape. She rode her bike and liked to wrestle and play physically with her children. She was a serious recreational swimmer, having been a competitive swimmer when she was young. She also played tennis, hiked, played co-ed baseball and taught swimming. As a young woman, she indicated that she had set national records for the butterfly and breast strokes, and had held the 100 meter national record in the butterfly stroke for the 30 to 35 year old age group. She was also a long distance runner at 12 years old and held a record for running the mile. She had then cross-trained between running and swimming to build up her endurance.
28  Since the accident the plaintiff testified that she cannot run as the movement causes her left breast to hurt, so now she walks quickly and wears a sports bra to reduce movement of her left breast. She said that she has not returned to swimming recreationally since the accident. She stated that when she goes to the pool she has a cappuccino while watching her son swim. She says that her neck is always sore and to exercise she takes Ibuprofen so as not to "end up as big as a house".
29  In terms of the plaintiff's ability to lift things, she said that in the first month after the accident she was unable to lift things like she had previously, as indicated with the collapse of the tray of chicken at Hill's. She said her employment at Hill's involved being on her feet all day, moving and lifting meat and poultry products on racks and trays. Initially, when she was on light duties in October 2006, she was able to perform the required tasks, but then as her left breast became more sore and the fat necrosis accumulated her chest became very painful, the pain in her neck affected her arm, and she found the pain to be more severe in the rotator cuff of her left shoulder. When she was no longer able to work she was on medical unemployment and then regular employment insurance.
30  In the spring of 2007, the plaintiff took an active rehabilitation program recommended by her doctor and supported by ICBC. This consisted of a "full-time" rehabilitation program for four days a week, for a period of four to six weeks. She said that her breast pain was not diminished by this program, but found that it was a great help in terms of increasing her mobility and reducing the pain in the area of her neck, left shoulder, arm and wrist, and in increasing her mobility. She found that it reduced her migraines. She considered that it reduced the pain in these areas from "a nine" to "a seven". It was recommended at the end of the program that she return to light duties at Hill's, but she had been laid off.
31  The plaintiff explained that prior to the accident she had wanted to go to welding school at BCIT to become a qualified welder. The program took a year and she believed she was strong enough to do the work. She considered the rate of pay and employment opportunities to be desirable. In order to be approved for the welding course, the plaintiff required medical clearance. She testified that she considered herself not to be completely recovered, but well enough to go to welding school. She saw Dr. Wardill at the Kensington Clinic on August 2, 2007, to obtain the necessary medical approval to take the welding course, although the plaintiff disagrees that she ever said she was "fully recovered" from the accident. The plaintiff actually attended twice for this purpose as she saw Dr. Wardill again the next day to have the note permitting her to take the welding course reworded to make it more explicit.
32  The plaintiff started in the welding course in August 2007, having been involved in the preceding months arranging for Employment Insurance to pay for it. She indicated that the course started at 7 a.m. with several hours of classes and then the rest of the training was "hands on" until 1:30 p.m. During this time, she said that she was still experiencing the burning and electrical sensations in her left breast. She found that her left arm was sore and she missed some classes due to migraines. However, she testified that she continued because she thought she was going to have "a good career" as a welder that would be good for her family. In particular, the plaintiff found that the welding and lifting of cast iron to be heavy work. It took her a long time to pass a particular part of the course that involved lifting over her head and much bending of her neck. She said she had to take two to six Advil a day to manage the course.
33  The plaintiff completed the welding program in March 2008. Whereas in the beginning she was at the top of the class, she was one of the last three students to complete it. She said that she "staggered" at the end with her migraines really bothering her. When she considered how she felt in March 2008, as compared to March 2007, the plaintiff said that her migraines had increased and her left arm was bothering her more than it had.
34  In April 2008, the plaintiff found welding work at Vedder Steel at $15 per hour. She worked with structural steel, which was not her preference, but as she was just out of training she took the position. She was given a blue print and was to produce what was set out on it. She found that the first several days were not bad and she was getting her tasks done, with some assistance in terms of heavy lifting. However, she found that as she continued her left shoulder became more sore, her neck very tense, and her left wrist very stiff. The plaintiff worked for Vedder Steel for about a month until she quit on April 23, 2008. During that time she thought that she called in sick once.
35  The plaintiff then sought work at a pulp mill, where she worked for a month. She took a position running a "barker", which she understood would not be physically demanding. She found that the long periods of sitting aggravated her neck, and that the job entailed more physical work than she had appreciated, including the lifting of heavy chains. During this time, she experienced on-going soreness in her left shoulder and found that her left wrist was not strong. She continued to experience the burning and electrical sensations in her left breast, which she considered to be present all the time, but which she noticed sporadically. She recalled that she missed one or two days during the month that she worked at the pulp mill.
36  Then the plaintiff went to work for a construction company doing site clean-up for $15 per hour. Her duties entailed cleaning the inside of houses, emptying garbage, carrying wood to a pile, raking, and the tamping of sand with a machine. She found that the more she raked and did the heavier outside duties, the more her left shoulder and left wrist hurt. She experienced "quite a few" migraines and found that she was taking up to four Advil or Ibuprofen per day to manage the pain. In particular, she found that the pulling motion in raking aggravated her left shoulder and caused pain in her left breast by movement of the implant. Over the period of four months that she held this employment, the plaintiff said that she missed between two to four days. She left to seek other employment.
37  The plaintiff then found full-time employment with Transparent Glazing as a driver. She delivered prefabricated windows to job sites. This employment did not require any heavy lifting, although she found it difficult to look over her left shoulder. She remained working for Transparent Glass for ten months, until she was laid off in July 2009. During that time she missed about four days of work. The plaintiff said that this work involved a variety of tasks that permitted her to change positions often.
38  In terms of her employment aspirations, the plaintiff said that before the accident her career goal was to be a welder, and while she obtained her level C, she had hoped to get her level B and work making kitchen equipment. Since the accident she said her goals have changed and she now thinks she would like to take a course at Douglas College to qualify to teach sports to children, particularly aboriginal children. She said that she had high hopes for her recovery after the active rehabilitation program, but she has had to switch gears because of the ongoing pain in her neck, left shoulder and the stiffness in her left wrist.
39  The plaintiff testified at some length about her other concerns regarding being able to provide for her children as a single parent and pay for basic living expenses. She said that her relationship with her children is diminished by the financial stress she is experiencing. She said she is short money for rent all the time and cannot remember when she last had a fridge full of food.
40  Prior to the accident the plaintiff testified that she did all her own housekeeping chores, which included vacuuming, washing windows, cleaning bathrooms, doing laundry and washing floors. She had also worked cleaning at a townhouse complex for $17 per hour. She liked to move her furniture around to vacuum. Since the accident, the plaintiff said she does some housekeeping chores but her children help more. Right after the accident her daughter did the vacuuming for several months. Now the plaintiff finds the vacuum heavy and does not move the furniture. Her son sweeps the floors and her daughter washes them. At present she says she can do housekeeping chores, but it takes her longer than it did prior to the accident.
41  The plaintiff described a long history of migraine headaches that pre-dated the accident but she claims that since the accident her migraine headaches increased in frequency and severity. While living in Florida prior to 2005, she said she sought medical attention for migraines once every three months and that she had also attended the hospital emergency department a couple of times. The plaintiff testified that prior to the accident she might have a really bad migraine such that she went to the hospital emergency department for an injection once every three months. In addition, once every six months she would have a less severe one that she could treat by staying at home and taking prescribed medication. She recalled during one week in December 2006 she had to attend the hospital emergency room three times.
42  Since the accident, the plaintiff testified that she experiences a really severe migraine once a week and she often has to attend the emergency department. She said the longest a migraine lasts is two days and her symptoms post-accident are much more severe. She has intense pain all over her head, her eyes are very sensitive to light, and her vomiting is much worse, extending at times for more than 24 hours. A less severe migraine lasts a few hours. The plaintiff said she wakes up with tension in her neck every day and has less severe migraines a couple of times a week. She stated she does not get headaches, as to her a headache is a migraine. She said that her family doctor, Dr. Ticea, prescribed her a medication called Imitrex for headaches, which is very expensive. After the accident, she was referred to a specialist for her headaches, Dr. Bozak, a neurologist, who prescribed medication called Topamax and referred her to specialized acupuncture treatments.
43  The plaintiff said she is puzzled as to why in the last four months she has found her left shoulder to be significantly worse. She finds that the pain has become excruciating when she tries to reach overhead, or to undo her bra. She testified that she wakes up every day with migraines, has pain down her neck into her left shoulder and finds that her mobility in her left wrist is reduced by stiffness. She says she is still experiencing the electrical and burning sensations in her left breast. The plaintiff said she now feels like she has gone back to "square one" and that the pain seems to come from nowhere and catch her off guard.
44  At the time of trial, the plaintiff said she experiences about two good days a week when she is able to wake up in the morning and do her stretching exercises and not take pain medications. On the bad days she wakes up with tension in her neck, her left arm feels sore such that she has to "unfold it". She has to take two Advil or Ibuprofen to do her neck exercises. She has a migraine that she would rate as a three or four in terms of the level of discomfort. The pain in her left shoulder does not subside and she experiences the burning and electrical sensations in her left breast. She often goes for a walk with the hope that fresh air will help. The plaintiff says she has three or four bad days a week and some days are a combination of good and bad. Overall she is taking four to six Advil a day to manage her discomfort. For her migraine headaches since the accident she takes Topamax, and a nasal spray. She said she would take Imitrex as prescribed if she was able to afford it.
45  In cross-examination, the plaintiff was questioned about the accident itself. She agreed the traffic had just started to move forward when her vehicle was hit from behind. She said she was looking ahead and did not anticipate the accident. The plaintiff said she felt a jolt and that she is not certain exactly what happened because she was disoriented. When pressed about this later in cross-examination, the plaintiff said she recalled a jolt and being flung forward, and that she believed she hit the steering wheel, but she could not say for sure. She put her car in park, got out without assistance and remained conscious. She recalls looking at the black marks on the rear of her vehicle, which she said did not appear to be accurately shown on the photographs taken later. At the time of the accident, she did not speak to the defendant, but recalls the defendant saying that it did not look too bad. When it was put to the plaintiff that she did not go to a hospital emergency or a walk-in clinic right after the accident because she had no symptoms she vigorously denied that was so, stressing that her only concern was getting to school to pick up her son.
46  The plaintiff admitted that she had panic attacks and experienced depression before the accident. She agreed she had taken Adivan in 2006. At one time she also started taking a medication for depression, Effexor, but was not sure how long she took it.
47  In terms of stress the plaintiff agreed that in 2005 and 2006 her son was experiencing learning disabilities, which had not been diagnosed as anxiety-related at the time. She was worried about him and took him for treatment and to appointments. She agreed that her son's lack of well-being causes her stress, but said he is better now. She agreed her son had a serious incident at school after the accident that she had to deal with. Her spouse's lack of involvement with the children has also caused problems, since her separation in early 2005. She agreed that her lay off from Transparent Glazing was due to a combination of shortage of work and issues related to her son.
48  The plaintiff confirmed that she found the active rehabilitation program to be helpful and agreed that she talked to the physiotherapist, Ms. Nihls, about how she was feeling. However, she denied ever telling Ms. Nihls that she was virtually pain free. Once the program finished she said she would have been able to go back to Hill's on light duties, but as there was no position for her, she applied for Employment Insurance. She said that since the active rehabilitation program ended in April 2007 she has continued with the stretches and other exercises at home and has gone to physiotherapy. She also said that at the end of the program she did go into the pool and did kicking. She said she could not do the butterfly stroke, but admitted she could get a workout by swimming. She also resumed hiking and went to the gym to exercise and do active physiotherapy until her 30 day pass ran out. She can lift weights but not as heavy as before the accident and she cannot use some of the machines as she did before. She also confirmed that she drove for the first month after the accident and then found it difficult and uncomfortable to do so, at which time her daughter took over taking her son to school and driving to the grocery store. However, the plaintiff then resumed driving.
49  The plaintiff agreed that she saw Dr. Wardill in August 2007 because Dr. Ticea was not available. She needed a note for the welding program to confirm that she was well enough to take the course. However, the plaintiff denies telling Dr. Wardill that she was completely recovered. When she was shown the note from Dr. Wardill dated August 2, 2007, she recalled that she had gone back to Dr. Wardill a day later to get a further note that specified she was physically able to do the duties of a welder.
50  She agreed that several weeks later she injured her right shoulder while playing with her son on the monkey bars for which she also saw her doctor. She was prescribed pain medication including Selebrex, Tylenol 3, and Naproxen and was then referred to physiotherapy for her right shoulder.
51  In terms of getting her left breast implant replaced, the plaintiff indicated that she did contact the plastic surgeon in Florida who performed the surgery, and she understood that for Mentor implants a person has to buy a warranty with the implants. The warranty only covers the cost of the replacement implant itself. The surgeon suggested to her that she have her surgery done in British Columbia because of all the associated costs. She agreed that she had not looked into the costs of accommodations and flights to Florida to have the replacement surgery performed there.
Dr. Ross Horton, plastic surgeon
52  Dr. Horton, a physician with specialty in plastic and reconstructive surgery, first saw the plaintiff on October 31, 2006, and then on four further occasions prior to trial.
53  According to his report, dated March 6, 2008, Dr. Horton noted the following upon his first examination of the plaintiff's left breast on October 31, 2006:
On examination in the office, she was found to have a D cup size breast on the right side. The breast was soft and non-tender. There was a well-healed periareolar scar. The implant was palpable and had a capsular contracture of a Baker II/IV level. Examination of the left side revealed that there is an obvious asymmetry with a lack of superior fullness. The implant was not palpable. There was a retraction of the areola with muscle contraction. There was a well-healed periareolar scar. There was a 4 centimeter area just superior to the areola which was very tender and an obvious palpable mass within the breast tissue.
It is my impression in seeing her that she had a ruptured saline implant on the left side. As well as fat necrosis on the left side due to a blow to the left breast. [sic] I arranged for her to have a mammogram. This was done on November 17, 2006, which revealed, "collapsed left subgladular saline implant. Fat necrosis with cluster of adjacent dystrophic calcification at 12 o'clock. Follow up left breast mammogram is suggested in six months to reassess the calcification and fatty necrosis." This mammogram correlated with the ultra sound done on October 11, 2006, which suggested of a traumatic implant rupture. The mammogram also confirmed the clinical impression of the fat necrosis.
54  Dr. Horton came to the following conclusion in his report:
In conclusion this patient has had a blow to the left chest secondary to a motor vehicle accident which has resulted in force significant enough to rupture the saline implant and to cause some fat necrosis to the left breast. Although the fat necrosis has improved, she has been left with a ruptured implant. This will leave her with a permanent disability with breast asymmetry. At some point in time she should have the ruptured implant removed and replaced with a new intact implant. This may be complicated somewhat due to the additional scarring to the left breast subsequent to the injury. I would expect that when she does undergo the correction of the left breast deformity, she will require a general anaesthetic done under a daycare procedure and will require 2-3 weeks recovery for this. Despite the corrective surgery she may still have some permanent residual asymmetry of the breasts.
55  In an update to his report dated September 22, 2008, Dr. Horton stated the following:
She had an MRI done on November 17, 2006, which revealed a collapsed left subglandular saline implant as well as fat necrosis adjacent to the implant. While there are many causes of implant rupture, trauma to the chest is certainly known to be one of these. The fat necrosis on the MRI suggests that there was significant left breast trauma. Since I did not examine her before her accident I can only assume she had an intact implant before the accident.
[...]
Removal of the implant and examination of the implant may or may not collaborate the trauma.
56  In his direct examination, Dr. Horton explained that with age natural breasts sag and there is a lack of projection in the upper half of the breast. Implants restore the breasts. According to Dr. Horton, an experienced plastic surgeon is able to distinguish between an implant and a natural breast.
57  A saline breast implant involves implanting a silicone bag with a small valve into which the physician injects the saline to create volume, the saline being the same as used for intravenous fluids. If the implant leaks saline, the body absorbs it.
58  Dr. Horton also explained that the fat necrosis he observed on the left side of the plaintiff's chest is "fat death" that occurs as a result of a tissue injury in which some of the cells die. He said that fat necrosis is associated with trauma and that it is commonly seen in thighs or buttocks.
59  Dr. Horton's interpretation of the plaintiff's mammogram results were that they revealed a sub-glandular collapsed implant, which means a ruptured breast implant that has shrunken down because of compression forces. He indicated that when he first examined the plaintiff's left breast he observed the lack of fullness and found that he could not palpate the implant. He said that the fact that he noted she had a mass near the left areola meant that she had experienced enough trauma to rupture the implant and to have the fat die, thus forming a four centimetre lump of scar tissue.
60  Dr. Horton then explained the procedure, involving a series of injections, which he used to try to reduce the size of the lump of necrotic scar tissue in the plaintiff's left breast. He indicated that without the injections to soften the lump it would tend to calcify and then would have to be cut out. Generally, he said that he would not want to make an incision on the upper part of the plaintiff's left breast as large as a golf ball to remove the lump, which is how he referred to the initial size of the lump. Thus, he set about to reduce its size so that by February 28, 2007, with the injections, he considered she had improved to the point that the implant could be replaced. In terms of timing of the replacement surgery, Dr. Horton said that an earlier time is better, but he declined to say optimal.
61  In terms of the outcome of the replacement surgery, Dr. Horton indicated that residual asymmetry could occur as the scar tissue remaining in the plaintiff's left breast would probably have to be cut out with the insertion of the new implant, and this could affect healing such that the breast size with the new implant may not be exactly the same.
62  On cross-examination Dr. Horton agreed that there were all kinds of circumstances in which implants may rupture, including by spontaneous leaking due to a faulty product or improper surgical procedures. He indicated that he was familiar with the Mentor type of implants used by the plaintiff and had used them in the past, although he now preferred a different brand. With regards to Mentor products, Dr. Horton indicated that the spontaneous leak rate is between one and five percent, and that would have been the rate prior to May 2005, when the plaintiff had her augmentation surgery. In the present case, Dr. Horton said that he does not know where the source of the leak is and upon removal the implant is sent back to the manufacturer. He assumes that a Mentor implant has a warranty and if the implant is defective the manufacturer provides a new implant. He said usually in such circumstances the original surgeon will do the replacement surgery without charge.
63  When asked about his conclusion in this case that the force of the accident ruptured the implant, Dr. Horton agreed that was an assumption on his part, although he said he had seen many patients who had been in traffic accidents. Key to his finding that the plaintiff's left breast implant ruptured in the accident was the presence of the fat necrosis. He indicated without that, the deflation of the implant could have been spontaneous, but with the presence of the necrotic fat there was "a pretty good likelihood" the deflation was caused by trauma.
64  Dr. Horton agreed that without replacement the plaintiff has a permanent disability, and with replacement the plaintiff may also have a permanent disability, but the latter was difficult to determine at this point. He also agreed that it was not uncommon for non-augmented breasts to be asymmetrical, and that even when augmentation surgery goes as planned some asymmetry may occur.
65  Dr. Horton impressed the Court as a highly knowledgeable, professional, and honest witness. I accept all of his testimony without hesitation.
Dr. Cremona Ticea, the plaintiff's family physician
66  Dr. Ticea, a specialist in general family medicine, saw the plaintiff on a number of occasions through the Kensington Medical Clinic, including with regards to injuries related to the accident and other concerns. Interspersed between the appointments the plaintiff had with Dr. Ticea were appointments with other doctors in the clinic. Dr. Ticea indicated that she relied on entries to the plaintiff's chart made by the other doctors.
67  Initially, after the accident the plaintiff saw Dr. Shehata, and then she moved to the Kensington Clinic, where on November 1, 2006, she first saw Dr. Symon.
68  In her testimony, Dr. Ticea reviewed the various appointments she had with the plaintiff starting on November 7, 2006, when she noted that the plaintiff had seen Dr. Horton due the ruptured left breast implant and fat necrosis. She also noted that the plaintiff had been off work for a week and reviewed the medication the plaintiff was taking for pain: Toradol and Tylenol. The plaintiff indicated to her that the pain her left arm and left breast was constant. The plaintiff's range of motion in her neck was full but she had pain on the right side with all motions. Her range of motion in her shoulders was full. Dr. Ticea's assessment was that the plaintiff was suffering from a ruptured breast implant and whiplash associated disorder. The plaintiff was to transfer her medical records, attend physiotherapy and come back in a week.
69  When Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff on November 21, 2006, she diagnosed left arm strain and the ruptured left breast implant and recommended three weeks off work with continued physiotherapy. She provided a note indicating that the plaintiff was unable to work for medical reasons related to the accident from November 21 to December 15, 2006.
70  Dr. Ticea next saw the plaintiff on November 28, 2006, for follow up and to coordinate an appointment with Dr. Horton on December 1, 2006, for an evaluation of the ruptured implant. Dr. Ticea signed an Employment Insurance form for the plaintiff that applied until the end of January 2007. She recommended that the plaintiff have physiotherapy twice a week.
71  Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff on December 14, 2006, by which time she had seen Dr. Horton and had a steroid injection in the lump in her breast. When Dr. Ticea examined the plaintiff she noted that she had a reduced range of motion in her left wrist, which was stiff, that her left hand was weaker, and she had pain in her left shoulder joint. The plaintiff was advised to continue physiotherapy, she was to attend to have her left shoulder x-rayed, and if that was negative, she was to have nerve conduction studies done. In addition to the other medication she was taking she was to take Flexeril, a muscle relaxant, three times a day.
72  Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff on January 11, 2007, at which time she was still off work, unable to work with her left arm. She considered the plaintiff to be worse since she had last seen her, as her wrist was stiff and she had pain coming from her shoulder. The plaintiff advised that she had been in hospital for migraines, and had been given a head scan, which was normal. She had been given a nasal spray called Axert and a trial of Eletriptan, both migraine medications. She was on an antihypertensive medication for fluid retention from the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Dr. Ticea recommended physiotherapy and nerve conduction studies.
73  When Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff on January 19, 2007, she noted three reasons for the visit: the first to do with the accident and the lump in the plaintiff's left breast that required another steroid injection by Dr. Horton; the second to do with migraines; and the third regarding counselling for divorce and the accident. Dr. Ticea said that she did not treat the plaintiff for depression, but noted that Dr. Wardill had referred her to Dr. Rana, a psychiatrist who works out of their clinic.
74  On February 5, 2007, Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff because she needed a note for work. She reported feeling similar pain in the left side of her neck, left arm and spoke of changing work. Dr. Ticea recommended that the plaintiff not work until February 28, 2007, when she was next scheduled to see Dr. Horton.
75  On February 8, 2007, the plaintiff attended to see Dr. Ticea to obtain a prescription for active rehabilitation which was to be approved by ICBC.
76  On March 8, 2007, Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff for an assessment prior to her starting active rehabilitation. The plaintiff advised that she was having two to three migraines per month, and that she was taking a migraine medication, Relpax. The plaintiff reported that she had seen Dr. Horton the prior week and the breast lump was 'nice and soft' and that if ICBC paid, she was going to replace the saline implant. The nerve conduction studies were negative, having been conducted by a neurologist, Dr. Bozek. Dr. Ticea recommended a CT scan of the plaintiff's cervical spine.
77  On March 21, 2007, Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff, who had experienced a bad migraine for several days. The plaintiff had been to a hospital emergency department that day and given morphine and another migraine medication to try. She continued to be unable to work and Dr. Ticea provided her with a note that recommended she be off work until April 21, 2007. The plaintiff also complained of experiencing panic attacks, in relation to which Dr. Ticea recommended breathing exercises and Clinazapan, in addition to prescribing Ativan sublingually as needed.
78  Dr. Ticea examined the plaintiff on April 12, 2007, for the purpose of completing a report at the request of ICBC. By this time the plaintiff had substantially completed the active rehabilitation program and it was suggested that she was ready to return to work on light duties. In the report, Dr. Ticea noted that the plaintiff's current complaints were that her left wrist was weak, and she was experiencing neck pain, migraines, left breast pain, and depression. Dr. Ticea listed the following as accident-related clinical diagnoses: left shoulder soft-tissue injuries, left wrist sprain, and ruptured left breast implant. She considered the plaintiff's upper back injuries at a Grade II in terms of severity (with Grade I indicating no physical signs and Grade IV indicating a fracture or dislocation) according to ICBC's categories on the report.
79  Dr. Ticea said that on April 12, 2007, when she completed the report, she was of the view that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff in the accident were having an impact on her ability to work full-time, as the plaintiff had advised her that she worked in a factory doing heavy lifting. Dr. Ticea recommended that the plaintiff try a gradual return to work but the plaintiff advised her that there were no light duties available at her previous employment.
80  On April 26, 2007, Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff in relation to migraines, and for a pelvic examination. She called the plaintiff back on May 2, 2007, to provide a prescription for a symptom unrelated to the accident, at which time the plaintiff advised that she had finished the active rehabilitation program and was doing the exercises at home.
81  On May 20, 2007, Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff in relation to migraines.
82  On July 20, 2007, Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff in relation to the injury to her right shoulder, in relation to which she had seen another physician on July 8, 2007. She was in considerable pain on July 20, 2007, and was having trouble managing the pain with Naproxen and was unable to take Tylenol 3. It was shortly after this that Dr. Ticea noted the plaintiff saw Dr. Wardill and sought the note saying she was completely recovered from the accident.
83  On August 16, 2007, Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff to review the x-ray of her right shoulder.
84  On August 24, 2007, Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff in relation to migraines and she reported that she had been seen in the Emergency Department the previous night. She was taking Topamax for migraines and would continue to do so. She was also taking Ativan sublingually, and Melatonin for insomnia.
85  On September 7, 2007, Dr. Ticea again saw the plaintiff, who complained of excruciating pain in her left shoulder related to the accident. Dr. Ticea noted that the plaintiff advised that Tylenol 3 helped.
86  The plaintiff then saw Dr. Ticea for four appointments unrelated to the injuries from the accident between September 19, 2007, and October 24, 2007.
87  Dr. Ticea last saw the plaintiff on December 4, 2007, in relation to continuing problems arising from the accident regarding her left breast and left wrist.
88  On January 8, 2008, Dr. Ticea saw the plaintiff for tendonitis in her right shoulder, for which she was to continue with physiotherapy and take Advil as needed. Dr. Ticea noted that the plaintiff had experienced the worst month of her life due to school problems. She was to continue to take Adivan and Topamax.
89  As Dr. Ticea had been away until recently, she examined the plaintiff on July 24, 2009, before testifying. Prior to that Dr. Ticea had not seen the plaintiff for a year. At the recent examination of the plaintiff Dr. Ticea advised that the plaintiff was still complaining of difficulties arising from the accident. Dr. Ticea noted that the plaintiff had a decreased range of motion in her neck and in her left shoulder and arm, as well as asymmetry in breast size, with her left breast being smaller than her right. She noted that the plaintiff's right shoulder was not bothering her.
Marion Nihls, physiotherapist
90  Ms. Nihls, a physiotherapist with a specialty in muscular skeletal rehabilitation, treated the plaintiff from November 22, 2006, to April 20, 2007. She described her treatment sessions with the plaintiff and reviewed the detailed notes she made of each visit.
91  During her initial assessment of the plaintiff on November 22, 2006, Ms. Nihls noted that the plaintiff's left breast was softer and lower than her right, and that she complained of pain in her left shoulder and upper arm, as well as numbness in both hands. The plaintiff described no prior injury to her neck and back but did report a long history of migraine headaches, including severe ones every three to six months that required her to attend a hospital emergency for treatment. During the physical examination of the plaintiff Ms. Nihls noted that there was a muscle spasm between her C 4 and C 6 vertebrae, some weakness between the fourth and fifth fingers on her left hand, and some stiffness and pain in T 4 to T 9 region of the thoracic spine.
92  Ms. Nihls saw the plaintiff again on November 24, 2006, at which time she complained of increased soreness and localized pain in the left anterior of her shoulder and down her arm. On November 29, 2006, the plaintiff advised that her shoulder had improved after the prior treatment. On November 30, 2006, the plaintiff cancelled her appointment because of a migraine headache. On December 5, 2006, she apparently called to advise that she was ceasing treatment until ICBC covered the cost because she could not afford to continue.
93  The plaintiff resumed physiotherapy on February 27, 2007, at which time she advised she was experiencing frequent migraines, right neck stiffness, pain in her left arm to her hand, and stiffness and trouble grasping with her left hand. She also advised of a burning sensation in her left breast and that the breast lump was less sore and softer after two injections from Dr. Horton. The plaintiff attended several sessions in early March 2007 before she commenced more frequent attendances as part of the active rehabilitation program that commenced March 8, 2007.
94  As the active rehabilitation program progressed Ms. Nihls noted improvement in relation to the plaintiff's neck, left shoulder and arm, and gradually in relation to her left wrist. Ms. Nihls noted in her interim report, dated April 5, 2007, that the plaintiff had improved in terms of her strength and level of functional activity. She was cleared for a graduated return to work as of April 18, 2007, but had been laid off, and was planning to go to BCIT in August.
95  The last time Ms. Nihls treated the plaintiff was April 20, 2007, at which time she noted that her cervical spine had improved but she continued to feel tightness on the right side at the base of the neck with left neck rotation. Ms. Nihls manipulated the T 5 area of the spine between the shoulder blades and the muscles on the right side of the neck. Thereafter, she was seen by another physiotherapist.
96  Ms. Nihls followed up with the plaintiff by calling her at home on May 29, 2007, which she reported upon in her letter to ICBC of the same date. In that letter Ms. Nihls notes "I spoke with Lisa today and she reported she is managing well and is virtually pain free".
John J. Banks, rehabilitation consultant
97  Mr. Banks is a rehabilitation consultant with a specialty in vocational evaluation and work capacity assessment. He conducted a work capacity assessment of the plaintiff on August 18, 2008. In his detailed report he assessed many different aspects of the plaintiff's physical ability to perform many tasks and activities related to her physical ability to work.
98  Mr. Banks had the following specific observations in his report regarding the plaintiff's ability to sit for periods of time:
Ms. Gregory demonstrated the ability to continuously sit for variable periods of time during the assessment, ranging from 33 minutes while involved in upper extremity static strength testing activities, to 2 hours during the intake interview. Ms. Gregory did not stand or stretch during the seated intake interview. No shifting of position was noted while seated however; Ms. Gregory reported increased neck and left wrist discomfort at the completion of 120 minutes of sustained sitting during the intake interview, and increased left wrist discomfort change was reported following 33 minutes of continuous sitting while participating in repetitive upper extremity tasks towards the end of the assessment day. Overall, Ms. Gregory's tolerance for brief duration and prolonged sitting was rated as functional, with increased left wrist discomfort noted with upper extremity use while seated.
99  In relation to the plaintiff's ability to reach overhead in terms of discomfort he noted the following:
Ms. Gregory demonstrated marginally functional tolerances for sustained overhead reaching while standing, with increased subjective neck discomfort reported while working for prolonged periods of time with her arms extended overhead while standing. Repetitive forward and overhead reaching activities were performed at a level of speed and efficiency consistent with competitive employment standards. She demonstrated functional unilateral hand dexterity, scoring within the above competitive employment standards using the left and right hands.
100  Mr. Banks did observe some weakness in the plaintiff's left hand that he noted as follows:
No weakness was noted in the right or left hands for grasping/holding during bilateral lifting and carrying activities in the range from 10-40 pounds however; biomechanical compensation was noted in the left hand when lifting and carrying in excess of this range. Functional isometric grip strength was measured in the MEDIUM strength range for the right and left hands. Isometric pinch strength was also measured in the MEDIUM strength range for both hands during key grip and 3-point pinch assessment, when compared to industrial standards.
101  Mr. Banks concluded as following about the plaintiff's overall physical condition:
From a vocational perspective, the results of the current assessment suggest Ms. Gregory has demonstrated sufficient body dexterity and limb coordination but has not demonstrated sufficient strength to tolerate all of the physical demands of her previous job as a meat packer (NOC# 9462.2: PA=V2, C0, H1, B2, L1, S4), including the related occupations of meat roll tier, meat portion cutter, poultry preparer, meat cutter, bench woman, meat trimmer and meat boner. These occupations are considered by the NOC to be HEAVY (S4) strength occupations, with work activities involving lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling and handling loads greater than 20 kg (44 pounds); a body dexterity requirement for standing and/or walking (B2) and; a requirement for upper limb coordination (L1). Specific limitations relate to a reduced tolerance for repetitively lifting at a HEAVY (S4) strength level, especially above shoulder height, with biomechanical breakdown noted when lifting and carrying weights in excess of 40 pounds. Similarly, Ms. Gregory has exhibited limitations on activities requiring pushing or weight bearing with the left wrist as measured during isometric testing on the ERGOS work simulator, as well as a reduced tolerance for pinching and gripping strength. This places her functional ability for pushing, pinching and gripping in the MEDIUM (S#) strength range, with limitations in functional frequency of loading the left wrist.
The results of assessment indicate that Ms. Gregory currently is able to perform her current job duties as a new construction cleaner (NOC# 6661: PA=V2, C0, H1, B4, L1, S3), including the related occupations of building cleaner, cleaner, cleaning woman light duty cleaner, residence cleaner and sweeper. These occupations are considered by the NOC to be MEDIUM (S3) strength occupations, with work activities involving lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling and handling loads from 10 kg (22 pounds) to 20 kg (44 pounds); a body dexterity requirement for sitting, standing and/or walking as well as other body positions such as stooping kneeling and crouching (B2) and; a requirement for upper limb coordination (L1).
Ms. Gregory's ability to perform in her current job duties is dependent on her ability to be able to change position during the work day. This has allowed her to tolerate her job duties especially with her limited ability to load the left wrist.
102  In his testimony, Mr. Banks reviewed the findings in his report. He focused on the plaintiff's weaknesses, which included that she could not maintain a functional lateral grasp with her left hand that forced her to use her wrist or ulna. He noted signs of neck strain with sitting beyond 120 minutes. He found the plaintiff had no limitations in terms of her use of her right hand, but in relation to her left hand within two minutes she would be compensating for limitations. According to Mr. Banks if there is a significant difference in a person's ability to pronate and supinate a hand it is indicative of a functional limitation. In the plaintiff's case the pronation of left hand was compromised and she experienced pain in her elbow and in a distribution down the side of her left hand.
103  On cross-examination, Mr. Banks indicated that in his report, when he states that the pronation and supination of her hand were good, that was without loading the hands. He agreed that he had not assessed the plaintiff prior to accident and that he did not know what her limitations were prior to it. He agreed that the National Occupational Classification ("NOC") definitions of the job requirements for a meat packer and a new construction cleaner were not job specific and so they may not apply to the job that the plaintiff was doing at Hill's. He confirmed that he terminated dynamic lifting because the plaintiff was showing weakness on her left side. In terms of his testing for the range of motion in both of the plaintiff's shoulders, Mr. Banks considered both shoulders were functional but he noted that if the plaintiff used her left shoulder there was mild recruitment of other muscles to help. In terms of neck flexion, Mr. Banks noted that while performing lateral flexion there was pulling on the right when bending to the left.
Darren Benning, economist
104  Mr. Benning, an economist, was qualified to provide expert opinion evidence in the area of past and future income loss. His report assumes that the plaintiff, absent the accident, would have completed the training necessary to work as a welder and thereafter would have pursued employment in that occupation through to an assumed retirement at no later than age 65 years. It also assumes that as a result of the accident the plaintiff would continue what was her current employment at Transparent Glazing, working 40 hours per week at a wage rate of $15.50 per hour. In the alternative, he assumed that the plaintiff will retain and seek employment as a child and youth care counsellor. Mr. Benning included various negative contingencies in his calculations including non-participation in the labour force, unemployment, working less than fulltime, and premature death. The plaintiff was 43 years old at the time he wrote his report.
105  Mr. Benning estimates future loss of employment income with the plaintiff continuing with employment at Transparent Glazing or a comparable employer as compared to working as a welder to be $323,481. In the event that she were to continue after the accident as a child and youth care counsellor as opposed to a welder, and assuming two years training in relation to the former, he estimates her future loss of employment income to be $341,089.
106  It is relevant to note that Mr. Benning reviewed the plaintiff's income: for 2003 and 2004 -- $1 per year; for 2005 -- $6,872 (of which $4,272 was reported as T4 Earnings and $2,600 was Other Employment Income); for 2006 -- $18,497 (primarily T4 Earnings); for 2007 -- $20,619 (all but $95 of which was from Employment Insurance benefits); and for 2008 -- $22,994 (of which $11,644 was reported as T4 Earnings, $7,238 was Other Employment Income, and $4,112 was from Employment Insurance benefits). Mr. Benning reviewed the plaintiff's recent employment at Vedder Steel from April 2 to April 23, 2008, her employment at Fraser Ridge Industries as a construction site cleaner between April 25 and May 14, 2008, followed by her employment at Transparent Glazing as a delivery driver, which commenced in September 2008. He reports that as of April 20, 2009, when he wrote his report, the plaintiff was on a leave of absence from Transparent Glazing to care for her son that was anticipated to last four to six weeks.
107  On cross-examination, Mr. Benning admitted that his calculations were based on a wage rate as a welder of $20 per hour, and to the extent she was earning $15 per hour at Vedder Steel he overestimated her past loss. He said that his census data was based on male welders as there is insufficient data available for female welders. He agreed that typically women do have lower career earnings influenced by time out for child rearing, less tenure and less experience, and the fact that men tend to work more hours per week than women even in the same type of employment. As there was no evidence that the plaintiff would get her trade certificate in welding he used data for all welders.
Chandra Mayoh, the plaintiff's daughter
108  Chandra Mayoh, the plaintiff's daughter ("Chandra"), is 20 years old. She is in her second year pursuing a Bachelor of Arts with a major in criminology. She lives with her mother and was aware of the accident. She recalled seeing her mother the day of the accident when she was complaining about pain in her neck and left shoulder and arm. She thought that her mother took a couple of days off work because her arm was hurting and then she went back to work. Chandra recalled that her mother found the pain in her left arm to be too much, so she applied for medical leave from work for a few months.
109  Chandra recalled that as her mother's pain worsened, she started to get migraines from the tension in her neck, and to experience sharp pain in her left breast. She described her mother asking her to look at the latter's left breast when she was naked. Chandra said that she saw that her mother's left breast had changed in size and that it was "now flat" and there was a significant size difference between her left and right breasts. She said that her mother is still bothered by this and that she still experiences pain and discomfort in both her left arm and left breast. She has seen her mother get a sharp pain and lean over and grab her arm. She said her mother has to rest and not use her arm. She understood her mother to take Tylenol and Aspirin and Topamax for her migraines and that she has lost track of the number of doctors her mother has attended. She confirmed that her mother had a very bad migraine after the prior day in court, and she had to take her to the hospital for a shot to stop her vomiting. She indicated that her mother started to take Topamax for migraines after the accident because she was getting migraines several times a week, whereas before the accident her mother was getting migraines once a month or once every couple of months.
110  Chandra said that she does not swim with her mother anymore as her mother cannot rotate her arm, and her mother does not "rough house" with her little brother because that hurts her arm. She said her mother has gained 15 pounds since she has stopped swimming.
111  Chandra indicated that prior to the accident her mother did the house cleaning but now she helps out by moving everything that has to be moved. Chandra said she helps because she is older and because her mother is in pain.
112  Chandra has also noticed that her mother is more stressed and less social since the accident. She says her mother goes out less with friends now and that she feels down. She recalled that after her rehabilitation program her mother's injuries got better but then they seemed to return.
113  On cross-examination, Chandra indicated that prior to the accident she was in high school and would keep her own room clean and do her dishes. She did not take her brother to school as she was in high school herself.
Irene Mayoh, the plaintiff's mother
114  Ms. Mayoh, a registered nurse with over 30 years' experience, testified in relation to her daughter, the plaintiff. Ms. Mayoh said that as a young woman the plaintiff was very physically active. She was a competitive swimmer, had many friends, and seemed to be a very happy person. Prior to the accident, Ms. Mayoh indicated that the plaintiff had no serious health problems except migraines, which she managed. To Ms. Mayoh her daughter seemed fine, busy with her children, doing her own house work that included washing walls and vacuuming, and shopping for and carrying the groceries for her family. She recalled that the plaintiff wore clothing in a size three or four, whereas since the accident she wears a size 10 to 12. She believes that the plaintiff has gained about 30 pounds since the accident. Ms. Mayoh recalled that at age 26 or 27 the plaintiff had surgery for cervical cancer.
115  Ms. Mayoh recalled that the plaintiff called her the day of the accident and that she saw her about two weeks afterwards. At that time, Ms. Mayoh recalled that the plaintiff complained of pain in her neck and down her left arm, and weakness in her left wrist. The plaintiff moved her head tentatively and complained of pain in her left shoulder and wrist when she lifted things.
116  Ms. Mayoh testified that she noticed that the plaintiff's injuries from the accident did not seem to improve. They appeared to be worsening and came to affect her mental state. She observed the plaintiff to become stressed out and increasingly worried about how she was going to provide for her children. The plaintiff continued to complain of pain at the back of her neck, down her left shoulder and into her left wrist. She also observed that the plaintiff still had trouble putting on her seat belt.
117  Ms. Mayoh indicated that she was aware that the plaintiff had breast augmentation surgery in 2005. She also knew of the plaintiff's problem with the left implant bursting "pretty quick right after the accident" after she had noticed it while taking a shower. Ms. Mayoh indicated that the plaintiff's left breast is really deformed as it resembles "a bag with nothing in it." She also indicated that she was not aware of her daughter having any problems with her breasts or any deformities in her breasts prior to the accident. Ms. Mayoh said that after the accident she helped the plaintiff as much as she could in terms of helping with her grandson and with household chores, including laundry, cleaning and cooking. She indicated that she does not do as much at present but that she still prepares dinner for the plaintiff and her family about twice a month. Ms. Mayoh said that she did not know the cost of repairing the plaintiff's left breast, and that her daughter had not asked her for money for that purpose.
118  On cross-examination Ms. Mayoh said that she had never gone with the plaintiff to a hospital emergency department for treatment for the latter's migraines, but she was aware that her daughter had done so. Ms. Mayoh said she was with the plaintiff in 2005 for a month when the latter had the breast implant surgery and changed the dressings for her. She confirmed that she had seen the plaintiff's bare breasts since the surgery and more recently since the accident.
Fred Chaloner, family friend
119  Mr. Chaloner is a long-time family friend of the plaintiff's. In particular, his recently-deceased wife was a very close friend to the plaintiff for almost 20 years, from the time the plaintiff had her first child. He said his wife used to babysit when the plaintiff's children were young and he would go over and help her with chores.
120  Mr. Chaloner said that he was aware that the plaintiff was in an accident in 2006 but said she never elaborated on the details. He said after 2006 she was fairly active in terms of swimming and other activities. He encouraged her to go into welding. He said she was enthusiastic about welding and did not need a lot of encouragement. He recalled that once she finished the welding course and got a job as a welder she would come over and complain that her back, shoulder and breasts were giving her trouble. She would take Tylenol and then go home. She indicated that the job at Vedder Steel was "just killing her". He noticed she had slowed down and was not as active as she had been. She seemed moodier, less upbeat, and quieter when she came over to visit. Whereas the plaintiff and his wife got along perfectly before the accident, he recalled that they had a few squabbles after it. He was aware that the plaintiff was not feeling well and that something had gone wrong with her breast. He also recalled that after she was working for the window business she would drop by to see him after work and ask for a Tylenol. She talked about having to quit that job. Mr. Chaloner's impression was that prior to the accident she was "a fireball". His view was that she was no longer that way and seemed to have slowed down a lot.
121  On cross-examination Mr. Chaloner agreed that while his wife had cancer and during the times when the plaintiff seemed moody, he was busy working, and thus, did not interfere. He recalled that the plaintiff would complain about her shoulder and her back and always talked about trying to get the money to pay for cortisone shots. He understood she had to leave her employment as her shoulder would not take it.
Evidence called on behalf of the defendant
Dustin Penner, the defendant
122  Mr. Penner testified that he was travelling east in his Volkswagen in stop and go traffic on the Mary Hill bypass between 2 and 4 p.m. on September 11, 2006, when he noticed an accident on the other side of the road. It distracted him and when he looked back it was too late for him to avoid a collision with the rear bumper of the plaintiff's vehicle directly in front of him. He estimated his speed to have been about 10 to 15 kilometres per hour when he slammed on his brakes as his vehicle stuck the plaintiff's vehicle. He recalled getting out and checking the damage, a police officer attending to take statements, and that he received a ticket for several infractions. He said that he did not talk to the driver of the other vehicle at the scene.
123  On cross-examination Mr. Penner admitted that he was in first gear and that 10 to 15 kilometres per hour was probably his minimum speed. He admitted that he had his foot off the clutch and had just begun to accelerate before he hit the brake. He admitted that he could have been travelling up to a speed of 25 kilometres per hour at that point.
Leonard Solstad, an estimator with ICBC
124  Mr. Solstad, an estimator with ICBC, examined the defendant's vehicle on November 7, 2006, and estimated the amount of damage and the costs of repair. Mr. Solstad considered the damage to the Volkswagen to be cosmetic damage to the left side and centre of the hood, which had buckled. The grille was broken and had already been replaced by the defendant. The left signal light was broken and there was some damage to the center and front of the left bumper. He estimated the cost of repair to be $1,069.76. He estimated that the cost of the grille repaired directly by the defendant to be from $36 upwards depending on the quality of the replacement part.
Dr. Karen Wardill, a physician in the same clinic as Dr. Ticea
125  Counsel for the defendant tendered the video deposition evidence of Dr. Wardill at trial. She testified that she saw the plaintiff on several occasions at the Kensington Clinic where Dr. Ticea also worked. Dr. Wardill recalled that she saw the plaintiff on August 2 and again on August 3, 2007, and then on a number of subsequent occasions.
126  On August 2, 2007, Dr. Wardill had a discussion with the plaintiff because she wanted a note saying she was fully recovered from the accident and able to return to work. Dr. Wardill provided the note. The next day she saw the plaintiff again when she provided a reworded note that specifically referred to the plaintiff as physically able to perform all the duties of a welder.
127  Dr. Wardill recalled that she also treated the plaintiff on several occasions later in August 2007 for an injury to the plaintiff's right shoulder (first treated in July 2007), for which she prescribed Tylenol 3. She again saw the plaintiff on November 11, 2007, for "chronic shoulder tendonitis" and again on July 25, 2008, for anxiety and panic attacks, as well as a complaint of stiffness in her left wrist. On October 18, 2008, she referred the plaintiff to a psychiatrist.
128  On cross-examination, Dr. Wardill agreed, based on the notes on her file, that she did not physically examine the plaintiff on August 2, 2007. Therefore, her notation referencing the plaintiff's return to work was based on what the plaintiff told her. She recalled that the purpose of the visit was for the plaintiff to obtain a note permitting her to return to work and the purpose of the visit the next day was to obtain a reworded note. Dr. Wardill indicated that she could not recall what kind of work the plaintiff was returning to.
Findings as to Reliability and Credibility
129  First, I will set out my findings in relation to the testimony of the plaintiff.
130  At trial the plaintiff did her best to be a reliable and credible witness. She presented as an unsophisticated, rather naive person who was generally truthful, at times against her own interest. It is clear that her life preceding the accident and since is very stressful for many reasons unrelated to the accident. However, the accident has added to her stress and her financial concerns as it interrupted and ultimately caused her to lose her employment at Hill's.
131  I accept that from the accident until September 2007, a period of 12 months, the plaintiff experienced considerable pain, discomfort, weakness, and limitations on movement in relation to the soft tissue injuries to her neck and left arm and shoulder as she described. This time frame recognizes the plaintiff's attendances on Dr. Wardill in early August 2007 and a further visit to Dr. Ticea on September 7, 2007, when she complained of pain and discomfort in relation to injuries sustained in the accident. It also takes into account a further period of time to recover after the plaintiff reported to Ms. Nihls on May 29, 2007, that she was "managing well" and was "virtually pain free".
132  I also accept that the plaintiff experienced considerable additional pain and discomfort associated with the injury to her left breast and the treatment of the necrotic fat, as well as the ongoing disfigurement. I do not doubt that for the plaintiff to continue to live with the ruptured left breast implant has added considerable stress and pain to an already complicated and difficult life.
133  However, I find that the plaintiff also was prone to exaggerate the severity and duration of some of her symptoms, including the level of pain and the degree of incapacity she experienced, particularly in relation to her migraines. If the migraines had truly approached the frequency and severity she described after the accident, she would have been unable to function at all. On the totality of the evidence I do not accept that injuries she sustained in the accident exacerbated her migraines to the extent she described, or that the migraines she experienced after September 2007 to the present are related to the accident.
134  I accept that the injury to her left breast, the trauma that produced the lump of necrotic far and the ruptured implant, was caused by the accident as I will explain later. I accept the plaintiff's evidence that the pain, the burning, tingling, and electrical sensations that she has experienced in her left breast, and the ongoing discomfort, worry, stress, humiliation and lack of self-confidence, due to trying to go about her daily life with a collapsed breast implant still in her chest are considerable.
135  I remain somewhat puzzled as to how it was that the Medical Services Plan was not called upon to cover the removal of the collapsed implant, or why the plaintiff was not able to borrow sufficient funds in the past three years to have the surgery to replace it, either from her mother, other family members, or even from her good family friend, Mr. Chaloner, in the event that she truly could not afford to pay for it herself. However, this matter was not canvassed in any detail before the Court, except that the plaintiff made it clear that she was of very limited means when it came to supporting herself and her children.
136  In terms of the plaintiff's testimony about her employment and aspiration to become a welder, I accept that she had the goal to become a welder, and was determined to take the training and try it. However, it is significant in my view that the plaintiff's planning to take the welding course commenced about six months prior to August 2007, which means that practically speaking she anticipated being able to take it as early as January 2007. This course was further training that she chose to do and it obviously required significant physical strength. It seems that she was prepared to undertake the course with a collapsed breast implant in her chest. She pursued funding to support her training and saw Dr. Wardill in early August 2007, not once but twice, to get the appropriately-worded note to indicate that she was recovered from the accident to the extent she could do the heavy physical work of a welder.
137  I do not accept based on her employment history prior to the accident, to the extent it was disclosed, or her conduct after she took the course and worked for less than a month as a welder at Vedder Steel, that she was committed to a long-term future career in welding, or indeed, in any particular occupation or employment. Her pre- and post-accident employment history as revealed by the evidence does not support any such inference. Three weeks on the job as a welder at Vedder Steel does not demonstrate commitment to a career in welding, particularly when the next job the plaintiff sought and obtained had nothing to do with welding.
138  The only reasonable inference to be drawn from her conduct is that, based on how she felt in August 2007 and after September 7, 2007, when she saw Dr. Ticea for accident-related pain, is that she was sufficiently recovered to undertake such training. This is so even after the injury to her right shoulder in July 2007 that required significant medication for pain and physiotherapy. I find that logically this must mean she was no longer suffering from the considerable ill effects she attributed to the accident, except in relation to her left breast, which she had decided to endure.
139  I further find that the plaintiff's evidence about an increased intensity and frequency of migraine headaches after the accident is unreliable, as is her evidence about the level of physical activity she was able to sustain, as shown in her contradictory testimony about being able to go swimming. I am of the view that her accident-related injuries were compounded by the considerable stress and worry in her life related to being able to care for and be the sole supporting parent of her children, particularly her young son. My impression is that these stresses, unrelated to the accident, compounded by the discomfort and worry caused by her ruptured breast implant and how she was going to manage its repair, had a significant impact on her being able to deal with the physical and mental stresses of the work place. I find they contributed to her exaggeration of the severity and frequency of her migraine headaches after the accident. To accept her evidence as to her migraine headaches after the accident would essentially mean that she was completely debilitated by them, which obviously she was not. I do, however, accept that the pain from her soft-tissue injuries and her ruptured implant caused some increase in the intensity and frequency of her migraine headaches from the date of the accident to September 2007.
140  I also accept the plaintiff's testimony regarding her observations in relation to her ruptured breast implant and the significant associated ongoing pain and discomfort in light of the corroborative and highly reliable, independent evidence of Dr. Horton, which I accept in its entirety.
141  In terms of the testimony of the other witnesses called on behalf of the plaintiff and the defendant I find that each testified in a reliable and credible manner, and I accept their evidence.
Findings and Analysis
Finding as to Causation Regarding the Breast Implant Rupture
142  The plaintiff submits that the evidence of the plaintiff and Dr. Horton establishes that a cause of the ruptured breast implant was the accident.
143  The defendant, on the other hand, submits that causation as between the accident and the plaintiff's ruptured breast implant has not been established.
144  The legal test for causation in civil cases was discussed by Major J. in Athey v. Leonati,  [Athey] at 466-467:
Causation is established where the plaintiff proves to the civil standard on a balance of probabilities that the defendant caused or contributed to the injury: Snell v. Farrell, ; McGhee v. National Coal Board, [1972] 3 All E.R. 1008 (H.L.).
The general, but not conclusive, test for causation is the "but for" test, which requires the plaintiff to show that the injury would not have occurred but for the negligence of the defendant: Horsley v. MacLaren, .
The "but for" test is unworkable in some circumstances, so the courts have recognized that causation is established where the defendant's negligence "materially contributed" to the occurrence of the injury: Myers v. Peel County Board of Education; , Bonnington Castings, Ltd. v. Wardlaw, [1956] 1 All E.R. 615 (H.L.); McGhee v. National Coal Board, supra. A contributing factor is material if it falls outside the de minimis range: Bonnington Castings, Ltd. v. Wardlaw, supra; see also R. v. Pinske  (B.C.C.A.), aff'd .
In Snell v. Farrell, supra, this Court recently confirmed that the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's tortious conduct caused or contributed to the plaintiff's injury. The causation test is not to be applied too rigidly. Causation need not be determined by scientific precision; as Lord Salmon stated in Alphacell Ltd. v. Woodward, [1972] 2 All E.R. 475, at p. 490, and as was quoted by Sopinka J. at p. 328, it is "essentially a practical question of fact which can best be answered by ordinary common sense". Although the burden of proof remains with the plaintiff, in some circumstances an inference of causation may be drawn from the evidence without positive scientific proof.
It is not now necessary, nor has it ever been, for the plaintiff to establish that the defendant's negligence was the sole cause of the injury. There will frequently be a myriad of other background events which were necessary preconditions to the injury occurring. [...] As long as a defendant is part of the cause of an injury, the defendant is liable, even though his act alone was not enough to create the injury. There is no basis for a reduction of liability because of the existence of other preconditions: defendants remain liable for all injuries caused or contributed to by their negligence.
145  Causation must be determined prior to the assessment of damages, and must not be confused with the rules of assessing damages once causation is established: Blackwater v. Plint,  at para. 78.
146  Applying the test set out in Athey, I must decide whether the evidence establishes that the accident caused the plaintiff's injuries to her left breast, in terms of the rupture of her breast implant and the formation of the necrotic lump, as well as the pain and other discomfort she experienced in the area of her left breast. It is not necessary that the accident be the sole cause, or that causation be established to scientific precision. To succeed the plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that the accident was a contributing factor, outside the de minimis range.
147  In Wilson v. MacKay,  (S.C.) [Wilson], Dorgan J., after reviewing the judgment of Sopinka J. in Snell v. Farrell, , considered the burden of proof and the inference of causation in the context of alleged medical malpractice that resulted in breast asymmetry and scarring following breast reduction surgery. Dorgan J. stated the following at para. 89:
In summary, the plaintiff need not prove causation with scientific precision. The plaintiff may present evidence which, if believed, may lead to an inference adverse to the defendant.
The learned judge then found that the plaintiff had not discharged the onus of proof upon her, except in relation to an extra incision made to her right breast.
148  In the present case I accept the testimony of the plaintiff that prior to the accident she had symmetrical breasts after breast augmentation surgery. I accept that she noticed that she had a substantially smaller left breast about three weeks after the accident, and that since the accident she had experiencing pain and burning sensations in the area of her left breast. I further accept her evidence that at the same time she found the lump in her left breast. Several weeks later, Dr. Horton diagnosed the lump to be a lump of necrotic fat due to trauma in the area of the ruptured left breast implant. When I combine their evidence and consider that the plaintiff as the driver of a motor vehicle was wearing the usual shoulder/lap seatbelt across the area of her left upper body including her left breast, I find without hesitation that the plaintiff has established that the accident was at least a partial cause of rupture of the left breast implant and the associated complications. Thus, the defendant is liable for the injuries sustained by the plaintiff to the area of her left breast, including the rupture of the implant.
149  In relation to the soft-tissue injuries suffered by the plaintiff to her neck, left shoulder, arm and wrist caused by the accident, the defendant submits that the plaintiff was substantially recovered by August 2007 when she enrolled in the welding course. Thus, any continuing weakness, pain, or disability that the plaintiff claims continues to exist in her left arm and wrist past that time, the defendant submits is not proven to be caused or contributed to by the accident. On the totality of the evidence before me I agree with that submission, except that I find the date to be in September 2007 after her visit to Dr. Ticea on September 7, 2007. I find that the preponderance of the evidence points towards the plaintiff being substantially recovered from injuries to her neck, left shoulder, and left arm as of August 2007, when she then injured her right arm, and in any event by mid-September 2007.
150  I find that the continuing weakness in her left wrist and hand as identified by Mr. Banks is not established to be related to the accident. While he identifies this weakness and restricted motion in the plaintiff's left wrist and hand well after August 2007, there is no reliable medical evidence to support any continuing weakness and disability beyond that date as being caused or contributed to by the accident. I do not find the plaintiff to be a sufficiently accurate or reliable witness to accept her evidence that this was not a pre-existing problem or caused by some unrelated activity. It is also possible the disparity may be related to right-hand dominance, if the plaintiff is indeed right-handed. I note that Mr. Banks assessed the plaintiff on August 18, 2008, which was almost two years after the accident and after the intervening events of the plaintiff taking the welding course and attempting to work as a welder.
151  I also find that Dr. Ticea's evidence does not establish an ongoing weakness in the plaintiff's left wrist beyond September 7, 2007. This is because the plaintiff's complaints regarding pain in her neck, left shoulder, arm and wrist are only sporadic at best after this point and were in the main eclipsed by other presumably more pressing medical concerns unrelated to the accident. It is equally likely that the plaintiff's complaints of pain in relation to those areas of her body have been caused or substantially aggravated by taking the welding course and trying to work as a welder, an occupation for which she may have been not physically well-suited from the outset. I also note that the nerve conduction studies sought by Dr. Ticea in relation to injuries sustained in the accident were apparently negative. No neurological or other expert medical evidence was called to support an inference that the plaintiff's ongoing weakness in her left wrist and hand is related to the accident. It is also possible that continuing to have the ruptured left breast implant in her chest has contributed to pain in her left shoulder and arm. There is, quite simply, insufficient evidence to establish that the plaintiff's present complaints and some weakness in her left wrist and hand are related to the accident, except for her specific discomfort in the area of her left breast.
152  Therefore, I find that the plaintiff suffered soft tissue, whiplash-related injuries to her neck, left shoulder, arm and wrist in the accident and that these injuries, classified at a "Grade II" by Dr. Ticea caused her considerable pain and discomfort that abated with the active rehabilitation program she took in March and April 2007 to the point that she was substantially recovered by September 2007. Any remaining pain or residual weakness in the plaintiff's left wrist after that time is not proven to be caused in whole or in part by the accident.
153  In relation to her ruptured left breast implant, I find that the plaintiff has experienced considerable pain, discomfort, disfigurement, and mental stress and anxiety that continue to the present time.
Damage Awards Sought by the Plaintiff
154  I turn now to determine the extent of the losses suffered by the plaintiff proven to arise from the accident and the appropriate quantum of damages in relation to these losses under the various heads of damages claimed.
155  Counsel for the plaintiff submits that in this case an appropriate range of the total damages under all the headings is in the range of $506,949 to $691,595. He submits that significant awards under the various heads of damages are warranted because of the debilitating and painful injuries the plaintiff sustained in the accident and their protracted impact on her life, in terms of pain, loss of enjoyment, limitations on physical exercise and housekeeping, loss of income from employment, and the loss of greater income, job security, and job satisfaction that she was unable to achieve due to being unable to work as a welder.
156  Counsel for the defendant takes a completely different view of this case. Having submitted that the plaintiff's ruptured breast implant is not proven to have been caused by the accident, and that the accident was a minor one with minimal damage to both vehicles and the only sign of physical injury to the plaintiff being the bruising to her left arm, he submits that an appropriate award in all the circumstances is in the range of $25,000 for non-pecuniary damages. He consents to an award for past wage loss of $9,336 in gross income. Otherwise, it is submitted on behalf of the defendant that no other damage awards are appropriate on the facts of this case.
Non-pecuniary loss
157  The plaintiff seeks a total award of non-pecuniary damages in the range of $153,881 to $194,213, comprised of an award of non-pecuniary damages in the range of $58,881 to $81,363 related to the plaintiff's ruptured left breast implant; an award in the range of $60,000 to $77,850 in relation to the plaintiff's soft-tissue injuries and the increased frequency and intensity of migraine headaches she claims to have suffered after the accident, and an award in the range of $35,000 for emotional distress.
158  As stated, the defendant's position is that a total award for non-pecuniary damages in this case ought to be in the range of $25,000.
The ruptured left breast implant
159  To support an award in the range sought, the plaintiff relies upon the following authorities: Hollis v. Birch,  (S.C.) [Hollis]; Rennick v. Miller,  (S.C.) [Rennick]; and Wilson.
160  I have reviewed the above cases and considered their similarities and differences to the case at bar. In Hollis, a 1990 decision, the judge awarded $50,000 in relation to non-pecuniary damages arising from the surgical replacement of negligently manufactured breast implant. In Rennick, a 1996 decision, the award was $45,000 in the case of a left breast implant that was ruptured in a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff in that case required both implants to be surgically replaced and suffered left-arm strain and bruising that resolved shortly, as well as headaches. In Wilson, a 1993 decision, the plaintiff was awarded $40,000 for disfigurement of her right breast that required corrective surgery. She also suffered ongoing physical and psychological pain.
161  In the present case the left implant will be replaced. It is not known if the right implant will also have to be replaced to achieve breasts of a similar size. The plaintiff has endured considerable pain and suffering, the painful and difficult injections of the lump of necrotic fat by Dr. Horton. She has also had to endure the ongoing discomfort and emotional and psychological upset and distress caused by the ruptured implant remaining in her chest and the very significant disparity in the size of her breasts for a period of three years and three months. In all the circumstances I find that a fit and proper award in non-pecuniary damages for this injury is $65,000.
Soft-tissue Injuries and Migraine Headaches
162  To support an award in the range of $60,000 to $77,850, the plaintiff relies upon the following authorities: Andres v. Leslie,  [Andres]; Bancroft-Wilson v. Murphy,  [Bancroft-Wilson]; Ghataurah v. Fike,  [Ghataurah]; Heartt v. Royal,  [Heartt]; Heppner v. Zia,  [Heppner]; Klein v. Dowhy,  [Klein]; Kuskis v. Tin,  [Kuskis]; and Pratt v. Barlow,  [Pratt].
163  To support an award in the range the defendant finds to be appropriate, namely in the range of $25,000, the defendant relies upon the following authorities: Price v. Kostryb a  (S.C.) [Price]; Reyes v. Pascual,  [Reyes]; Job v. Van Blankers,  [Job]; Aulakh v. Poirier,  [Aulakh]; and Garcha v. Gill,  [Garcha].
164  Having reviewed the authorities provided in the context of the present case with regards to the plaintiff's the soft-tissue injuries to her neck, left shoulder, and left arm and wrist, and taking into account a modest increase in the frequency and severity of her chronic and pre-existing migraine headaches, from which I have found she was substantially recovered in September 2007, I find that an award of $30,000 is appropriate as non-pecuniary damages for these injuries.
Emotional Distress
165  Plaintiff's counsel seeks an award of up to $35,000 for emotional distress. He submits that the plaintiff has suffered significant mental distress and psychological problems as a result of the injuries she sustained in the accident, most specifically in relation to the rupture of her left breast implant and the complications arising from it. He submits that the testimony of Mr. Chaloner and the plaintiff's daughter, Chandra Mayoh, supports the testimony of the plaintiff in this regard.
166  In her testimony, the plaintiff said that she has suffered periods of depression, sadness, distress, and lower-self esteem from the injuries she sustained in the accident, her ongoing pain in her left shoulder and reduced mobility in her left wrist, and increased problems with migraines, in addition to the stress, worry, and discomfort arising from her collapsed left breast implant. Her evidence is that feeling depressed, sad, and in pain has caused her to withdraw socially, impacted negatively on her relationships with her children, and prevented her from dating and exercising as she has in the past.
167  Her claim under this head of damages is not supported by any medical, psychiatric or psychological evidence. I note that Dr. Ticea referred the plaintiff to a psychologist but the plaintiff said that she could not afford to go, and did not attend counselling. Although the plaintiff was referred to a psychiatrist, Dr. Rana, there is no evidence from this person.
168  Damages for psychological injuries were recently discussed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Mustapha v. Culligan of Canada Ltd.,  [Mustapha] at para. 9:
[P]sychological disturbance that rises to the level of personal injury must be distinguished from psychological upset. Personal injury at law connotes serious trauma or illness: see Hinz v. Berry, [1970] 2 Q.B. 40 (C.A.), at p. 42; Page v. Smith, [1996] 1 A.C. 155, at p. 189; Linden and Feldthusen, at pp. 425-27. The law does not recognize upset, disgust, anxiety, agitation or other mental states that fall short of injury. I would not purport to define compensable injury exhaustively, except to say that it must be serious and prolonged and rise above the ordinary annoyances, anxieties and fears that people living in society routinely, if sometimes reluctantly, accept. The need to accept such upsets rather than seek redress in tort is what I take the Court of Appeal to be expressing in its quote from Vanek v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Co. of Canada  (C.A.): "Life goes on" (para. 60). Quite simply, minor and transient upsets do not constitute personal injury, and hence do not amount to damage.
169  That case dealt with a tort where there was no physical injury at all, but the discussion of compensable injury is relevant nonetheless. In a very recent case, Kotai v. Queen of the North (The), , Joyce J. conducted a very thorough review of the case law around emotional distress, including Mustapha, when determining whether damages for emotional distress would result from the sinking of a ferry that the plaintiffs were aboard and concluded, at para. 69:
Accordingly, I conclude that there remains a requirement that the claimants prove not just psychological disturbance or upset as a result of the defendant's negligence but also that their psychological disturbance rises to the level of a recognizable psychiatric illness.
170  Based on these cases, I decline to make a separate award of damages for the plaintiff's emotional distress. The plaintiff simply did not provide any evidence which suggests that her emotional distress came to the level of a recognizable psychiatric illness. Nor do I attribute her emotional distress entirely to the accident and her collapsed breast implant, but also to other life stressors including her separation, being a single parent, financial worries, problems with her son, and her lack of success in the welding trade, all of which I find to be unrelated to the accident. In addition, to my mind, the specific claims above for non-pecuniary damages by definition include a measure of pain and suffering related to the injuries sustained in the accident and their aftermath, including in relation to the ruptured breast implant.
Loss of Future Income and Future Earning Capacity
171  The plaintiff seeks an award in the range of $300,000 to $400,000 for loss of future income and future earning capacity as a result of injuries she sustained in the accident. She relies on the approach taken by Finch J.A., as he then was, in Pallos v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia  at paras. 24-27. In addition, the plaintiff relies upon Earnshaw v. Despins  (C.A.) at 399; Palmer v. Goodall  (C.A.) at 59; Rosvold v. Dunlop,  at para. 9; and Kuskis at paras. 151-154.
172  The defendant's position is that there is no evidence upon which to make an award for loss of future earning capacity. The defendant refers to the following authorities in relation to future income loss: Job at para. 47; Steward, , at para. 14; Bedwell v. McGill,  [Bedwell]; and Chang v. Feng,  at paras. 73-79 [Chang].
173  The law in British Columbia around the awarding of damages for loss of future earning capacity has been interpreted differently over the last fifteen years, with differences between a "capital asset" approach and a "future possibility" approach. However, two recent Court of Appeal decisions have given strong direction to trial judges in the way in which these damages should be determined.
174  In Rosvold, Huddart J.A. reviewed the principles relating to these awards and stated, at para. 8, that an "award for loss of earning capacity is based on the recognition that a plaintiff's capacity to earn income is an asset which has been taken away ... What is being compensated is not lost projected future earnings but the loss or impairment of earning capacity as a capital asset". This has been referred to as the capital asset approach. Huddart J.A. continued, at para. 10, to canvas several other cases to come up with a list of four factors the trial judge should consider in this regard:
whether the plaintiff has been rendered less capable overall from earning income from all types of employment;
whether the plaintiff is less marketable or attractive as an employee to potential employers;
whether the plaintiff has lost the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities which might otherwise have been open to him, had he not been injured; and
whether the plaintiff is less valuable to himself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour market.
175  However, the capital asset approach appears to have been overtaken in two more recent Court of Appeal decisions. In Steward, a 2007 decision, the trial judge, , found that the plaintiff may have earned as much in the future as he would have if not injured in his current profession, but awarded $50,000 for "compensation for the impairment of his earning capacity in other occupations that may now be closed to him." The Court of Appeal rejected this analysis, and held, at para. 17, that "the claimant bears the onus to prove at trial a substantial possibility of a future event leading to an income loss, and the court must then award compensation on an estimation of the chance that the event will occur" [emphasis added]. Donald J.A. went on to hold that because there was no other realistic alternative occupation that would be impaired by the plaintiff's injuries, the claim for future loss must fail, and reduced the award to zero.
176  Then, in Bedwell, a 2008 decision, the trial judge, , found that the plaintiff's injuries did not make her less marketable, less valuable, or less capable overall of earning income from all types of employment. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge and stated, at para. 53, that "it was necessary for the appellant to have proven a substantial possibility of a future event leading to an income loss" [emphasis added], and that based on the findings of the trial judge and "lack of evidence that such injuries could lead to a future income loss, it follows that she did not prove such a substantial possibility".
177  The confusion between the two approaches was discussed by Bauman J., as he then was, in Chang. After reviewing Steward, Bauman J. held, at para. 76, that Donald J.A.'s reasons "appears to be an express direction to first enquire into whether there is a substantial possibility of future income loss before one is to embark on assessing the loss under either approach to this head of loss, in particular, under the capital asset approach as well".
178  Another recent decision discussed the factors identified in Rosvold, and their relevance to the analysis. In Job, Ker J. did not decide whether to use the capital asset approach or the future possibility approach, but found, at para. 134, that to be able to claim any damages under either approach:
[T]he plaintiff must put forward cogent evidence that she has been rendered less capable overall of earning income from all types of employment, that she is less marketable, that she cannot take advantage of job opportunities she otherwise might have, or is less valuable as a person capable of earning income.
179  Given this case law, I find that in order to succeed in her claim for loss of future income, the plaintiff must first prove a substantial possibility of a future event leading to an income loss. This possibility can be proven with reference to the four factors identified by Huddart J.A. in Rosvold. If the plaintiff proves that possibility, it is then open to the Court to value that loss based on either the capital asset approach or based on what the plaintiff would have earned but for her injuries.
180  I find that the evidence placed before the court falls significantly short of establishing that her injuries from the accident have resulted in a substantial possibility of a future event leading to an income loss. I have come to this finding with reference to the four factors referred to in Rosvold. Firstly and as indicated previously, I am not satisfied that the residual weaknesses identified by Mr. Banks in the plaintiff's left wrist and hand were caused or contributed to by the accident. On the evidence those would be the injuries that would render the plaintiff less capable overall of earning income in the future. Second, given that I have found that she was substantially recovered from the soft-tissue injuries by September 2007, with the exception of the replacement of the left breast implant yet to be repaired, there is no evidence that she is less marketable as a result of injuries sustained in the accident, as there is no suggestion that the implant surgery will leave her with a lasting injury or deficit that will impact future employment. Third, in terms of job opportunities that she otherwise would have taken advantage of absent injuries from the accident, there is very little evidence of the plaintiff's work history prior to the accident before the court with the exception of her year of employment as a meat packer at Hill's immediately preceding the accident. Her income in recent past years does not lend support to an inference that the plaintiff has job opportunities available that are likely to be adversely impacted by injuries sustained in the accident. She reported to Mr. Banks that she had worked previously for an unspecified time as a bartender but no details were provided. Her plan to become a welder did not materialize beyond her struggling with the training and less than a month of welding employment. I find that it is too big a leap to assume that the plaintiff would have worked for many future years as a welder, or indeed regularly in any job or occupation, and then to assess loss of future capacity based on the projections by Mr. Benning.
181  For these reasons I decline to award any amount for loss of future income and future earning capacity.
Past Wage Loss and Past Loss of Opportunities
182  The plaintiff and the defendant have agreed that the plaintiff lost $9,336 in gross income due to being unable to work after the accident, resulting in a net figure of approximately $8,400. Accordingly, I award $8,400 in past wage loss.
Loss of Housekeeping Capacity
183  The plaintiff claims damages for loss of housekeeping capacity in the range of $17,235 to $40,392. This is based on the claim that she is less able at present and in the future to clean her house and perform the household duties as she did prior to the accident. The proposed range is based on a cost of $15 per hour with five hours a week being required and then projections of the future costs over the next five, ten, and 15 years, discounted for present value.
184  The defendant submits that the evidence of the plaintiff was that she was able to do her own housekeeping, just with some additional difficulty.
185  The law recognizes that a plaintiff whose ability to perform housekeeping services is diminished in part or in whole ought to be compensated for that loss; that the loss of housekeeping ability is that of the plaintiff and not her family; and that when family members have gratuitously done the work that the plaintiff can no longer do and the tasks they perform have a market value, that value provides a tangible indication of the loss the plaintiff has suffered which enables the court to assign a monetary value: Kroeker v. Jansen  (B.C.C.A.) leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, ; McTavish v. MacGillivray,  [McTavish].
186  However, in the present case, given that I have found that the plaintiff was substantially recovered from the accident by September 2007, I must dismiss her claim for loss of future housekeeping capacity.
187  In terms of replacement housekeeping services performed for the plaintiff by her daughter from the date of the accident to September 2007, a period of 12 months, the evidence before the court is not specific as to the number of hours spent. Nor does it provide a clear list of the kinds of tasks the plaintiff's daughter assumed in her stead beyond shopping for groceries, driving her younger brother to school and, as her mother recovered, moving heavy items for cleaning. There is no indication of the frequency with which she performed these tasks or the time she spent. Without this type of evidence I find that I am unable to quantify and value the replacement services provided by the plaintiff's daughter to assist the plaintiff during this 12 month period. Therefore, I am unable to make a specific award to compensate the plaintiff for these housekeeping tasks, as is contemplated in McTavish at para. 68.
Cost of Future Care
188  The plaintiff claims future care costs related to the replacement of the ruptured left breast implant ($5,883), and double that amount if both breasts require replacement implants to achieve symmetry.
189  She also seeks an award for future care costs for her on-going injuries to cover medications (Advil, Topimax, Imitrex, and a nasal spray) and water therapy, physiotherapy and a gym membership, calculated over the next five, ten, or 15 years, resulting in a present value range of $28,776 to $59,316.
190  The defendant submits that there is no evidence upon which to base an award for future care costs.
191  The test to be applied when the court considers awarding the cost of future care is set out by McLachlin J., as she then was, in Milina v. Bartsch  at 84 [Milina] as follows:
The test for determining the appropriate award under the heading of cost of future care, it may be inferred, is an objective one based on medical evidence.
These authorities establish:
that there must be a medical justification for claims for cost of future care; and
that the claims must be reasonable.
[...]
The award for cost of care should reflect what the evidence establishes is reasonably necessary to preserve the plaintiff's health.
192  Given that I have found that the plaintiff has not proven on-going injury related to the accident after September 2007, I find that there is no legal basis for an award in relation to the future care costs as sought by the plaintiff, with the exception of the cost to replace the ruptured left breast implant.
193  In relation to the surgery required to replace the left breast implant, I award $5,883 as a onetime cost for that purpose. Based on the evidence it is likely that the plaintiff will require medication related to that surgery for pain management and to reduce the risk of infection. As no amount is specifically allocated to this purpose but rather there are much larger amounts claimed as part of the plaintiff's claim for future care, somewhat arbitrarily I award the plaintiff an additional $500 for medications related to the breast implant replacement surgery, for a total amount of $6,383. However, I decline to order double that amount for future breast implant replacement surgery to cover the possibility that the plaintiff's right breast implant may also have to be exchanged to achieve breasts of more or less equal size. The evidence of Dr. Horton acknowledges that as a possibility only.
Special Damages
194  The plaintiff claims $4,038.71 for special damages for physiotherapy sessions, various prescribed medications, a doctor's note, and a visit to an occupational therapist.
195  It is well established that the plaintiff is entitled to recover as special damages all the pre-trial expenses she incurred as a result of her injuries, so long as they were caused by the tort and the decision to incur them was reasonable: see Jamie Cassels, Remedies: The Law of Damages (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2000) at p. 116. When assessing the quantum of damages under any recognized head, the court is concerned, ultimately, with making the party whole. McLachlin J., as she then was, described this animating principle in Milina at 78:
The fundamental governing precept is restitutio in integrum. The injured person is to be restored to the position he would have been in had the accident not occurred, insofar as this can be done with money. This is the philosophical justification for damages for loss of earning capacity, cost of future care and special damages.
196  I have reviewed the schedule of special expenses claimed and find the amount claimed to be in order. Therefore, I award $4,038.71.
Mitigation
197  The issue arises as to what extent, if any, the plaintiff failed to mitigate the injuries and symptoms caused by the accident by not following the prescribed treatment plan or engaging in activities not conducive to full recovery.
198  In particular, counsel for the defendant submits that the plaintiff has failed to mitigate her losses by failing to return to Florida to have the ruptured breast implant replaced by the plastic surgeon who implanted it, given that Dr. Horton testified that is it common for there to be warranties on breast implants and for the original surgeons to perform follow-up operations without additional charge when an implant ruptures. He submits that the plaintiff indicated that she was aware that there was a five year warranty on her implants, and that she had failed to make any inquiries as to the cost of travelling to Florida to have the ruptured implant replaced, as opposed to continuing to seek coverage for the replacement through her insurer.
199  He also submits that although the plaintiff testified that she had sought loans from a number of people to assist her with this procedure she failed to call evidence to that effect, and her mother, Ms. Mayoh, denied being asked by her daughter for a loan to contribute to the payment for the procedure. The position taken on behalf of the defendant is ultimately not that she ought to have found and paid the estimated cost of $6,000 to replace the ruptured implant, but that her efforts to investigate alternatives were not adequate.
200  In reference to his submission that the plaintiff has failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate her damages, particularly in relation to the collapsed implant, counsel for the defendant refers to Antoniali v. Massey, , in which Preston J. considered whether the plaintiff had unreasonably failed to mitigate by failing to embark on an exercise program under the supervision of a personal trainer to rehabilitate herself or alleviate the continuing effect of her injuries. He also referred to Job, where Ker J. reduced an award of non-pecuniary damages by 10% due to the plaintiff's failure to mitigate by following the treatment regime recommended by her physician at the time the recommendation was made, even though she found, at para. 114, "it meant some initial financial hardship in terms of ability to pay for the treatments".
201  In response, counsel for the plaintiff submits that the plaintiff has mitigated honourably by attending physiotherapy, then fully participating in the active rehabilitation program recommended by her physician and available to her through ICBC, followed by doing the recommended exercises and stretching thereafter. He submits that it is simply too much to expect a plaintiff, particularly someone in his client's position to come up with $6,000 for this kind of surgery, particularly when she is dealing with other injuries arising from the accident, and no longer lives in Florida.
202  The law imposes upon plaintiffs the duty to mitigate their losses. This includes taking reasonable steps to minimize any loss relating to their injuries. Its purpose is to prevent plaintiffs from seeking recovery from defendants for harm and loss caused or contributed to by their own neglect. The onus of proof rests upon the defendant to establish a failure on the part of the plaintiff to mitigate, and whether a plaintiff has been reasonable in refusing to accept the recommended medical treatment is a decision for the trier of fact:  Janiak v. Ippolito, .
203  I find, considering the plaintiff's overall circumstances, including the other injuries she sustained in the accident and her conduct in terms of regular attendances to her doctor, and fully participating in the physiotherapy and the rehabilitation program that were recommended to her, that it cannot be said that she unreasonably failed to mitigate. I have taken into account her failure to take psychological and psychiatric counselling in terms of making no award for emotional distress, but I am firmly of the view that it is unreasonable for counsel for the defendant to assert that she ought to have flown to Florida and incurred whatever costs were associated with having the ruptured implant replaced there. As her counsel pointed out, there is a significant difference between a $15 user fee and personally incurring significant costs associated with such a surgery, which is estimated to cost approximately $6,000 if performed in British Columbia by Dr. Horton.
Conclusion
204  For these reasons I find that the plaintiff has established the following claims in damages in the following amounts arising from the accident, for a total of $113,821.71:
Non-pecuniary damages -- $95,000;
Loss of future income and future earning capacity -- nil;
Past wage loss -- $8,400;
Loss of housekeeping ability -- nil;
Cost of future care -- $6,383; and
Special damages -- $4,038.71.
205  The plaintiff is also entitled to interest pursuant to the Court Order Interest Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 79.
206  I find that the plaintiff is entitled to costs at Scale B payable forthwith, unless the parties provide notification to the Registry and Trial Scheduling within 21 days of the date of filing of this judgment. In the event further submission are to be made they are to be in writing and the plaintiff is to file such written submissions within 21 days of the notice referred to above, the defendant is to respond within 14 days thereafter, and the plaintiff is to file any further brief written reply within a further 7 days.
