In his words, he wants to \"paralyze\" them financially and professionally. I must say that that appears to be a completely disproportionate response to any of the more rational of his allegations and it smacks of malice. He also stated that a secondary motive is to expose and help rectify what he perceives as systemic discrimination in the medical profession against immigrant minorities.

The collision was caused by the negligence of the defendant Crystal Levien in failing to maintain a proper lookout as she drove northbound on the highway. The defendant Karen Levien was the registered owner of the vehicle driven by Crystal Levien. Karen Levien had given her consent to allow Crystal Levien to drive. Consequently, she is vicariously liable for the negligence of Crystal Levien. I have found no contributory negligence by the plaintiff.

The plaintiff did not provide any year-end financial statements, but only revenue and expense statements of various periods of time. The documents do not disclose any capital cost allowance. Also, some of the expenses claimed are wages for salaried employees that would have been paid whether or not the flood occurred and the golf course was closed. The revenues used as comparables included pre-sold rounds of golf that would have been used at some later date, and the rental of equipment includes periods of time when it would be impossible for the plaintiff to be doing work as a result of the flood. The claim of the plaintiff also includes a claim for May 22, 2002, a day in which the golf course would have been closed in any event because there was 13.4 mm of rain. A further claim for damage to a bridge that was 15 years old and made of wood does not seem to be reasonable.

Although the amount of damages claimed against Mr. Majorani is close to 44% of the total damages claimed in the S064987 action, and the number of automobiles he was claimed to be at fault for represents about 48% of the total number of automobiles in the action, I find that the appropriate amount of costs to award him on Scale B is 20% of the pre-trial costs and disbursements, and 20% of the trial costs and disbursements. To award a higher amount may overcompensate Mr. Majorani for the efforts required of his counsel at trial, particularly as he shared counsel with Ms. Muzsik.\n",

      "17  In my view, it would be appropriate for Mr. Schlesiger to have the four weeks he seeks to review the documents from Clark Wilson. I also am of the view that the City and the PGT's applications for summary trial should be heard together as they cover similar ground. However, Mr. Schlesiger should have the benefit of the City's list of documents in advance and the ability to review the disclosure. A date for hearing should be set to accommodate this period of review. While the arguments of both the PGT and the City are persuasive in regard to moving the matter forward now, the summary trial rules permit the court to order further steps to be taken, if it is found necessary for the making of a proper determination on the merits. To avoid unnecessary delay at that stage, it is my view that prudence dictates the approach I have set out. Accordingly, the summary trial applications of the PGT and the City of Surrey are adjourned, and a date for the hearing of those applications should be set within a time period that accords with this ruling.\n",
