      "conclusion of the forceps attempt.\n",
      "conclusion that it is more likely than not the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the result. A mere possibility of such causation is not enough; and when the matter remains one of pure speculation or conjecture, or the probabilities are at best evenly balanced, it becomes the duty of the court to direct a verdict for the defendant.\n",
      "conclusion in Cherry v. Borsman, as described above, may no longer apply. This enlarged position effectively subsumes Dr. Johnston's original position. However, because of the manner in which the case was presented and argued in the trial, with further written submissions after judgment was reserved, it seems most convenient and responsive to the weight and direction of counsels' submissions to address first the matter of informed consent and the fetus, and then the larger question of whether a physician owes any duty of care to a fetus.\n",
      "conclusion that the doctor owed no legal duty to the unborn children in this case.\n",
      "conclusions, and more from an examination of those issues and conclusions as illuminated by the factual context of the case from which they arose. At the time of Dr. Ramji's impugned conduct, the infant plaintiff in Paxton was not yet conceived; indeed, it was the very fact of her later conception that based her claim. This suggests to be obiter dicta those of the comments in the Court's reasons that are sufficiently broad to relate to whether there exists a duty to a conceived living fetus. By a reading of Paxton v. Ramji that proceeds no further than its facts, the Court simply confirms its conclusion not long before in Bovingdon v. Hergott (also in reasons of Feldman J.A. for the Court) that no duty of care is owed to an unconceived child.\n",
      "conclusion that the jurisprudence was unsettled, but those authorities dealt primarily -- perhaps exclusively -- with \"wrongful life\" cases, that rested on the claim that the plaintiff children never should have been born at all. Feldman J.A. rejected the analysis that rests on whether such a claim is for \"wrongful life\" or \"wrongful birth\", and concluded that, rather, a court must ask whether there is a duty of care owed by the defendant to a plaintiff.\n",
      "conclusion that \"[t]he concept that a duty is owed to a fetus is not a novel one\", and rejected the submission that no such duty of care was owed. Indeed, the duty to the fetus, in Cherry v. Borsman, survived even the duty of care to the mother to, at her request, perform an abortion to end the life of the fetus:\n",
      "conclusion.\n",
      "conclusion that the physician owes a duty to the fetus, as a necessary consequence of the duty he or she owes to the mother.\n",
      "conclusion that a physician may have a proximate relationship with the fetus. For example:\n",
      "conclusion that the duty of care that her physician owes the mother also encompasses her fetus. To recognize such a duty of care to the fetus does not acknowledge, in the fetus, a separate legal status at that stage, which might therefore conflict with the mother's autonomy, because, as existing jurisprudence makes clear, any legal rights accruing as a result of a duty of care owed before birth crystallize only at the time of the fetus' live birth. Thus, an infant child may sue a third party tortfeasor for injury caused to the fetus before birth, the necessary duty of care well-recognized in that context:\n",
      "conclusion that the workers admitted under this program have the necessary skills for Cassidy's care, and the indicated salary level suggests that qualified workers are unlikely to commit to Cassidy's care beyond the very short term. Common sense indicates that a caregiver with the necessary skills, personal qualities, experience, and dedication for Cassidy's care will not likely find long-term satisfaction in a salary at or barely above the minimum wage.\n",
      "conclusions concerning the cost of Cassidy's care to age 19, I infer that qualified live-in care will be available privately, after age 19, at $200 per day (somewhat less than the agency rate of $275-$300 indicated by Ms. Landy), with the necessary four hours of daily relief care at $22 per hour. The costs, on this basis, for Cassidy's lifetime after 19, would be approximately $100,000 per year, with, in total, a present value of approximately $860,000.\n",
      "Conclusion re Future Care\n",
      "conclusion that, in addition to the 70 percent of adult Canadian women in married or equivalent interdependent relationships, another 10 percent enjoy the value of other financially interdependent relationships. The examples to which Mr. Carson briefly referred do not necessarily entail any financial advantage beyond that which flows from the fact that two can live more cheaply than one. They do not describe relationships of long-term interdependence with legally enforceable obligations of mutual support. Nor do they appear to describe relationships involving an economic trade-off of earnings by one partner for the non-financial contributions (such as child-raising and other non-remunerative activities) of the other partner. It is difficult to see, therefore, how those relationships have a financial value that will be unavailable to Cassidy through similar accommodation-sharing arrangements.\n",

      "1   The plaintiff, Ms. Nelson, claims damages from the defendants based on negligence. The Plaintiff asserts that the defendant, Ms. Tucker, while performing her duties as a nurse employed by the defendant B.C. Women's Hospital, breached a duty of care owed to Ms. Nelson, and that injury resulted. There is no issue that the defendants owed a duty to Ms. Nelson; the question is whether it was breached, and, if it were, did injury ensue. The breach is alleged to have occurred during the period of labour leading to the birth of Ms. Nelson's daughter in 2009. Specifically, Ms. Nelson claims that while she was under the influence of an epidural anaesthetic, and unable to control her legs, Ms. Tucker allowed her left leg to drop, which caused injury to Ms. Nelson's left hip\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "2  Ms. Nelson was 39 years old, married to Dr. Beaudoin, a chiropractor, and pregnant with her first child, when she went into labour on April 30, 2009. She went to B.C. Women's Hospital at about 5:00 p.m., where she was joined by Dr. Beaudoin, who remained with her until their daughter was born via a forceps-assisted delivery at 9:20 a.m. May 1\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "3  Shortly after 7:00 p.m. on April 30, the defendant Ms. Tucker assumed primary nursing responsibility for Ms. Nelson. Ms. Tucker was and is a fully qualified registered nurse, having trained in England as both a nurse and a midwife, and having practised both disciplines before being recruited to join B.C. Women's Hospital about eight months before Ms. Nelson's labour and delivery\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "4  Ms. Nelson was Ms. Tucker's only patient during the latter's 12-hour shift that ended at 7:00 a.m. May 1\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "5  An anaesthetist administered an epidural anaesthetic at 8:15 p.m. April 30, and a further dose, referred to in the hospital record as a bolus, at 5:15 a.m. on May 1. Ms. Nelson also had access to smaller doses of the epidural anaesthetic through equipment that allowed her to push a button and obtain a limited amount and number of additional dosages if she felt the pain was too great. The epidural anaesthetic reduced sensation, including both pain and motor control, in Ms. Nelson's lower body to the point that after the first administration, she had little or no ability to move her legs\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "6  The events giving rise to the allegation of negligence happened between 6:30 a.m. and 7:00 am. May 1, while Ms. Nelson was still under Ms. Tucker's care. Ms. Nelson says that Ms. Tucker attached what is called a birthing bar to Ms. Nelson's bed, so that Ms. Nelson could try a different position, called a ski or waterski position, to help her push during contractions. The report of Ms. King, an expert in nursing matters, describes this position in this way:\n",
      "The patient is positioned on her back with the head of the bed elevated to their comfort. The patient's legs are positioned with knees bent and spread apart with each foot placed in a foot pedal which is located on either side of the bed approximately one third up from the bottom of the bed.\n",
      "A birthing bar is placed where the foot pedals are. This birthing bar arches from one side of the bed to the other. A sheet or towel is then tied around the middle of the arch of the birthing bar.\n",
      "The patient pulls on the sheet or towel with her feet in the foot pedals while she pushes during her contractions with coaching from the nurse. This position resembles someone who is waterskiing.\n",
      "This position is helpful for patients with an epidural in coaching the patient to push effectively\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "7  Ms. Nelson says that she tried this ski position for perhaps half an hour, but she did not find it comfortable, so it was discontinued. She says that at one point during the half hour, while she was between contractions, Ms. Tucker and Dr. Beaudoin placed her feet or ankles on the top of the birthing bar to rest and stretch her legs. Ms. Tucker was on Ms. Nelson's left side, and Dr. Beaudoin on her right. Ms. Nelson says that Ms. Tucker let go of her left leg and turned to do something, and her left leg fell off the birthing bar. Ms. Nelson is not sure how far her leg fell, or whether it landed on the bed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "8  Ms. Nelson said that Ms. Tucker saw that her leg had dropped, and said she was sorry, to which Ms. Nelson replied that she had felt nothing. She told Ms. Tucker not to worry about it. Ms. Nelson said that she gave little thought to the leg drop incident afterward because it had seemed so innocuous at the time\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "9  Ms. Tucker has no independent recollection of Ms. Nelson, her labour, or the events of that shift. She testified that she had never placed a patient's feet or ankles on top of a birthing bar, and has never seen it done. At her examination for discovery, Ms. Tucker said she could not recall ever using such a position, which is a somewhat less definite statement that at trial she interpreted as meaning that she had never used it herself. Ms. Tucker testified that having the patient's feet on top of the birthing bar would not assist during the pushing stage of labour, and, because an epidural anaesthetic works by gravity, such a position would cause the drug to flow toward the upper body, rather than the lower body where it was supposed to block pain. Ms. Tucker said that a patient's feet elevated to the top of a birthing bar could lead to hypertension, and might be bad for the foetal heart, although she agreed this risk could be reduced by raising the head of the bed slightly\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "10  Ms. Tucker doubts that Ms. Nelson had as little motor control as she claims, because the ski position would not be possible without some patient control over her legs. Ms. Tucker also said that if Ms. Nelson's leg had dropped, she would have documented that fact, and informed the nurse in charge, as well as the nurse who relieved her, so the new nurse could be aware of the incident and watch for any consequences\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "11  The forceps delivery caused significant tearing to Ms. Nelson's vagina and perineum that required suturing. This caused her pain in the period immediately following the delivery, beyond that which would naturally follow a prolonged labour and forceps-assisted delivery\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "12  Ms. Nelson says that she had considerable pain in the days immediately following the birth. She says this pain was in her left rear, left side, and her perineum, that she could not lie on her left side because her buttock was so sore, and that she complained of this pain to the nurses and to her husband while she was still in hospital. The hospital chart does not record complaints of pain, at least untoward pain, nor does it disclose that Ms. Nelson either sought or was given significant painkilling medication in the days following the delivery\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "13  Ms. Nelson and her daughter were discharged home around mid-day on May 3, 2009. She says her buttock and left side continued to be very sore, but as this was her first child, and she was an older first-time mother, she thought the pain she was experiencing was normal. For the first three months after her daughter was born, Ms. Nelson sat on a soft ring to ease the pain in her left buttock and side, says she had trouble climbing stairs, and that lifting her left leg to get into the passenger seat of an automobile caused pain she described as \"excruciating\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "14  The defendants argue that Ms. Nelson's evidence that left hip pain started with the delivery and has continued ever since should not be accepted, primarily because it is not supported by entries in the records of various professionals who treated her from the time of the delivery until about seven months later when the first complaint of left hip pain appears in the records of her family doctor, Dr. Sun\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "15  Ms. Nelson says she complained of pain to a community health nurse who came to see her shortly after she went home, and to Dr. Sun, her family doctor, a week after the birth. Dr. Sun does not recall assessing a hip injury the first time she saw Ms. Nelson after the delivery. In her written opinion, Dr. Sun states that Ms. Nelson complained of soreness in her perineum and pain in her low back radiating into her left buttock, which was not unexpected following a difficult delivery, and that she first became aware of a hip problem in early December 2009, seven months after the birth\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  Ms. Nelson saw her obstetrician, Dr. Bloomenthal, on June 23, 2009, a little over three weeks after the birth. Dr. Bloomenthal's examination required that Ms. Nelson lie on her back with her legs open. Ms. Nelson agreed that she did not complain to Dr. Bloomenthal of hip pain, nor did she mention that her leg had dropped\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  On June 24, 2009, Ms. Nelson went to the B.C. Women's Hospital physiotherapy clinic where she saw Ms. Britnell. Ms. Britnell has no independent recollection of that visit, or a subsequent one on August 12. According to her records, Ms. Britnell administered a test designed to distinguish between pain originating in the pelvis and pain originating in the lower back or spine, and concluded that Ms. Nelson had pelvic girdle pain, which she considered not uncommon after childbirth. Ms. Nelson remembers being told that her body produced a substance that allowed her pelvis to separate during delivery, which she thought would account for the pelvic girdle pain\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  Ms. Nelson's mother was at the hospital during the delivery, although not in the birthing room, and at the Nelson/Beaudoin home shortly after Ms. Nelson was discharged from hospital. She recalls that Ms. Nelson was propped up with a ring under her, and does not recall Ms. Nelson getting off the couch\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  Ms. Jaffer, Ms. Nelson's sister-in-law, saw Ms. Nelson in hospital and at home a day or two after her discharge from hospital. She recalls that Ms. Nelson appeared to be in pain, and was sitting on an inner tube\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "20  Ms. LeBoldus, a friend, saw Ms. Nelson at home in the first month or two after the birth, and said she looked like a new mom, not commenting one way or another on appearance of pain\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "21  Dr. Beaudoin testified that Ms. Nelson appeared to have a lot of pain while still in hospital after the delivery, and at home. He understood that the pain came from Ms. Nelson's perineum, and he had been told that she had some significant tearing in that area. Dr. Beaudoin said that he understood that the perineal tearing had largely healed in three weeks or so, but that Ms. Nelson continued to limp, something that has not changed since. He also understood, I gather based on what Ms. Nelson told him following some of her visits to therapists and others, that an explanation for the pain was that her pelvis had separated during delivery\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "22  Ms. Nelson's credibility is central to the issues in this case. The defendants say she is not telling the truth and they question the reliability or accuracy of her recollection. I will deal more fully with credibility later, but in the meantime, on the evidence before me, I find that Ms. Nelson had not complained of pain or other symptoms referable to her left hip before childbirth. Her evidence on this was supported by Dr. Sun. I conclude that references to clicking in her left hip contained in the records of Dr. Taunton and Ms. Lee relate to symptoms that arose after the birth of Ms. Nelson's daughter, and any suggestion to the contrary arises from misunderstanding or miscommunication between Ms. Nelson and the note-takers. The evidence satisfies me that prior to her pregnancy and delivery, Ms. Nelson was a fit, active woman working full-time at a job that required her to spend a lot of time on her feet. She has been unable to approach that level of fitness or activity since the birth of her daughter, because of left hip pain\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "23  I allow for the fact that Ms. Nelson is interested in the outcome of this action, and that witnesses such as her husband, her mother, and her sister-in-law can be expected to sympathize with and support her. I allow for the possibility that subsequent events have led Ms. Nelson to think back on the pain she experienced after delivery and that it may have become magnified to some extent. Ms. Britnell's investigation of pelvic girdle pain in June 2009, while not specifically related to Ms. Nelson's left hip, provides some support for a finding that the left hip pain started with the labour and delivery\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  On balance, I conclude that Ms. Nelson's left hip pain started immediately after the labour and delivery and has continued ever since\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "25  Of course, a temporal relationship does not establish a causal relationship; this cannot be simply a matter for post hoc reasoning. The next question is why Ms. Nelson's left hip is painful. The answer is not obvious\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  In early summer 2010, Ms. Nelson saw Dr. Taunton on a referral from Dr. Sun. Dr. Taunton thought Ms. Nelson might have a torn labrum, and arranged for diagnostic imaging. On September 2, 2010, Ms. Nelson had an MRI of her left hip that a radiologist interpreted as indicating a torn labrum. On February 24, 2012, Dr. Gilbart, an orthopaedic surgeon, performed an arthroscopic examination and surgery on Ms. Nelson's left hip, during which he repaired her torn labrum. It is clear, and I find, that the torn labrum was, and may still be, one source of Ms. Nelson's ongoing left hip pain. Whether the labrum was torn during Ms. Nelson's labour and delivery, and, if so, how that occurred, is very much in issue\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  The hip joint is a ball and socket arrangement, with the head of the thigh bone, the femur, acting as the ball as it sits in the socket, the acetabulum, formed in the pelvis. Around the edge of the socket there is what Dr. McGraw, also an orthopaedic surgeon, described as fibrocartilagenous structure, called the acetabular labrum\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  Dr. Gilbart testified that a condition known as Femoralacetabular Impingement, or FAI, is a radiographic diagnosis that describes abnormal contact between the hip socket and the femoral head or ball. This occurs when the edge of the socket, the acetabulum, protrudes and overhangs the head of the femur so that it impinges on the femoral head when the hip joint moves in certain ways. Dr. Gilbart resisted calling this an abnormality, preferring to characterize it as a radiological finding. Given what he said about abnormal contact between socket and ball as defining FAI, I take it that he was reluctant to characterize as abnormal an excess of bone at the edge of the socket. If there is too much bone at the front part of the hip socket, or perhaps if the pelvis is tilted, the FAI is classified as pincer-type. Dr. Gilbart testified that pincer-type FAI is very common, with between 10% and 40% of the population having radiological findings of pincer-type FAI. Dr. MGraw testified that because studies are not clear, it is open to debate what portion of population has pincer-type FAI\n",
      "PERCENT MENTIONED\n",
      "['10%', '40%']\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  Ms. Nelson had a pincer-type FAI in her left hip before she went to B.C. Women's Hospital to deliver her baby. Dr. Gilbart testified that the amount by which the front of the socket crosses over determines whether the FAI is classed as mild to severe. He characterized Ms. Nelson's condition as a mild pincer-type FAI in his written report, and as a very mild form of cross over in his evidence. According to Dr. Gilbart, FAI is much more prevalent in the population than are the number of people complaining of symptoms from it. Dr. McGraw was more cautious, saying that he does not think that is known\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  As to a possible relationship between the FAI and the torn labrum, Dr. Gilbart preferred to say that FAI has been associated with labral hip tears rather than that FAI can lead to labral hip tears, I take it because he was not convinced of a causal relationship implied by the latter statement\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  I accept Ms. Nelson's evidence that she had no left hip complaints before her daughter was born. She was supported by Dr. Sun, her family doctor since 2004, who said that Ms. Nelson had not complained of left hip pain before the birth of her daughter. I conclude that Ms. Nelson's FAI was asymptomatic before the birth of her daughter\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "32  Dr. Gilbart and Dr. McGraw differed over whether Ms. Nelson's labrum was torn during her labour and delivery\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "33  In his first written opinion, Dr. McGraw says that labral tears can be either acute or chronic, with acute tears requiring a high energy injury, and chronic tears often associated with hip joints that are not normally configured, as in those exhibiting pincer-type FAI. Of chronic labral tears he says, \"Alternatively, patients may present with a degenerative tear, having had intermittent symptoms of pain and clicking for months to years.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  In Dr. McGraw's opinion, assuming that Ms. Nelson's labrum was normal before she went into the hospital, it would have required significant forces of weight-bearing, rotation and possible hyperextension to tear it, and those forces:\n",
      "... would not be consistent with those that are proposed with the injury. The legs were elevated (hip flexed), knee presumably slightly flexed and leg abducted away from the body. It is suggested that the leg was dropped from this position onto the bed. In the writer's view, this event is inconsistent with the pathology of labral tear described. The engineering report indicates that it would not be possible for the legs to have been upon the birthing bar as described by Ms. Nelson\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  Dr. McGraw testified that he assumed Ms. Nelson's injury may have occurred as a result of normal birthing practices, based on two articles he had consulted, one involving three cases of labral tear following childbirth, the other ten. In the first article, two of the three women involved had reported hip and groin pain during pregnancy, and in the second, three of the ten reported pain after vaginal delivery, and four of the ten recalled a specific forceful event like a well-meaning helper pulling her ankle outward during delivery. This is a sufficiently weak scientific foundation that I view the possibility that a labrum can tear during normal delivery as theoretically possible, but unlikely in this case\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  Dr. Gilbart states that labral tears are not commonly suffered during childbirth, and he has not seen it happen in his practice, during which he has seen 1,800 labral tears associated with other pathology. Dr. Sun, Ms. Nelson's family doctor until 2013, had not seen a labral tear from vaginal delivery since she started her practice in 1989\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  I find that Ms. Nelson's labrum was not torn before she went into the defendant hospital to deliver her baby. I accept that she had no symptoms consistent with a torn labrum before childbirth, and that the labrum was torn during Ms. Nelson's labour and delivery at B.C. Women's Hospital\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  That leads to the issue whether Ms. Nelson's labrum was torn as a result of her leg dropping while she was under Ms. Tucker's care. Dr. Gilbart's opinion is that it was, based in part on the temporal relationship between the leg drop, as Ms. Nelson described it to him, and the onset of left hip pain. As Ms. Nelson's description included that her leg had dropped from the top of a birthing bar, Dr. Gilbart's opinion is also based in part on that assumption\n",

He assumes that Ms. Nelson's labrum was normal before she went into the hospital, and says the forces generated if Ms. Nelson's leg had been allowed to fall from a frog-leg position would not be sufficient to tear a normal labrum. He discounts, at least in his first written opinion, the possibility that Ms. Nelson's left foot or ankle fell from the top of a birthing bar because, as he states in that opinion, \"The engineering report indicates that it would not be possible for the legs to have been upon the birthing bar as described by Ms. Nelson.\n",

      "... a forcible tearing of a joint with partial rupturing or other injury to its attaching ligaments.

The defendants start with entries in various caregivers' charts, made after the birth and alleged injury, which merely describe her protracted labour and forceps-assisted delivery. An example is in a consultation letter from Dr. Taunton to Dr. Sun, where Dr. Taunton states, \"... a very complicated labour with low forceps delivery. Immediately she had anterior and lateral left hip pain with progressive pain over the symphysis,\" or Dr. Sun's March 15, 2010, referral letter to Dr. Gilbart, in which Dr. Sun said that Ms. Nelson had a low forceps delivery.

      "48  The defendants argue such references indicate that Ms. Nelson initially related the onset of her left hip pain to her difficult labour and low forceps delivery, and that remained her explanation until her disability benefits were either refused or terminated and she found herself having to appeal that decision\n",

      "51  The defendants argue that for some time it seemed to be Ms. Nelson's theory that her leg was dropped while she was in what has been referred to as a frog-leg position. This is the position assumed by Dr. McGraw in the quote set out above, and is mentioned directly or inferentially in several of the clinical records produced at trial. The defendants point to the Notice of Civil Claim, where at paragraphs 7 and 8 Ms. Nelson pleads:\n",
      "While in labour and under the effects of the epidural anaesthetic, the Plaintiff was positioned on her back with her hips flexed and externally rotated, in a \"frog-leg\" position, by the Defendant Nurse Doe, with the Defendant Nurse Doe holding the Plaintiff's left leg and the Plaintiff's partner holding her right leg and the Plaintiff was instructed to continue pushing, which she did.\n",
      "While the Plaintiff was in the \"frog-leg\" position referred to in paragraph 7 above, the Defendant Nurse Doe turned and started away from the Plaintiff's bedside, letting go of the Plaintiff's left leg. As the Plaintiff was under the effects of the epidural anaesthetic, the Plaintiff's left leg dropped from the frog-leg position in an uncontrolled \"dead weight\" motion (the \"Drop\")\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "52  The defendants say this pleading shows a step in the evolution in the plaintiff's explanation of the cause of her hip injury, from a complicated and prolonged second stage of labour culminating in a forceps-assisted delivery to a drop of the left leg from the frog-leg position. The defendants also argue that, by frog's legs, the plaintiff means the position more officially known as the McRoberts position. Finally, the defendants argue that the pleading illustrates Ms. Nelson's lack of consistency over time, and her lack of credibility\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "53  The evidence revealed a range in what witnesses meant or understood by frog-leg as a position employed during labour and delivery. At one end of the range is the McRoberts position, in which the birth mother's hips are flexed so that her knees are drawn up close to her chest, or, as described by the witness Ms. Stahl, where the patient is on her back with her legs up on either side of her body or as far back as she can get them. That generally corresponds with Dr. McGraw's understanding of the frog-leg position, based on an explanation given to him by nurses at B.C. Women's Hospital while he was investigating for his written opinion. Ms. Nelson was not in this position until after Ms. Tucker went off shift, as described by Dr. Beaudoin and as recorded in the hospital chart\n",

In her evidence in chief she referred to it as having her knees out a bit, and she referred to her the position of her legs position shown in some photos taken when she went back to the defendant hospital to inspect birthing beds, and took the opportunity to re-enact having her feet and ankles on a birthing bar. At trial she referred to this as a frog's legs position. Those photos show Ms. Nelson's elevated legs slightly bent at the knee and slightly flexed at the hip, but her knees are nowhere near her chest. This is not far off the description given by Dr. Mangat, who has been Ms. Nelson's family doctor since August 2012. When he was asked what he understood the \"frog position\" to mean, he answered that the patient was supine on her back with her knees slightly flexed and rotated\n",

      "The credibility of interested witness, particularly in cases of conflict of evidence, cannot be gauged solely by the test of whether the personal demeanour of the particular witness carried conviction of the truth. The test must reasonably subject his story to an examination of its consistency with the probabilities that surround the currently existing conditions. In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions. Only thus can a Court satisfactorily appraise the testimony of quick-minded, experienced and confident witnesses, and of those shrewd persons adept in the half-lie and of long and successful experience in combining skilful exaggeration with partial suppression of the truth. Again a witness may testify what he sincerely believes to be true, but he may be quite honestly mistaken. For a trial Judge to say \"I believe him because I judge him to be telling the truth\", is to come to a conclusion on consideration of only half the problem. In truth it may easily be self-direction of a dangerous kind.\n",
      "The trial Judge ought to go further and say that evidence of the witness he believes is in accordance with the preponderance of probabilities in the case and, if his view is to command confidence, also state his reasons for that conclusion. The law does not clothe the trial Judge with a divine insight into the hearts and minds of the witnesses.

The defence argues that it was not until her examination for discovery in November 2013 that Ms. Nelson arrived at her current story, that her left leg was allowed to drop unsupported from the top of the birthing bar, as an explanation for her torn labrum.

A patient complaining of hip pain who describes her fairly recent childbirth in a way that a doctor interprets as \"complicated labour low forceps delivery,\" in Dr. Taunton's case, is not necessarily trying to tell the doctor what has caused the hip pain, or that the two were related. It is equally likely that the patient is simply presenting significant events in order to fully inform the doctor or other treatment provider. There is a risk from reading too much into the cryptic notes written by the doctor, then translated into a consultation report to a referring family doctor.

There certainly may be cases where a plaintiff's description of his or her symptoms is clearly inconsistent with a failure to seek medical attention, permitting the court to draw adverse conclusions about the plaintiff's credibility. But a plaintiff whose condition neither deteriorates nor improves is not obliged to constantly bother busy doctors with reports that nothing has changed, particularly if the plaintiff has no reason to expect the doctors will be able to offer any new or different treatment.

Ms. King also said that matters such as failing to record sensory and motor levels after the 5:15 a.m. bolus epidural administration were problematic.

Ms. Tucker was not aware that she might be called on to answer questions about that particular labour until sometime in 2012, the same year she left B.C. Women's Hospital to work as a public health nurse.

      "... to offer an objective nursing opinion, for the assistance of the court, on whether or not the nursing care provided to Ms. Nelson and her expectant child at British Columbia Women's Hospital and Health Centre met the expected standards of Obstetrical care for the year of 2009.\n",
      "Quite apart from the broad generality of this instruction is whether this or any witness should be so directly addressing the ultimate issue. Counsel provided a joint written submission that generally argued that the so-called ultimate issue rule was no longer a rule of general application, citing Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 4th ed. (Markham, Butterworths, 2014 at p. 830), where the statement appears, \"[t]here is no longer a general rule barring opinion evidence on the ultimate issue.\" I note that the next sentence in the text reads: \"There remains a concern that experts should not be able to usurp the functions of the trier of fact,\" and that the paragraph ends with this: \"In R. v. J. (J.-L.), , the Supreme Court of Canada endorsed the principle that as the expert opinion approaches an ultimate issue in a dispute, the trial judge should exercise special scrutiny.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "88  That there may not be much left of the ultimate issue rule, if there was such a rule, was discussed by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Graat, , where the court accepted Wigmore's description of the rule as unsound historically and in principle, and quoted Professor Cross as saying, \"The exclusion of opinion evidence on the ultimate issue can easily become something of a fetish.\n",

But its weight is reduced because Ms. King states \"The facts on which my opinion is based have been extracted from a review of the documents listed below,\" whereupon she lists documents that include the Notice of Civil Claim, the Response to Civil Claim and transcripts from the examination for discovery of the defendant Tucker and of Ms. Basso, who was examined as a representative of the defendant Provincial Health Services Authority, and who did not testify. This court has previously remarked on the propriety of turning an expert loose, unsupervised, in discovery transcripts in Croutch (Guardian ad litem of) v. B.C. Women's Hospital, , where Lowry J., then a judge of this court said at paras. 16-17:\n",
      "[16] Here some of the statements of the opinions adduced in support of the plaintiff's case are in large measure deficient because they do not state clearly the facts upon which the opinions were based. The plaintiff's experts were given all of the transcripts of discovery conducted on both sides and the clinical documentation. They apparently based their opinions on their own interpretation of the evidence. One expert who had read the discoveries but whose statement disclosed absolutely none of the facts assumed, was actually asked during the trial to prepare a statement of the facts on which he based his opinion. No objection to the admissibility of any of the plaintiff's expert evidence was taken, but much of the cross-examination had to be directed to ascertaining the factual basis assumed.\n",
      "[17] In my view, expert witnesses should not base their opinions on discovery evidence which may or may not be read in at trial. Indeed, as a general rule, I do not consider they should be given access to discovery transcripts. The assessment of evidence is not their function, and there is no place for the delivery of an expert's opinion when it is based on facts drawn by the expert from what was said on discovery. The facts underlying an opinion are within the purview of counsel. It is counsel who must be satisfied they are facts that can be proven, and it is for counsel to settle with an expert witness the facts that are to be assumed for the purpose of the opinion. It is those facts that must then be set out clearly in the statement that is to be delivered in compliance with the Rules\n",

      "91  The evidence of Ms. Mason and Ms. Hastings satisfies me that it is not unusual that a labouring woman's feet are placed on top of a birthing bar during rest periods between contractions at B.C. Women's Hospital, and Ms. Stahl's evidence confirms that in her experience this is routine, albeit outside of B.C. Women's Hospital. B.C.

She was less definite in her answer at discovery, she had little experience with birthing bars at the time, and there does not seem to be any sensible reason why a woman's feet should not be rested on top of the bar, so long as the risk of hypertension is reduced by elevating her head. The evidence of the witnesses Mason and Hastings shows that such things are done at B.C. Women's Hospital. As a rest position, there does not seem to be any real risk, so long as support is provided for patients whose ability to control their legs has been affected by epidural medications\n",

      "93  I also accept that because Ms. Nelson felt nothing when her leg dropped, she did not attach any significance to the leg drop, at the time or for some time later, and so she could reasonably be excused from mentioning it to treatment providers. It was reasonable for her to believe at first that her pain was a natural result of a difficult first delivery by a 39-year-old. That she was slow to recall the involvement of the birthing bar is also understandable; that her leg was allowed to drop was the important fact; what it dropped from would have been less significant\n",

      "94  Dr. Beaudoin's evidence is important here. He testified that he saw Ms. Tucker place Ms. Nelson's left foot or ankle on top of the birthing bar and he copied her. I believe him. If he had been prepared to fabricate this evidence to help his wife, there is no apparent reason he would not go further, to claim that he saw the leg drop incident itself, but he did not. I found him a careful witness, obviously supportive of his wife, but not so sympathetic to her cause that he would either exaggerate or prevaricate\n",

      "95  While Ms. Tucker did not breach any duty she owed to Ms. Nelson when she placed Ms. Nelson's left foot on the birthing bar, she did breach a duty when she let go of the foot or leg, removing the support she had been providing, allowing the leg to drop. Ms. Tucker knew that Ms. Nelson had little or no control over her own leg at the time, so would not be able to affect the rate or direction of its fall, and it was foreseeable that some sort of injury would occur if a leg were allowed to fall in such circumstances\n",

      "96  Although I have already found that Ms. Nelson's labrum tore during her labour and delivery, that does not mean that the causal connection between Ms. Tucker's breach of duty and the torn labrum is automatically established. There is evidence raising the possibility that Ms. Nelson's labrum tore naturally, as a result of normal forces experienced in childbirth, so I must still determine whether the plaintiff has proved on a balance of probabilities that the breach caused injury\n",

      "======\n",

      "Tears of the labrum can occur on an acute or chronic basis. Athletes participating in sports such as soccer, skating, hockey, tennis and golf present with an acute tear due to axial loading, rotation, and hyperextension. Alternatively, patients may present with a degenerative tear, having had intermittent symptoms of pain and clicking for months to years.\n",
      "He continues:\n",
      "If one assumes that the preoperative condition of the left acetabular labrum was normal, the force required to cause the change as seen in the MRI study and confirmed at surgery, in the writer's view would have to have been significant. In the writer's view, for a de novo tear of the acetabular labrum, there would have to be the usual forces of axial-loading (weight bearing), rotation and possible hyperextension.\n",
      "In the writer's view, these forces would not be consistent with those that are proposed with the injury. The legs were elevated (hip flexed), knee presumably slightly flexed and leg abducted away from the body. It is suggested that the leg was dropped from this position onto the bed. In the writer's view this event is inconsistent with the pathology of labral tear described.\n",
      "The engineering report indicates that it would not be possible for the legs to have been upon the birthing bar as described by Ms. Nelson:\n",
      "The birthing position, with one leg held by the husband and one leg held by the nurse in the frog-leg position, would be consistent with current obstetrical practice. The writer is of the view that if the leg were allowed to descend from this position to the bed unrestricted, it would not be of sufficient shearing force to result in a de novo tear of the acetabular labrum\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "100  As stated earlier, the engineering report referred to is not in evidence. Dr. McGraw testified that he did not rely on it.

      "\n",
      "101  Dr. McGraw testified that the frog-leg birthing position he referred to was \"... the patient on the back with the legs spread apart and widened out, and leg -- feet turned out and knees pulled up to the chest.\" He said he believed that to be a customary or standard position because of something he learned during a visit he made to B.C. Women's Hospital as part of his investigations before he wrote his report.

Women's Hospital. He testified, \"Then it became clear to me as to what I think happened,\" to which he added, \"And her -- her description to me was that the birthing bar was not used in that manner,\" from which I take it that what the head nurse had told him was inconsistent with Ms. Nelson's description of how the birthing bar was used. Dr. McGraw also said in cross-examination that from what he understood of the distance involved, dropping a leg from the frog-leg position he would not consider injurious to the patient\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "103  I place less weight on Dr. McGraw's opinion because I have very little evidence about the demonstration given by the head nurse, or the conversations Dr. McGraw had during the demonstration, and because his understanding of the frog-leg position, taken from his discussion with the head nurse, is not the position I have found Ms. Nelson's left leg was in when it dropped. Additionally, by conducting his own investigation, Dr. McGraw has made it very difficult to determine what facts or assumptions he relied on in forming his opinions\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "104  As well, Dr. McGraw appears to stray into the field of obstetrics when he opines that the frog-leg birthing position, as he understood it from his conversation with the head nurse, would be consistent with current obstetrical practice, and when he opines that dropping the leg would not constitute a breach of the standard of care, he delves into the ultimate issue from a nursing perspective rather than the field of orthopaedics in which he is an undoubted authority. In so doing, Dr. McGraw introduces a taint of advocacy into his evidence\n",

      "106  But that does not end the inquiry because, during his arthroscopic examination of Ms. Nelson's left hip, Dr. Gilbart observed, in addition to the torn labrum, cartilage softening indicative of some early degenerative change, or mild focal osteoarthritis, on Ms. Nelson's acetabulum or hip socket. He also found moderate inflammation throughout her hip. In his opinion, the sources of Ms. Nelson's pain are as follows:\n",
      "It is possible that once the labrum has been torn, despite it being repaired the hip still is persistently painful. It is probable that some of Ms. Nelson's pain is also emanating from the small area of articular cartilage damage on the acetabulum that was noted at the time of the hip arthroscopy surgery. It is also probable that some of her pain is coming from some ongoing inflammation, or synovitis within the hip. She probably also has some pain in the extra-articular soft tissues surrounding the left hip[.\n",

      "107  Of the four sources of pain listed by Dr. Gilbart, I find on his evidence that at least the torn labrum and what he describes as \"the extra-articular soft tissue injuries surrounding the left hip\" were directly caused by the leg drop\n",

      "109  FAI can be associated with degenerative arthritis in the hip. Dr. McGraw described a circumstance where the action of running repeatedly flexes the hip, causing repetitive abutment of the overhanging acetabulum against the femoral head, which leads to wear and tear damage to the labrum on the edge of the acetabulum, signalling the beginning of cartilage changes in the femoral head\n",

      "110  The defendants point to Ms. Nelson's athletic and recreational activities before childbirth to argue that she had probably caused similar wear and tear damage to her labrum, which in turn caused the development of the mild focal osteoarthritis in her hip. It is true that Ms. Nelson was quite active before her daughter was born. She ran for an hour at a time, three to five times a week, she hiked, danced, and as well describes her job as requiring a great deal of walking and standing\n",

Instead he described partial detachment and partial thickness tearing. Dr. Gilbart also noted normal articular cartilage on the head of Ms. Nelson's femur, which does not appear logically consistent with wear and tear damage leading to the start of osteoarthritis. As well, Dr. Gilbart resisted the suggestion put to him in cross-examination that degeneration is common in cases of FAI with labral hip tears in this exchange:\n",
      "When you're treating cases of FAI with labral hip tears with no history of trauma, is it also common to see that degeneration has already set in?\n",

It is probable that this is causing some of her left hip pain, and will continue to cause some of her pain in the future.\n",

Ms. Nelson would pick them up at a shipper and deliver them to hospitals in the Lower Mainland. When surgery was scheduled, she would go to the hospital, ensure that the equipment needed for the surgery was in order, and then attend in the operating room to assist the surgeon and nursing staff in the selection of the pieces of equipment needed.

      "41  In Nason, Russell J. stated:\n",
      "[53] It follows that the real force of the plaintiff's argument in favour of negligence comes from authorities that assert that a presumption of negligence arises if a driver's car leaves the roadway. I agree with the defendant that the appropriate treatment of this presumption is as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Fontaine v. British Columbia (Official Administrator), , . In that case, which involved a motor vehicle accident, the Court clarified that the maxim of res ipsa loquitur should be treated as expired (at para. 26-27). Rather, the trier of fact should weigh the circumstantial evidence with the direct evidence to determine whether the plaintiff has established on a balance of probabilities a prima facie case of negligence. If the plaintiff does so, then the defendant must present evidence negating that of the plaintiff, or the plaintiff must necessarily succeed (at para. 27). The Court clarified that whether an inference of negligence can be drawn from circumstantial evidence is highly dependent on the facts of each case (at para. 20, 35), and that the strength of the explanation the defendant must provide will vary in accordance with the strength of the inference sought to be drawn by the plaintiff (at para. 24).\n",
      ". . .\n",
      "[55] In the case at bar, I have concluded that the plaintiffs have failed to prove that Nunes was negligent. The plaintiffs cannot rely on the presumption of negligence to shift the onus of disproving negligence onto Nunes. In any case, I am satisfied that Nunes has demonstrated that he drove with all reasonable care, and that any presumption of negligence is rebutted by the fact that the loss of control was initiated by the rear wheels of the truck hitting the bump between the road surface and the bridge. As stated by Boyle L.J.S.C. referring to black ice in Loy v. Deacon, , 1985 CarswellBC 1412 at para. 18 (S.C.) (eC), \"[v]arious normal, non-negligent factors - braking, accelerating, turning - can cause skidding in these conditions.\" I am satisfied that striking a bump which caused the rear wheels to lose traction is a sufficient non-negligent explanation for why the truck began to fishtail.\n",
      "[56] Not all accidents will necessarily arise because of negligence: see Phillips v. Lyle,  at para. 5 (C.A.); Durant v. Lennard, , supra, at para. 15, per Southin J.A., dissenting in the result. Further, where defendants take all reasonable precautions in the circumstances, they will not be held liable in negligence: see e.g. McIntosh v. I.C.B.C. ,  (where the defendant was aware of the risk of encountering slippery sections or animals on the highway, but, not having encountered either for 170 kilometres, had taken all reasonable precautions in the circumstances); Loy v. Deacon, supra (driver not negligent in skidding on black ice, and mistaken reaction by turning wheels in wrong direction of car not negligent); Breen v. McKenzie,  (S.C.) (plaintiff not noticing anything wrong with defendant's driving, vehicle mechanically sound and having all season tires and winter radials on the rear tires, driver not found negligent); and Goodwin v. Goodwin,  (a case very similar to the one at bar where the defendant driver was not found negligent when his car went off the road after unexpectedly encountering a patch of ice; the driver had slowed to 30 km/h and had not experienced any slippage until reaching the point where he lost control of the vehicle).\n",
      "[57] Here, the evidence suggests that the defendant took all reasonable precautions to avoid losing traction: he was using all season tires, he had weight over the rear wheels of the pickup, he had slowed his speed coming down the hill, and the plaintiffs themselves had no concerns with the way he was driving. There is no evidence that greater precautions, such as using snow tires or driving even more slowly, would have been advisable when the air temperature in Osoyoos was above freezing. Further, there is no evidence that such further precautions would have prevented the MVA. Therefore, I find that the plaintiffs have not proven that Nunes failed to meet the required standard of care in all of the circumstances.\n",

      "The defendant is liable for the injuries caused, even if they are extreme, but need not compensate the plaintiff for any debilitating effects of the pre-existing condition which the plaintiff would have experienced anyway. The defendant is liable for the additional damage but not for the pre-existing damage. ... Likewise, if there is a measurable risk that the pre-existing condition would have detrimentally affected the plaintiff in the future, regardless of the defendant's negligence, then this can be taken into account in reducing the overall award. ... This is consistent with the general rule that the plaintiff must be returned to the position he would have been in, with all of its attendant risks and shortcomings, and not a better position.\n",

      "[95] A claim for loss of future earning capacity raises two key questions:\n",
      "has the plaintiff's earning capacity been impaired by his or her injuries; and, if so,\n",
      "what compensation should be awarded for the resulting financial harm that will accrue over time?\n",
      "[96] The assessment of loss must be based on the evidence and is a matter of judgment. It is not an application of a purely mathematical calculation. The appropriate means of assessment will vary from case to case: Brown v. Golaiy  (S.C.); Pallos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia  (C.A.); Pett v. Pett, ; Rosvold v. Dunlop, .\n",
      "[97] The essential task of the court is to compare the \"likely future of the plaintiff if the accident had not happened and the plaintiff's likely future after the accident has happened\": Gregory v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia,  at para. 32. I also note that \"insofar as is possible, the plaintiff should be put in the position he or she would have been in if not for the injuries caused by the defendant's negligence\": Lines v. W & D Logging Co. Ltd.,  at para. 185.\n",
      "[98] The principles that apply in assessing loss of future earning capacity were summarized by Low J.A. in Reilly v. Lynn,  at para. 101:\n",
      "The relevant principles may be briefly summarized. The standard of proof in relation to future events is simple probability, not the balance of probabilities, and hypothetical events are to be given weight according to their relative likelihood: Athey v. Leonati,  at para. 27. A plaintiff is entitled to compensation for real and substantial possibilities of loss, which are to be quantified by estimating the chance of the loss occurring: Athey v. Leonati, supra, at para. 27, Steenblok v. Funk  at 135 (C.A.). The valuation of the loss of earning capacity may involve a comparison of what the plaintiff would probably have earned but for the accident with what he will probably earn in his injured condition: Milina v. Bartsch  at 93 (S.C.). However, that is not the end of the inquiry; the overall fairness and reasonableness of the award must be considered: Rosvold v. Dunlop, ...  at para. 11; Ryder v. Paquette,  (C.A.). Moreover, the task of the Court is to assess the losses, not to calculate them mathematically: Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate  (C.A.). Finally, since the course of future events is unknown, allowance must be made for the contingency that the assumptions upon which the award is based may prove to be wrong: Milina v. Bartsch, supra, at 79. ...\n",
      "[99] The test is set out in Perren v. Lalari, , at para. 32:\n",
      "A plaintiff must always prove, as was noted by Donald J.A. in Steward, , by Bauman J. in Chang, , and by Tysoe J.A. in Romanchych, , that there is a real and substantial possibility of a future event leading to an income loss. If the plaintiff discharges that burden of proof, then depending upon the facts of the case, the plaintiff may prove the quantification of that loss of earning capacity, either on an earnings approach, as in Steenblok, or a capital asset approach, as in Brown. The former approach will be more useful when the loss is more easily measurable, as it was in Steenblok. The latter approach will be more useful when the loss is not as easily measurable, as in Pallos and Romanchych. A plaintiff may indeed be able to prove that there is a substantial possibility of a future loss of income despite having returned to his or her usual employment. That was the case in both Pallos and Parypa, . But, as Donald J.A. said in Steward, an inability to perform an occupation that is not a realistic alternative occupation is not proof of a future loss. [Emphasis in original.]\n",
      "[100] There are two possible approaches to assessment of loss of future earning capacity: the \"earnings approach\" discussed in Steenblok v. Funk  (C.A.); and the \"capital asset approach\" discussed in Brown. As noted in the above quote from Perren, both approaches are correct and will be more or less appropriate depending on whether the loss in question can be quantified in a measurable way: at para. 32\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  The plaintiff's position is that using the income loss multiplier of the economist Mark Gosling, an estimated present value of income loss of $6,000-$8,000 per year to age 80 ranges between approximately $45,000 and $60,000. Using the same multiplier to age 85 provides a range of approximately $60,000-$81,500. Accordingly, the plaintiff submits an appropriate award is $55,000\n",

      "Cost of Future Car\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  In Erickson v. Sibble, , Madam Justice Ballance summarized the principles that apply to a claim for damages for cost of future care:\n",
      "[316] The purpose of awarding damages for the cost of future care is to compensate for a financial loss reasonably incurred to sustain or promote the mental and/or physical health of an injured plaintiff. The cost must be justified as reasonable in the sense of being medically required or justified, and in the sense that the plaintiff will be likely to incur them based on the evidence. In Kuskis v. Tin, , the Court summarized the relevant principles in relation to a claim for cost of future care at paras. 163-164:\n",
      "An award for the cost of future care is notional and imprecise in nature: Strachan (Guardian ad Litem of) v. Reynolds, . The court must consider evidence regarding what care is likely in the injured person's best interest and calculate its present cost, with appropriate adjustment for contingencies in all of the circumstances of the case: Courdin v. Meyers, .\n",
      "In making an award for future care costs the court must take into account both what is medically required and what expenses the plaintiff will likely incur. Items and services that the plaintiff is unlikely to use in the future cannot be justified as reasonably necessary aspects of the cost of future care: Izony v. Weidlich, .\n",
      "(See also, Krangle (Guardian ad litem of) v. Brisco, .)\n",
      "[317] Recommendations made by a medical doctor or made by various other health care professionals are relevant in determining whether an item or service is medically justified: Gregory at para. 38.\n",
      "[318] Dr. Bradford obliquely recommended some sort of rehabilitation to help improve Ms. Erickson's back pain and soft tissue injuries. She qualified her advice by saying that such rehabilitation would have to wait until Ms. Erickson's hip and wrist problems had been resolved. Dr. Bradford's recommendation and the evidence at large falls short of demonstrating that an unspecified rehabilitation program relative to Ms. Erickson's low back is reasonably necessary to preserve her health within the meaning of the authorities: see, for example, Milina v. Bartsch  (S.C.), aff'd  (C.A.); Penner v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, ; Gregory\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  In Simmavong v. Haddock, Greyell J. also summarized the applicable principles including the issue of contingencies:\n",
      "[125] In his text The Law of Damages, loose-leaf ed. (Toronto: Canada Law Book, updated November 2011, release 20), Professor Waddams states, at 3-63:\n",
      ". . . the tenor of Dickson J.'s judgment in Andrews v. Grand & Toy, , makes it clear that the court will lean in favour of the plaintiff in judging the reasonableness of his claim. The court made it plain that the restraint imposed on damages for non-pecuniary losses was an added reason for insuring the adequacy of pecuniary compensation.\n",
      "[126] The test for determining the appropriate award under the heading of cost of future care is an objective one based on medical evidence. For an award of future care: (1) there must be a medical justification; and (2) the claims must be reasonable: Milina, at 84. Furthermore, future care costs must be likely to be incurred by the plaintiff. The award of damages is thus a matter of prediction as to what will happen in future. If a plaintiff has not used a particular item or service in the past it may be inappropriate to include its cost in a future care award: Izony v. Weidlich,  at para. 74.\n",
      "[127] Contingencies must also be considered when assessing cost of future care. In Gilbert, , the court discussed adjusting for contingencies at para. 253:\n",
      "The extent, if any, to which a future care costs award should be adjusted for contingencies depends on the specific care needs of the plaintiff. In some cases negative contingencies are offset by positive contingencies and, therefore, a contingency adjustment is not required: see Spehar (Guardian ad litem of), . In other cases, however, the award is reduced based on the prospect of improvement in the plaintiff's condition or increased based on the prospect that additional care will be required: see Morrison (Committee of), . Each case falls to be determined on its particular facts.\n",
      "[128] An assessment of damages for cost of future care is not a precise accounting exercise: Krangle (Guardian ad litem of) v. Brisco,  at para. 21\n",

      "86  The plaintiff's position is that damages should be awarded in accordance with the recommendations of Ms. Taylor as set out in her cost of future care analysis.

      "88  The defendants' position is that Ms. Taylor has prepared a report that does not accord with the plaintiff's actual needs.

      "1  This action arises out of the tragedy associated with the birth of Mirella Rochelle Steinebach (\"Mirella\"). Mirella, who is now five years of age, suffers from severe or profound cerebral palsy caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy which, in lay terms, is damage to or destruction of brain tissue occasioned by oxygen deprivation. In this instance, the encephalopathy is attributed to a complete placental abruption or separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus, which occurred sometime before Mirella's birth on March 31, 2005. The abruption terminated the supply of oxygen to the brain by way of the placenta and the fetal circulatory system. The question is whether the harm associated with the abruption would have been avoided, but for the alleged negligence of one or more medical professionals\n",

She says that the nurses and the doctor failed to properly consider signs indicating the onset of an abruption, the need to consult an obstetrician upon admission to the Hospital, the need to intensely monitor the health of the fetus during labour, and the need to be prepared for immediate intervention that would have resulted in Mirella's delivery before harm resulted from a complete abruption\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "3  The need for more attentive care than that alleged to have been provided is said to arise from a constellation of factors: a large \"gush of blood\" at home described by Ms. Steinebach in a telephone call to the Hospital which prompted a nurse in the birthing unit to advise Ms. Steinebach to get to the Hospital as soon as possible; Ms. Steinebach's low weight gain in the course of the pregnancy; symphysis fundal height that did not correspond to gestational age; a low amniotic fluid index; and the fact that Ms. Steinebach was Group B Streptococcus (\"GBS\") positive and a gestational diabetic\n",

She says that if the medical team had properly assessed her and the fetus, an obstetrician would have been consulted immediately upon Ms. Steinebach's admission to the Hospital. The obstetrician would have implemented a management plan calling for vigilance and a low threshold for intervention. Harm to Mirella would have been prevented as she would have been delivered before the onset of the complete abruption which likely occurred shortly before Mirella's birth at 0537 hours on March 31, 2005\n",

      "17  The events giving rise to this action commenced on the evening of March 30th. Ms. Steinebach testified that she felt the onset of contractions in the early evening. She lay down to rest. When she felt the contractions getting heavier she got up. As she was walking down a hallway, she felt heavy pressure in her groin area and then she felt or observed a \"gush of blood\", which she described as bright red in colour, falling to the floor. She observed blood on her pants and her pyjamas. She testified that the amount of blood was more than she had experienced in relation to any menstrual cycle and more than a pad could hold. While she could not estimate the amount of blood she lost, she said she thought that it made a circle on the floor approximately eight inches in diameter. She said that the bleeding slowed down after the initial gush. She telephoned the Hospital, spoke to a nurse, and was advised to get to the Hospital as soon as possible\n",

      "20  Nurse LaCarte testified that she recorded the amount of bleeding as \"++\" because she was not able to get a specific volume estimate from Ms. Steinebach by reference to tablespoons, half cups, cups, or the soaking of a pad. She testified that in other situations she had recorded greater amounts of bleeding where there were no quantity estimates as \"+++\" and \"++++\". Nurse LaCarte testified that she did not consider the reported bleeding to be significant because this was Ms. Steinebach's second pregnancy and the fact that she had reported contractions throughout the day suggested to her that what Ms. Steinebach had seen at home was \"show\" which was a mixture of mucous and blood associated with dilation of the cervix rather than frank blood from an active bleed. The record reflects Nurse LaCarte's advice that Ms. Steinebach get to the Hospital as soon as she could.\n",

Nurse Appleby, the clinical resource nurse or head nurse in the unit at the time, decided that Ms. Steinebach should be taken immediately to a delivery suite because this was her second pregnancy, she might deliver quickly, she was GBS positive, and she was a gestational diabetic\n",

      "22  Nurse Hermogenes was in the delivery suite when Ms. Steinebach arrived with Nurse Appleby. Nurse Hermogenes provided Ms. Steinebach with a gown. She observed a dark brown spot of blood on the pad that Ms. Steinebach was wearing when she arrived at the Hospital. She asked Ms. Steinebach about the bleeding and was told it was \"like a gush\". She did not ask further questions about the volume of the reported bleed. She attached an external fetal heart monitor to Ms. Steinebach at 2132 hours and then left the room to attend to other duties. Nurse Appleby assessed Ms. Steinebach\n",

      "23  Nurse Appleby reviewed the antenatal record which had been compiled by the physicians who had cared for Ms. Steinebach during pregnancy and was available in the birthing unit. She testified that neither Ms. Steinebach nor her husband expressed concern about the labour and neither reported ongoing bleeding during labour. She testified that she asked Ms. Steinebach for an estimate of the amount of blood she had lost at home but none was forthcoming\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  Nurse Appleby was aware of the need to be concerned about antepartum bleeding as it could indicate the onset of an abruption. She was also aware of the risks associated with intrauterine growth restriction which could be indicated by a low level of amniotic fluid and a small fetus, and the need to treat a GBS infection by means of intravenous antibiotics. Nurse Appleby detected no bleeding in the course of a vaginal examination. She testified that when she described a mucous plug, Ms. Steinebach seemed to agree that that is what she had observed at home\n",

      "\n",
      "25  Nurse Appleby palpated the abdomen, assessed the fetal heart rate, performed a vaginal examination, and determined that Ms. Steinebach was two centimetres dilated. She testified that she was aware from the antenatal record of the low weight gain during pregnancy and the lack of the expected correlation between symphysis fundal height and gestational age. She testified that these factors did not concern her because Ms. Steinebach was a small woman who was likely carrying a small fetus. Nurse Appleby identified nothing in the course of the examination that suggested to her, from a nursing perspective, that continuous electronic monitoring was necessary, and nothing that caused her to be concerned that Ms. Steinebach had suffered a partial placental abruption at home\n",

      "26  Nurse Appleby knew of the danger associated with abruption. She was aware that given the report of bleeding at home, one could not rule out a partial abruption and had to err on the side of caution and carefully monitor the situation. She knew of the risks associated with intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios, which is an abnormally low volume of amniotic fluid, but regarded the assessment of either or both conditions to be the responsibility of a physician rather than a nurse. Likewise, she considered the classification of the risk in any pregnancy as low, moderate, or high, to be the physician's responsibility. She regarded the nurse's role to be to obtain as much information as possible to assist the physician in her or his assessment of the patient\n",

Nurse Appleby told Nurse Hermogenes that Ms. Steinebach was GBS positive, a gestational diabetic, and of low symphysis fundal height. Nurse Hermogenes tested Ms. Steinebach's blood sugar level and found it to be normal. She testified that the fundal height and Ms. Steinebach's low weight gain were not of concern to her because Ms. Steinebach was a small woman who was probably carrying a small baby. She saw no entry by a physician in the antenatal record to suggest that the fetus showed signs of intrauterine growth restriction, or that the low level of amniotic fluid suggested oligohydramnios\n",

      "28  Nurse Hermogenes examined the fetal heart monitor strip, concluded that it was reassuring, and discontinued its operation at approximately 2220 hours. She then resorted to intermittent auscultation to assess the fetus at time intervals that conformed to the accepted practice at the Hospital. She palpated the abdomen and determined that it did not seem tender to touch. She inserted an intravenous shunt in order that antibiotics could be administered to counteract the possibility of a GBS infection\n",

      "29  Dr. O'Brien, who was serving as a locum or temporary replacement for the Clinic's doctors on March 30-31, first visited Ms. Steinebach at 2250 hours. Nurse Hermogenes told her that the patient had reported a bleed at home but that there was no sign of active bleeding at the time of admission, she was GBS positive, and she was a gestational diabetic whose blood sugar level was normal. Nurse Hermogenes could not recall the amount of time the doctor spent with Ms. Steinebach but agreed that it was brief and could have been as short as five, six, or seven minutes. Nurse Hermogenes testified that Dr. O'Brien did not advise her that it was necessary to keep a careful watch over Ms. Steinebach because there might have been an abruption at home, and did not ask or instruct Nurse Hermogenes to be on the lookout for anything peculiar in the course of the labour or to notify her in the event that anything of a questionable nature was observed in the course of the labour. Nurse Hermogenes understood the labour and delivery to be low risk\n",

      "31  At approximately 0030 hours on March 31, Nurse Hermogenes detected a high fetal heart rate on intermittent auscultation. She reattached the external fetal heart monitor. Nurse Hermogenes discontinued electronic monitoring at 0115 hours because the readings on the strip again appeared normal. She resumed intermittent auscultation\n",

      "32  At 0050 hours Ms. Steinebach requested something for pain. Dr. O'Brien was consulted by telephone at 0055 hours. She provided an order permitting the use of morphine to counteract the pain. Nurse Hermogenes assessed Ms. Steinebach as two to three centimetres dilated, indicating that delivery was not imminent and it was safe to administer morphine which she did at 0100 hours\n",

      "\n",
      "33  Ms. Steinebach was assessed again at 0315 hours and found to be four to five centimetres dilated. She requested an epidural which Dr. O'Brien had earlier ordered could be administered when the patient was at least four centimetres dilated. The epidural was administered by an anaesthetist at 0415 hours. Nurse Hermogenes reattached the fetal heart monitor in accord with the usual practice in order to monitor the effect of the anaesthetic upon the fetus. She observed some decrease in the variability of the fetal heart rate which she testified was not unusual. She concluded that the fetal heart rate was recovering appropriately by 0434 hours. The electronic monitor remained operative\n",

      "34  Nurse Hermogenes performed a vaginal exam at 0430 hours. In the portion of the partogram where \"bleeding/show\" entries are to be recorded, Nurse Hermogenes made the notation \"mod\" meaning moderate. In her written notes pertaining to the assessment at 0430 hours she recorded \"show +++\" and \"rim\". She explained that the entry meant \"there was a little - a little bit more show and she was a rim. A rim means about nine centimetres and full dilatation is ten.\" Nurse Hermogenes testified that she was sure that she saw \"show\" as opposed to frank or free blood at 0430 hours, and that the show was not abnormal in amount. Nurse Hermogenes inserted a catheter to drain urine in order that the head of the fetus would descend in the birth canal more quickly\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  The partogram indicates that the external fetal heart monitor recorded a rate of 132, 140, 147 and 140 beats per minute at 0415, 0430, 0445 and 0500 hours, respectively. The quality of the tracing decreased commencing at 0455 hours when there was a loss of contact. Nurse Hermogenes turned Ms. Steinebach on her side in an effort to restore contact. Contact did not improve. Ms. Steinebach was turned back. The last external monitor reading recorded in the partogram is that entered at 0500 hours. The tracing or strip becomes increasingly non-interpretable from and after 0510 hours. No intermittent auscultation entries are recorded in the partogram between 0500 and 0520 hours. The entries recorded at 0520, 0525, and 0530 hours reflect 130, 123 and 126 beats per minute, respectively\n",

      "\n",
      "36  In the course of direct examination, Nurse Hermogenes was asked what meaning she attributed to the strip recording the fetal heat rate at 0453 and 0455 hours. She responded as follows:\n",
      "I see an acceleration with a contraction and it's slowly going down to the baseline again and there's two little dips there which is a little variability decel, but they're not even long enough to be classified as a variable decel and it's going back up again to - for an acceleration to almost 160\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  Nurse Hermogenes was not asked, in direct or cross examination, whether she actually observed the readings to which she was being referred in her evidence at the times indicated on the strip whereupon she formed her opinion, or whether she was interpreting the strip retrospectively\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  The next physical examination of Ms. Steinebach after 0430 hours occurred 40 minutes later at 0510 hours. Nurse Hermogenes recorded the following in the partogram:\n",

      "39  Nurse Hermogenes testified that she monitored the fetal heart by intermittent auscultation every five minutes when Ms. Steinebach was instructed to begin pushing marking the onset of the second stage of labour at 0510 hours. As I have remarked, the last recorded electronic readout was recorded in the partogram at 0500 hours. The first recorded intermittent auscultation entry is that at 0520 hours\n",

      "40  Nurse Hermogenes called Dr. O'Brien at 0515 hours to attend for delivery. No sense of urgency was communicated to the doctor. The partogram indicates that Dr. O'Brien arrived at the delivery suite at 0530 hours. The catheter was removed. Dr. O'Brien ruptured Ms. Steinebach's membranes at 0532 hours. According to the partogram the amniotic fluid was clear and showed no blood\n",

It was obvious to those in attendance that the newborn was compromised. A paediatrician was called to the delivery suite. Efforts ensued in an attempt to stabilize Mirella. It was obvious to Dr. O'Brien and others in attendance at the delivery that Ms. Steinebach had suffered a complete placental abruption. Mirella was soon transferred to British Columbia's Children's Hospital for assessment, treatment, and care of the cerebral palsy from which she suffers as a consequence of the complete abruption.\n",

Ramji, . Counsel made a substantially similar submission before H. Holmes J. in Ediger (Guardian ad litem of) v. Johnston, . In a fully considered and thorough discussion at paras. 189-214, the learned trial judge concluded that Paxton did not necessitate reconsideration of the principle that a fetus is owed a duty of care which crystallizes at birth.

      "45  At March 30, 2005, Dr. O'Brien was working as a locum for physicians in the Surrey Pre-Natal Clinic practice group. She completed her residency in family practice in 2004. In the approximate nine months thereafter to March 30, 2005, she was involved in an estimated 75 to 100 deliveries. She testified that in that time frame and on one or more occasions, she was involved with the management of a suspected abruption indicated by a decline in the fetal heart rate. In those instances, the babies appear to have been delivered safely by caesarean section performed by an obstetrician\n",
      "======\n",

      "46  Dr. O'Brien testified that she had a low threshold for consultation with an obstetrician. She testified that as a result of considering the information that was available to her and her physical assessment of Ms. Steinebach, she ruled out an abruption and intrauterine growth restriction, and exercising her clinical judgment, concluded that Ms. Steinebach would experience a normal labour and delivery. Ms. Steinebach claims that Dr. O'Brien did not assess and manage Ms. Steinebach's labour and delivery in a manner that met the requisite standard of care\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "47  Dr. O'Brien testified that she was aware that it was necessary to consider risk factors in the context of any pregnancy. She agreed that in this case the risk factors were the fact that Ms. Steinebach was over 35 years of age; she was small in stature; her weight gain during pregnancy was below average; she had lost weight in the week preceding the onset of labour; the amniotic fluid level was low; symphysis fundal height did not correspond to gestational age; she was GBS positive and a gestational diabetic; and she had reported an antepartum bleed in conjunction with contractions. While space is provided in Ms. Steinebach's antenatal chart, available in the birthing unit, for a physician to record relevant risk factors, none were noted by physicians who had assessed Ms. Steinebach prior to her admission to the Hospital on March 30\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  At issue is the question of whether the evidence supports the conclusion that Dr. O'Brien failed to appropriately assess and consider the constellation of risk factors, and consequently failed to manage the labour and delivery appropriately\n",

      "\n",
      "49  Dr. O'Brien testified that she had no recollection of her actual interview and assessment of Ms. Steinebach. As a result, her testimony consisted predominantly of a description of that which she would have done in the ordinary course of caring for a mother through labour and delivery as opposed to that which she had actually had done for Ms. Steinebach and the fetus. The doctor's recollection of events as she thought they must have transpired in relation to Ms. Steinebach was informed by the notes she had compiled in relation to her assessment and care. Generally, I find it difficult to accept that Dr. O'Brien would have little or no recollection of events from March 30 to 31, given the extraordinary outcome of the labour and delivery\n",

She explained that the first few lines of the note were written before her assessment in the delivery suite and additions were made in the course of the assessment, but the entirety of the note was completed in the course of the assessment at 2250 hours.

These notes, based on the evidence of the handwriting expert which I accept, were written with a different pen from that used for other parts of the notes. If Dr. O'Brien changed pens upon entering the delivery suite, as she testified was likely the case, the information in relation to those matters must have been derived from information available in the delivery suite. The evidence persuades me, and I find, that the information was not there to be obtained\n",

      "57  Nurse Hermogenes testified that the results of the non-stress test performed on March 30 and the report of the ultrasound examination performed on March 3, were not in the delivery suite. I see no reason to refrain from accepting that evidence. Nurse Hermogenes testified that she saw Dr. O'Brien write notes in the delivery suite. Whatever was written at the time could not include references to that in respect of which no information was available. Other evidence also undermines Dr. O'Brien's testimony that the entire note was written in the course of the initial assessment\n",

      "\n",
      "58  Dr. O'Brien testified that \"yest\" used in relation to the portion of the note pertaining to the stress test meant \"yesterday\". Because the non-stress test was performed on March 30, the note in relation to it must have been made on March 31. Dr. O'Brien explained the discrepancy in the date as a mistake, one of several to which she admitted, but I do not find it to be such\n",

Moreover, that ultrasound examination had been performed at 35 weeks, and not at 38 weeks as noted\n",
      "======\n",

      "60  The inescapable conclusion is that the note regarding the non-stress test result and the ultrasound finding was added some time after Mirella's delivery, when Dr. O'Brien had had an opportunity to review all of the material that was in fact available in relation to Ms. Steinebach's pregnancy, her labour, and the delivery. The reference to a repeat ultrasound that had been booked, but had yet to be performed, must also have been added at the same time given the juxtaposition of the note to the others which I find to have been made on March 31 after Mirella's delivery\n",

What is not evident from the note is whether Dr. O'Brien was attempting to record that which she had been told by Nurse Hermogenes as findings made by that nurse and Nurse Appleby, whether she was recording results which had been determined by her own independent examination, or whether the note is a combination of observations of examinations made by the nurses and the doctor\n",

      "66  Dr. O'Brien provided no credible explanation for the 0500 hours' note or its content. It does not reflect the result of any assessment by Dr. O'Brien, and does not reflect what happened in fact. The partogram and the evidence of Nurse Hermogenes indicate that with the exception of a request for an order permitting the administration of morphine at 0055 hours, there was no contact between the nurses and Dr. O'Brien from 2250 hours on March 30, to 0515 hours on March 31. Dr. O'Brien testified that she had been on duty since 0700 hours on March 30 and she thought it important to get some sleep, which she did in the call room not far removed from the delivery suite until 0515 hours when she was called by Nurse Hermogenes. The note at 0500 hours on March 31 appears to be an attempt to summarize that which Nurse Hermogenes told Dr. O'Brien at 0515 hours, and to retrospectively record an assessment and plan which Dr. O'Brien communicated to Nurse Hermogenes. The note does not accurately reflect what occurred in the delivery suite upon Dr. O'Brien's arrival at 0530 hours after she had been notified of Ms. Steinebach's progress.

I accept the evidence of the nurses in attendance that Dr. O'Brien sat at the foot of the bed from the time she gowned and gloved until Mirella was delivered. Had any note been made in the delivery suite just prior to delivery, there would have been no need to talk of an assessment and plan because the membranes had been ruptured, Ms. Steinebach had been pushing since 0510 hours and continued to push, and the delivery was proceeding as a spontaneous vaginal delivery. As a result, there was no need to \"expect\" that the delivery would proceed in that manner. Dr. O'Brien acknowledged that the words \"start pushing\" were in error because, at the time to which this note purportedly relates, Ms. Steinebach had been pushing for some time\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  I find that Dr. O'Brien made no note in the delivery room when she attended at 0530 hours. The evidence of the handwriting expert supports the conclusion, and I find, that the additions that were made to the note at 2250 hours and the note said to have been made at 0500 hours were made with the same pen, concurrently, and some time after Mirella's birth\n",

      "69  The next note is stated to have been recorded at 0600 hours on March 31. It is described as a delivery note. It records Dr. O'Brien's recollection of events at the delivery\n",

      "\n",
      "70  A further note appears at 0700 hours on March 31, 2005, as follows:\n",
      "- Reviewed FHR tracing\n",
      "- late decels x 2 noted - first at 0453 hrs to 130 bpm with recovery then late decel x 2 to 100 noted at 0500 hrs.\n",

      "- then pushing began and tracing contact difficul\n",

      "71  The note indicates that when Dr. O'Brien looked at the electronic monitor strip some time after Mirella's delivery, she immediately recognized that it showed late decelerations at 0453 and 0455 hours of which she had not been notified\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "72  Dr. O'Brien acknowledged that if she had been notified of the late decelerations she observed on the strip of 0453 and 0455 hours, she could have addressed the situation by rupturing the membranes, fastening a fetal scalp monitor clip, and consulting with an obstetrician. She acknowledged that rupturing the membranes may have hastened delivery as it actually did when she ruptured membranes at 0532 hours resulting in delivery five minutes later\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "73  Dr. O'Brien knew that she had a duty to assess Ms. Steinebach and the fetus having regard for the number and nature of the risks of which she was aware, which she knew could be inter-related, and which she knew could act in combination to adversely affect the outcome. The note at 2250 hours omits any reference to any consideration of low weight gain or unusual or abnormal symphysis fundal height, acknowledged as two factors of considerable concern in assessing the welfare of the fetus and whether and how it will tolerate the stress of labour and delivery. The note omits any reference to inquiries about the nature and extent of the bleed at home. I find that these factors were not appropriately or adequately considered and assessed by Dr. O'Brien\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "74  The number of errors in the notes that Dr. O'Brien did write are also of concern, indicate a lack of attention to detail, and support my finding that Dr. O'Brien did not adequately assess the condition of the fetus and the risks associated with the labour and delivery. The errors include a reference to, and purported reliance upon, an ultrasound examination performed at 38 weeks gestation when the examination had in fact been performed at 35 weeks; the reference to a call from the nurses at 0500 hours on March 31 which did not take place until 0515 hours; and a reference in Dr. O'Brien's dictated delivery note indicating that a complete blood count had been performed upon admission when none had been done. Her observation in that regard arose from her incorrect reading of the antenatal chart\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "75  In cross-examination, Dr. O'Brien testified that any concern raised by the accumulation of risk factors was offset by the assurance she derived from the ultrasound findings which simplified her assessment. The explanation is concerning. As I have found, the ultrasound report was not available to her when she assessed Ms. Steinebach. The suggestion that she relied on findings that were not available to her undermines her credibility generally and her claim that her assessment of Ms. Steinebach was thorough and appropriate\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "76  In sum, I do not accept Dr. O'Brien's evidence that she saw no reason to consult an obstetrician or to instruct attending nurses to be vigilant because her clinical judgment following assessment was that this was a low risk pregnancy. Her omission to consult an obstetrician resulted from a brief, incomplete and inadequate examination and assessment of a patient whom she had not met or treated before 2250 hours on March 30, 2005. The sub-standard assessment resulted in the failure to advert to the risks associated with the possibility of intrauterine growth restriction or a partial abruption, and the conclusion that Ms. Steinebach's would be a normal labour and delivery so that consultation with an obstetrician was not required\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "77  Ms. Steinebach tendered evidence from Dr. Mize Conner, an obstetrician practising in Washington State. The substance of Dr. Conner's evidence was that Ms. Steinebach had sustained a partial abruption at home which extended at 0430 hours. He testified to his opinion that the onset of the abruption and the constellation of risk factors to which I have referred meant that Dr. O'Brien should have obtained an obstetrical consult following her examination of Ms. Steinebach. In his opinion \"the history of bleeding immediately prior to her admission should have given rise to suspicion of placental abruption and independently would have required consultation with an obstetrician.\" Dr. Conner was of the opinion that in the circumstances, one had to be in a position to deliver expeditiously if there were signs of an extension of the abruption or fetal compromise\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "78  I do not accept Dr. Conner's opinion that Ms. Steinebach must have experienced a partial abruption on March 30 because she actively bled at home and again at 0430 hours, rather than discharging \"show\", which is a combination of blood and mucous resulting from the dilation of the cervix\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "79  No one with technical knowledge observed the discharge at home. At the time of admission, the bleeding or discharge appeared to have stopped. The signs often associated with the onset of an abruption, namely a uterus that is tender on palpation, tension in the abdomen between contractions, and a non-reassuring fetal heart rate, were not detected by Nurse Appleby or Nurse Hermogenes at the time of admission. The discussion between Nurse Appleby and Ms. Steinebach about the character of a mucous plug resulted in Ms. Steinebach appearing to agree that what she observed matched the description offered by Nurse Appleby. While the occurrence was a possibility, the onset of an abruption in the early evening of March 30 has not been proved on a balance of probabilities\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  I do not accept Dr. Conner's opinion that the abruption extended at 0430 hours at which time Nurse Hermogenes testified that she had observed significant \"show\" as opposed to frank blood. Dr. Conner was not in the delivery suite to make any observation of his own. There is no reason why Dr. Conner's conclusion that the nurse must have seen blood from an active bleed should be accepted over the actual observation of an experienced obstetrical nurse\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "81  What I do take from Dr. Conner's report is that any sign of antepartum bleeding must be taken seriously and assessed to the best of one's ability because bleeding could indicate an abruption. I also accept the medical evidence that in the ordinary course, it is difficult to diagnose an abruption or to rule it out. As a consequence, it is important to monitor a patient's situation with care when there has been a report of antepartum bleeding. As Dr. Conner stated, one had to be in a position to respond in the event that signs of fetal compromise occurred\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "82  Dr. Jerome Dansereau, an obstetrician practising in Victoria, testified on behalf of Dr. O'Brien. Dr. Dansereau testified to his observations regarding the fetal heart:\n",
      "At 04.53hr and again at 04.55hr there appears to be a probable late deceleration (called \"late\" because of their smooth shape and their late occurrence in relation to the contraction). Although this in itself is rarely of concern unless the pattern persists for several hours, it nonetheless raises the issue of stress on the fetus. However, it appears that the overall variability and baseline remained normal until Ms. Steinebach started pushing at 05.10hr.\n",
      "From 05.10hr until delivery, the fetal heart is poorly recorded on the strip and difficult to interpret. However it appears to be below baseline on several occasions, which is indicative of a certain level of stress on the fetus\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  Dr. Dansereau's opinion was premised on the assumptions that Dr. O'Brien had conducted an appropriate assessment of Ms. Steinebach at 2250 hours and, on the basis of that assessment, there was no need for an obstetrical consult. From these assumptions, Dr. Dansereau formulated his opinion that Dr. O'Brien had reasonably concluded that the possibility that there had been a placental abruption at home was unlikely; the plan for monitoring the fetus throughout the course of labour was appropriate; it was appropriate for Dr. O'Brien to rely on nurses to monitor Ms. Steinebach's condition through the night; and Dr. O'Brien took appropriate steps to deliver Mirella when she was notified by nurses at 0515 hours\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  The conclusions stated by Dr. Dansereau stem from two primary assumptions. The first was that Dr. O'Brien \"apparently did a standard clinical assessment to supplement and confirm the nursing assessment.\" The second was Dr. O'Brien's \"presumed conclusion\" that Ms. Steinebach had a small but otherwise healthy fetus and had not experienced an abruption but was in labour so that an obstetrical consult was not required. The assumptions appear to have been derived from an examination of Dr. O'Brien's chart notes which I have found to be unreliable and not supportive of a reasonable clinical assessment. The validity of the assumptions made by Dr. Dansereau is undermined as a result, as is the weight to be given to his opinion\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  Dr. Dansereau also concluded that the monitoring of the fetus was appropriate, particularly in the second stage of labour where \"EFM was used exclusively to monitor the fetal heart.\" The evidence I have accepted indicates that electronic fetal monitoring was not relied upon throughout. The tracing from the monitor became increasingly non-interpretable soon after 0500 hours. Such monitoring as did occur after 0500 hours was done by intermittent auscultation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  Finally, in relation to the delivery itself, Dr. Dansereau expressed this opinion:\n",
      "It seems that the level of stress experienced by this fetus was not appreciated by Dr. O'Brien at that time, or by the nurses attending the delivery. However, the sequence of action performed by Dr. O'Brien would have been equally appropriate for low risk babies and for babies in distress.\n",
      "Simply put, it was probably impossible for Dr. O'Brien to expedite the delivery of this infant any faster than she did\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "87  Dr. Dansereau considered the delivery technique employed by Dr. O'Brien at 0530 hours to be appropriate. There is nothing in his evidence to suggest that the same technique would not have been appropriate in the period from 0500 to 0517 hours\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "88  Dr. Howard J. Pendleton, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynaecology who practised in Vancouver and was Head of the Department of Obstetrics at BC Women's Hospital before partially retiring and directing his efforts to assisting colleagues in the province through a series of locums, also testified on behalf of Dr. O'Brien\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "89  Dr. Pendleton testified that blood loss associated with late pregnancy and early labour must be diagnosed as to volume, severity and importance. He stated that an abruption is difficult to diagnose and may be progressive. He testified to his opinion that because of the absence of the classical signs of abruption, there was no need to alert medical staff to the need for operative intervention at the time of admission\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "90  Like Dr. Dansereau, Dr. Pendleton proceeded from the premise that Dr. O'Brien independently assessed Ms. Steinebach and the fetus and was \"cognizant of the history of bleeding and the other factors associated with this pregnancy ... and on personal examination [was] reassured that the baby was healthy in the uterus and labour was progressing\" so that, at 2250 hours, there was no need to perform an urgent operative delivery. Dr. Pendleton testified that he saw nothing in the progress of the labour after 2250 hours that suggested that there was need for operative delivery\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "91  As I appreciate his evidence, Dr. Pendleton did not provide any opinion on the question of whether the vaginal delivery that was performed at 0537 hours should have been expedited or performed at an earlier stage as a consequence of fetal distress. Unlike Dr. Dansereau and Dr. O'Brien herself, Dr. Pendleton did not regard that which was portrayed on the strip at 0453 and 0455 hours to be anything but an \"entirely satisfactory trace with no evidence of significant and worsening prejudice.\" Except in the context of operative intervention, Dr. Pendleton did not express any opinion on the question of whether, in all of the circumstances that were known or should have been known to Dr. O'Brien, she should have sought an obstetrical consult at the time of assessment on March 30\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "92  Dr. Garry Feinstadt, a family practitioner whose practice includes maternal care and deliveries, testified on behalf of Ms. Steinebach and provided his opinion of Dr. O'Brien's management of Ms. Steinebach:\n",
      "In my opinion, Dr. Lock O'Brien also failed to meet the standard of care expected of a family physician practising in British Columbia in 2005. Dr. Lock O'Brien was aware of all of the risk factors outlined above. In addition she was aware of the fact that the patient had experienced significant vaginal bleeding and pressure prior to her admission to hospital.\n",
      "Antepartum hemorrhage (APH) associated with pain or pressure must raise the possibility of placental abruption, or premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. The other principal risk is that of placenta previa meaning some or all of the placental lying over the internal os of the cervix. Both of these conditions can be catastrophic for mother and baby very suddenly.\n",
      "Despite these risks Dr. Lock O'Brien took no additional precautions. In my opinion the combination of risk factors present at the time Dr. Lock O'Brien first saw Ms. Steinebach required that she obtain an immediate obstetrical consultation. In this way all of the resources such as anaesthesia, neonatology, operating room staff can be made aware of the situation and be prepared to respond very quickly.\n",
      "Dr. Lock O'Brien in fact took no additional precautions. She did not discuss the concerns with the patient or with the nursing staff. She ordered no appropriate blood work such as CBC, crossmatch and coagulation studies. She did not discuss or order continuous electronic fetal monitoring. She did not examine any of the FHR (fetal heart rate) monitoring strips herself until after the fact. She did not reassess the patient herself at any time prior to being called at 0515\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "93  Dr. Feinstadt's opinion was challenged in certain respects on cross examination but I conclude that of the experts who testified, his opinion is the most compelling with respect to the standard of care and the departure from it. It is consistent with the evidence as a whole and that which I have found to be reliable and most relevant: the fact of an antepartum bleed of uncertain etiology; a constellation of risk factors known or that should have been known by Dr. O'Brien to be such; the omission to conduct a thorough assessment of the history surrounding Ms. Steinebach and the fetus on March 30; the omission to obtain an obstetrical consult; the failure of Dr. O'Brien to return to the delivery suite from 2250 hours until 0530 hours to assess or reassess progress; and the doctor's omission to instruct the nursing staff to be extremely vigilant and to notify her immediately in the event they detected anything that might indicate fetal distress\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "94  I accept the opinion of Dr. Feinstadt, a family practitioner: the circumstances surrounding Ms. Steinebach's labour and delivery were such that Dr. O'Brien owed a duty to Ms. Steinebach to consult with an obstetrician regarding the appropriate course for the management of the labour and eventual delivery and to appropriately instruct the attending nurses\n",
      "======\n",

      "97  Nurse Appleby by-passed triage and took Ms. Steinebach directly to a delivery suite anticipating that because of the bleeding at home, of which Nurse Appleby was aware, and because this was Ms. Steinebach's second pregnancy, immediate delivery was likely. I accept Nurse Appleby's evidence that she discussed the nature and extent of the \"gush of blood\" Ms. Steinebach had experienced at home with her and that efforts to obtain helpful information from Ms. Steinebach failed\n",

      "99  On examination for discovery, Ms. Steinebach had testified that she had not previously seen the colour of blood she saw on March 30, and she had not experienced bleeding in the course of her pregnancy with Brandon except when he was delivered. On cross examination at trial, Ms. Steinebach was directed to the Hospital record of a telephone call she had made in August 2002 before being admitted to the Hospital for Brandon's delivery. The record states that Ms. Steinebach reported that she had been bleeding and the colour was bright red. Ms. Steinebach testified that she did not remember making the statement although she remembered making the call to the Hospital. She reiterated that she did not bleed in the course of her pregnancy with Brandon\n",

Her testimony was not challenged in cross examination. The statement of Ms. Steinebach on the prior occasion, which I find to have been made, is inconsistent with her testimony at the examination for discovery and at trial. The inconsistency affects my assessment of the reliability of her evidence in relation to the nature of the bleed she experienced at home on March 30, and the extent of her report to nurses at the time of admission and upon initial assessment\n",

I can find no reason why she would not have willingly informed Nurse Appleby or Nurse Hermogenes of the details to which she testified had she in fact experienced them. As a second-time mother, she must have been aware of the importance of telling her health care providers all she could about a condition which appeared to be of great concern to her in order that her condition, and that of the fetus, could be properly assessed. Equally, I can find no reason why two experienced nurses would have failed to record details as seemingly significant as estimates of the quantity of blood would appear to have been, had such estimates been provided. I find as a fact that the details to which Ms. Steinebach testified at trial regarding the extent of the bleed at home were not communicated to Nurse Appleby\n",

He also testified that upon arrival at the Hospital, a nurse gave Ms. Steinebach a gown and new pad to replace that which Ms. Steinebach was wearing and which he said was \"soaked with blood again\". He testified that Ms. Steinebach changed her pad a number of times after admission to the Hospital and on each occasion blood was evident. This latter observation is inconsistent with the testimony of nurses indicating that there were pads on the bed, but none was actually worn by Ms. Steinebach when she was in delivery suite. Mr. Steinebach testified that he assumed that the extent of the bleeding at home was more than normal and that he emphasized the extent of the bleeding to the nurses when they examined Ms. Steinebach on admission\n",

The communication which Ms. Steinebach had with the Hospital on the occasion of Brandon's delivery and her answers to questions on examination for discovery in this action compel the finding that she told Nurse Appleby no more than is in the chart: she had experienced a gush of blood at home.

She discussed the character of a mucous plug with Ms. Steinebach, a description with which Ms. Steinebach appeared to concur. Upon palpation, she was unable to detect a tender abdomen or tension in the abdomen between contractions. Nurse Appleby properly considered her obligation to be to obtain as much information from an assessment of Ms. Steinebach as possible and to ensure that her findings were conveyed to the attending physician.

Ms. Steinebach told her she had experienced a big gush of blood at home. While Nurse Hermogenes did not ask follow-up questions, she recorded that information and communicated it to Dr. O'Brien.

Diagnosis and the development of a treatment plan were Dr. O'Brien's responsibility. Similarly there is no evidence to contradict the testimony of Nurse Hermogenes that the duty to diagnose intrauterine growth restriction or oligohydramnios was that of Dr. O'Brien.

The decline was a departure from the pattern observed at least since 0415 hours. The change in heart rate was potentially indicative of a late deceleration. A late deceleration is a drop in the fetal heart rate following a contraction of the uterus and is a sign that the fetus is not being well oxygenated by way of blood circulation through the placenta\n",

At that point, reliable contact between the fetal heart and the monitor was lost. From 0455 hours forward, the strip becomes increasingly non-interpretable and of less and less assistance in assessing the well-being of the fetus. To the extent the strip can be interpreted at all, I cannot ignore Dr. Dansereau's opinion to which I have earlier referred:\n",

      "120  Dr. Diane Sawchuck who holds a PhD. in Nursing with extensive experience as a perinatal nurse and nurse educator testified to the following opinion:\n",
      "From the time that [Electronic Fetal Monitoring] is re-established at 0412, there is no notation in the chart that the physician was made aware of: 1. the late decelerations, or 2. the poor quality EFM tracing following the late decelerations rendering the tracing not interpretable. The prudent registered nurse would have ensured an interpretable tracing, particularly in the presence of late decelerations combined with a patient history of small for dates, known decreased amniotic fluid, and vaginal bleeding. It if was not possible to obtain an interpretable EFM tracing using the external EFM, a prudent RN would have informed the primary care giver. The physician would then have had the option to either perform an artificial rupture of membranes and apply a fetal scalp electrode or initiate an obstetrical consultation. However, Dr. O'Brien was not informed and was only called at 0525, arrived at 0530, and Ms. Steinebach delivered at 0537, just 7 minutes later. By not being informed of the presence of late decelerations at 0452 and 0454, loss of EFM contact, and failure to obtain interpretable data thereafter, the RN failed in her responsibility to inform the primary care provider of the patient status. [author's emphasis\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "121  Dr. Sawchuck's opinion was premised in part on the assumption that there should have been continuous electronic fetal monitoring in accord with the Hospital's protocol pertaining to antepartum bleeding. That opinion resulted from the assumption that Ms. Steinebach arrived at the Hospital while bleeding, which was not the case. The opinion also resulted from the assumption that the strip showed late decelerations as opposed to accelerations. Dr. Sawchuck acknowledged that strip interpretation was subject to observer variability\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "122  Notwithstanding the shortcomings in the foregoing assumptions, Dr. Sawchuck's opinion supports the proposition that an obstetrical nurse who was aware of the constellation of risk factors surrounding this pregnancy, would be attentive to changes that could indicate the onset of fetal distress and would notify the attending physician accordingly. The omission in this instance was the failure to alert the physician on a timely basis to the marked changes in heart rate and the failure to alert the physician to the fact that contact could not be maintained between fetal heart and monitor. It is no answer to say that monitoring was not required and therefore the loss of contact was of no consequence. The fetal heart had been monitored since 0415 hours and the monitor was relied upon to detect the heart rate prior to the loss of contact at approximately 0455 hours. The change in readings and the loss of contact were potential indicators of fetal distress of which the physician should have been notified by an obstetrical nurse. The omission to notify the physician of the marked change in circumstances constituted a breach of the duty of care, whether or not Nurse Hermogenes thought the strip might be indicating accelerations rather than decelerations\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "123  Nurse Hermogenes testified that she was more concerned with the loss of contact than she was with changes in the fetal heart rate. She responded to the loss of contact by turning Ms. Steinebach to her side, a common nursing intervention employed in an attempt to re-establish contact. When that procedure did not renew contact, Nurse Hermogenes rolled Ms. Steinebach back. Marginal contact was established but, as noted, the strip became increasingly unclear and eventually non-interpretable. Nurse Hermogenes testified that she then assessed the fetal heart rate by intermittent auscultation. No entries of the results of auscultation appear in the partogram from 0500 to 0520 hours. The records are otherwise quite meticulous. I find that it is more likely than not that Nurse Hermogenes did not assess the fetal heart rate by auscultation between 0500 and 0520 hours and the omission to do so constitutes a breach of a duty of care.\n",
      "B. Causatio\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "124  A finding that the breach of a duty caused injury or harm is appropriate if it can be said that, but for the breach, the injury or harm would not have occurred. In some circumstances, a \"but for\" determination cannot be made. Depending upon the circumstances, it may then be necessary and appropriate to consider whether the breach of duty materially contributed to the harm or injury. The limits on resorting to the so-called \"material contribution analysis\" were reviewed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Resurfice Corp v. Hanke, :\n",
      "20 Much judicial and academic ink has been spilled over the proper test for causation in cases of negligence. It is neither necessary nor helpful to catalogue the various debates. It suffices at this juncture to simply assert the general principles that emerge from the cases.\n",
      "21 First, the basic test for determining causation remains the \"but for\" test. This applies to multi-cause injuries. The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that \"but for\" the negligent act or omission of each defendant, the injury would not have occurred. Having done this, contributory negligence may be apportioned, as permitted by statute.\n",
      "22 This fundamental rule has never been displaced and remains the primary test for causation in negligence actions. As stated in Athey v. Leonati, [ ]] at para. 14, per Major J., \"[t]he general, but not conclusive, test for causation is the 'but for' test, which requires the plaintiff to show that the injury would not have occurred but for the negligence of the defendant\". Similarly, as I noted in Blackwater v. Plint, []] at para. 78, \"[t]he rules of causation consider generally whether 'but for' the defendant's acts, the plaintiff's damages would have been incurred on a balance of probabilities.\"\n",
      "23 The \"but for\" test recognizes that compensation for negligent conduct should only be made \"where a substantial connection between the injury and the defendant's conduct\" is present. It ensures that a defendant will not be held liable for the plaintiff's injuries where they \"may very well be due to factors unconnected to the defendant and not the fault of anyone\": Snell v. Farrell, [] at p. 327, per Sopinka J.\n",
      "24 However, in special circumstances, the law has recognized exceptions to the basic \"but for\" test, and applied a \"material contribution\" test. Broadly speaking, the cases in which the \"material contribution\" test is properly applied involve two requirements.\n",
      "25 First, it must be impossible for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant's negligence caused the plaintiff's injury using the \"but for\" test. The impossibility must be due to factors that are outside of the plaintiff's control; for example, current limits of scientific knowledge. Second, it must be clear that the defendant breached a duty of care owed to the plaintiff, thereby exposing the plaintiff to an unreasonable risk of injury, and the plaintiff must have suffered that form of injury. In other words, the plaintiff's injury must fall within the ambit of the risk created by the defendant's breach. In those exceptional cases where these two requirements are satisfied, liability may be imposed, even though the \"but for\" test is not satisfied, because it would offend basic notions of fairness and justice to deny liability by applying a \"but for\" approach.\n",
      "26 These two requirements are helpful in defining the situations in which an exception to the \"but for\" approach ought to be permitted. Without dealing exhaustively with the jurisprudence, a few examples may assist in demonstrating the twin principles just asserted.\n",
      "27 One situation requiring an exception to the \"but for\" test is the situation where it is impossible to say which of two tortious sources caused the injury, as where two shots are carelessly fired at the victim, but it is impossible to say which shot injured him: Cook v. Lewis, . Provided that it is established that each of the defendants carelessly or negligently created an unreasonable risk of that type of injury that the plaintiff in fact suffered (i.e. carelessly or negligently fired a shot that could have caused the injury), a material contribution test may be appropriately applied.\n",
      "28 A second situation requiring an exception to the \"but for\" test may be where it is impossible to prove what a particular person in the causal chain would have done had the defendant not committed a negligent act or omission, thus breaking the \"but for\" chain of causation. For example, although there was no need to rely on the \"material contribution\" test in Walker Estate v. York Finch General Hospital, [] this Court indicated that it could be used where it was impossible to prove that the donor whose tainted blood infected the plaintiff would not have given blood if the defendant had properly warned him against donating blood. Once again, the impossibility of establishing causation and the element of injury-related risk created by the defendant are central\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "125  In this instance, the first requirement in relation to causation is to determine when the abruption caused Mirella's injury. The next requirement is to determine whether it can be said that but for the breach of duty by Dr. O'Brien or Nurse Hermogenes, Mirella would have been delivered before the complete abruption caused injury. If that question cannot be answered, then one must consider whether the circumstances are such that the material contribution test should result in liability\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "126  The evidence at trial indicates that a fetus will ordinarily be able to withstand a complete placental abruption and the resulting hypoxia without adverse effect on the brain for a period of 10 to 20 minutes following the occurrence of the abruption. The onset of damage is delayed because of the presence of residual oxygen in the fetal circulatory system serving the brain. When the blood oxygen supply has been sufficiently reduced to cause damage, the amount of damage is progressively more severe as the period of hypoxia is prolonged. The damage progresses and becomes most severe within a further period of 10 to 20 minutes, that is 20 to 40 minutes following the occurrence of the abruption, and will likely cause death after 25 minutes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "127  I accept the evidence of the medical experts that in this case it is not possible to accurately pinpoint the time of the occurrence or onset of the complete abruption or the point at which damage to the brain first occurred. However, I find that the damage resulting from the abruption more likely than not occurred not earlier than 0517 hours and not later than 0527 hours, or 10 to 20 minutes before Mirella's birth at 0537 hours. It follows that if Mirella had been delivered at any time before 0517 hours, it is more likely than not that she would not have suffered hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "128  There is no suggestion that anything done or not done by Dr. O'Brien caused the abruption. The question, however, is whether it can be said that but for the breaches of either or both of Dr. O'Brien and Nurse Hermogenes, it was more likely than not that Mirella would have been delivered before 0517 hours\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "129  The evidence establishes, and I find, that Mirella could have been delivered without caesarean section any time after 0430 hours by which time Ms. Steinebach was nine centimetres dilated and the fetus had descended in the birth canal to station \"0\". Mirella certainly could have been delivered at 0510 hours by which time the cervix was fully dilated. How much earlier than 0510 hours the cervix became fully dilated is not known and cannot now be determined given the absence of any vaginal examination in that 40 minute period\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "130  There is no evidence to indicate whether it was reasonable or unreasonable for Nurse Hermogenes to refrain from assessing the extent of dilation between 0430 and 0510 hours either in the ordinary course, or in the particular circumstances of this case given that she was aware of the factors that could affect the welfare of this fetus in the course of labour. While Nurse Hermogenes could have regarded the variations in heart rate as accelerations rather than late decelerations, assuming she observed the strip at the time, I accept the evidence of Dr. Sawchuck that because of the risk factors of which she was aware, Nurse Hermogenes should have informed Dr. O'Brien of what she had observed, if she had in fact observed the strip at the time, and of the extent of dilation. This information should have been communicated to Dr. O'Brien at, or minutes after, 0500 hours. Dr. O'Brien would then have been in a position to attend immediately, to assess the urgency of the situation, to consider whether the membranes should be artificially ruptured in order to allow a scalp clip to be attached to the fetus and in all likelihood hasten delivery, or whether delivery should be expedited. There is no reason why rupturing the membranes would not have hastened delivery, as was the case when the membranes were actually ruptured at 0532 hours to be followed by delivery at 0537 hours. I find it more likely than not that if Dr. O'Brien had been called to the delivery suite at or soon after 0500 hours, she would have ruptured the membranes and hastened delivery as she did at 0532 hours\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "131  I find it more likely than not that if Dr. O'Brien had appropriately assessed Ms. Steinebach at 2250 hours on March 30, with due regard for the constellation of risk factors of which she was or should have been aware at 2250 hours, she would then have consulted with an obstetrician. As Dr. O'Brien testified, her threshold for consultation was very low. It is not now possible to know what an obstetrician would have counselled in the circumstances, or what course of assessment and monitoring would have been followed. I cannot accept the opinion of Dr. Dansereau and Dr. Pendleton that an obstetrician would have done nothing, as the opinion of each was premised on the adequacy of Dr. O'Brien's initial assessment. What is known, is that through her omission to consult an obstetrician, Dr. O'Brien created the environment that caused Mirella to be delivered after the onset of the harm occasioned by the complete abruption. Nurse Hermogenes augmented the risk by omitting to notify Dr. O'Brien of the changes in the status of the fetus that she detected or should have detected\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "132  Had Dr. O'Brien appropriately assessed Ms. Steinebach and the fetus at the outset and decided it was not necessary to consult an obstetrician, it is more likely than not that she would have instructed Nurse Hermogenes to be vigilant and to notify her of any sign that might indicate fetal compromise. Had that been done and had Dr. O'Brien been called to the delivery suite on a timely basis, it is more likely than not that Dr. O'Brien would have observed the late decelerations which she had no difficulty detecting when she looked at the strip, post-delivery. Dr. O'Brien agreed that had she been called to the delivery suite to observe the strip, there were steps that she could have taken to deliver Mirella immediately. Dr. O'Brien was qualified to use a vacuum extractor and she recognized that the fetus had descended in the birth canal to a point where that device could have been used to assist the delivery. Dr. O'Brien agreed that rupturing the membranes would have sped up delivery although she could not say by how much. I find that it is more likely than not Dr. O'Brien would have done that which she could have done, just as she did upon arrival in the delivery suite at 0530 hours\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "133  Having regard for all of the evidence, I find as a fact that if Dr. O'Brien had appropriately assessed Ms. Steinebach and the fetus at 2250 hours on March 30, and if Nurse Hermogenes had reported her observations to Dr. O'Brien any time between 0455 and 0500 hours as she should have done, Mirella would have been delivered before 0517 hours and before the onset of harm occasioned by the abruption. The \"but for\" test has been satisfied. Should that not be the case because it is not possible to know what those persons in the labour and delivery chain would have done had Dr. O'Brien conducted an appropriate assessment of Ms. Steinebach and the risks to the fetus at 2250 hours, then the circumstances warrant application of the \"material contribution\" test to which the Supreme Court of Canada referred in Snell v.

The parties advised that they agreed on the reasonable base measure of the cost of future care in the event of liability. The actual quantification of the award under that head is dependent upon the determination of life expectancy. The parties agreed that in the event of liability, the value of Ms. Steinebach's \"in trust\" claim should be assessed at $100,000, and special damages and home adaptation costs should be assessed at $100,000.\n",

      "137  Ms. Steinebach says that Mirella can reasonably be expected to live another 20 to 25 years to age 25 or 30. Dr. O'Brien says that Mirella's additional life expectancy is another six to eight years to age 11 or 13. The mere statement of the range points to the fact that the determination of life expectancy is realistically an exercise in speculation. Some in Mirella's circumstances will live longer lives than others, and some, shorter. Mirella's life expectancy cannot be determined with any degree of accuracy\n",

Dr. O'Brien and Nurse Hermogenes responded with similar evidence from Dr. Robert Armstrong, a specialist in developmental paediatrics who is also head of the Department of Paediatrics, UBC Faculty of Medicine, and head of the Department of Paediatrics, British Columbia's Children's Hospital. In addition, Dr. O'Brien and Nurse Hermogenes adduced statistical evidence on the life expectancy of children suffering from cerebral palsy from Dr. David Strauss, an expert in the statistics of life expectancy, who is based in California. There is no doubt that all three are eminently qualified in their spheres of endeavour. The challenge is to apply their expertise to the assessment of Mirella's life expectancy\n",

The largest database compiled to date is that maintained by Dr. Strauss in the State of California pertaining to individuals with cerebral palsy who are resident and treated in that State. Dr. Strauss expressed his opinion that from a statistical point of view, a child with Mirella's principal deficits had a life expectancy of 15.3 years at age four, 15.2 years at age five; and 15.00 years at age six. In the event the statistical estimate is accurate, Mirella should be expected to live to age 20. The principal deficits to which Dr. Strauss refers are a lack of mobility, including the inability to lift one's head in the prone position, the requirement for tube feeding, and the presence of seizures\n",

      "140  I do not perceive Dr. Purtzki and Dr. Armstrong to differ to any significant degree in their assessment of Mirella' condition. At the time of their respective assessments in the spring of 2009, Mirella had significant global development delay in all areas; had limited understanding and meaningful expression of language and was non-verbal; could not roll from her stomach to her back but could roll from her back to her stomach on her right side; had an ability to grasp and release objects with both hands but would not consistently hold a toy; had no self-help skills and was completely dependent upon her caregivers; and enjoyed interacting with people\n",

      "\n",
      "142  In a report dated October 23, 2009, Dr. Purtzki expressed her opinion that Mirella had a life expectancy ranging from her late 20's to early 30's giving her 20 to 25 years of additional life expectancy. That assessment resulted from Dr. Purtzki's assessment of Mirella's cognitive disability, her generalized seizure disorder, and the challenges associated with nutrition and recurrent respiratory infections, but with due regard for reported improvements in mobility and the excellent quality of parental and medical care provided to Mirella\n",

      "\n",
      "143  Dr. Armstrong expressed his opinion that Mirella was extremely physically impaired and profoundly compromised in her overall development and was persistently compromised with recurrent pneumonia and seizures that are not fully controlled. He regarded Mirella's as one of the most severe cases of cerebral palsy he had assessed. Dr. Armstrong referenced the work of Dr. Strauss and expressed the opinion that the cohort to which Mirella should be compared was that group which at four years did not lift their heads in a prone position and who were fed by others. That cohort had a median life expectancy of 20 years. However, because of the severity of Mirella's health problems, Dr. Armstrong testified that he would expect her life expectancy to be significantly less than the median. In his opinion, Mirella has a life expectancy of ten to twelve years or an additional six to eight years of life from age four\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "144  Ms. Steinebach says that Mirella can reasonably be expected to live more than the average number of additional years because her mobility has improved, her seizures have declined, the incidence of respiratory illness has declined, she has demonstrated the capacity to roll, she can lift her chest and head to some degree, and she can assume a crawling stance although she is unable to actually crawl. In addition, Mirella's parents are vigilant and caring, and she lives in a community where she has access to outstanding, if not exceptional, health care services, factors which predict a better than average outcome\n",

There have been some improvements in mobility, and some decline in the frequency of seizures which are better controlled by medication. The respiratory problems that appear to be of particular concern to Dr. Armstrong have been controlled to some extent with better results. Dr. Armstrong's estimate that Mirella will survive for an additional six to eight years seems unreasonably pessimistic. On the other hand, the suggestion that Mirella will live into her late 20's or early 30's is overly optimistic given the severity of her deficiencies and the statistical evidence\n",

In the case of catastrophic injuries, the cap has been justified because of the pain and suffering endured by the victim, the victim's cognitive ability to appreciate his or her impaired circumstances, and the prospect that an award can provide amenities that will be a partial substitute for the loss of the capacity to enjoy life. Ms. Steinebach says that regardless of her cognitive disability, Mirella's injury was catastrophic.

It is likely that she will suffer a range of respiratory illnesses through her lifetime. Her motor ability is severely restricted. She will never be able to walk. She may be able to turn herself over but she cannot yet do so at age five. There is no way of knowing what appreciation, if any, Mirella has or will have of her circumstances.

Based on average figures for females in British Columbia with high school graduation, the loss has been set by Mr. Carson at $52,000. Mr. Carson said that using the same formula, that is historical, that a loss of earnings for a male would be $134,000. Counsel for Ms. Beaudry has suggested that the average of those should be awarded. In recent reasons of Mr. Justice Finch he rejected the approach of using the figures for a female. He found that that represented a gender bias and consequently he used the figures for a male and then reduced them to compensate for the historical pattern and for contingencies such as child bearing and rearing on the part of a female. I am not in any way suggesting that Mr. Justice Finch was wrong in his approach but I am not prepared to follow it. I will use the historical pattern but recognize that in the future the disparity between males and females will narrow.

He knew a name had been found, there was a name floating around, but there were no specifics. He knew he would have to amend the writ and add the name of the defendant. He said he only obtained Mr. Grewal's address shortly before bringing an application in March 2013 to add Mr. Grewal as a defendant. The master dismissed his application.

She had only travelled about one and a half car lengths straightforward, i.e. one or two seconds of travel. He saw her car just before she squared off and he hit his brakes.

She approached the end of the block. The cross street, Glen Drive, was at a slight downward slope towards her. Cyclists were coming down from the top of the slope at a fast speed. She stopped completely, hoping they would come down the slope and carry on. She was trying to avoid them\n",

      "52  The plaintiff, who was among the cyclists on Glen, did not carry on down the slope but made a right turn onto 10th Avenue and hit her car. His head was turned, looking back, and he was going really fast. The back wheel of his bike was damaged\n",

Her car was stationary in the middle of a narrow street with parked cars on both sides and she could not move to the right or left. In one to two seconds from turning he crashed into her.

This was done in order to test whether there had been any complicity with respect to this convenient account of events. Mr. Carmount denied having met the plaintiff before the accident.

      "49  In Wormald v. Chiarot,  at paras. 14-15, the Court of Appeal recently outlined the relevant analysis for contributory negligence as follows:\n",
      "[14] The analysis for contributory negligence involves two considerations: (1) whether the plaintiff failed to take reasonable care in her own interests; and (2) if so, whether that failure was causally connected to the loss she sustained: Enviro West Inc. v. Copper Mountain Mining Corporation,  at para. 37.\n",
      "[15] To satisfy the requirement of a causal connection between the plaintiff's breach of the standard of care and the loss sustained, the defendant must establish more than that but for her negligence, the damage would have been avoided. The plaintiff's conduct must be a \"proximate cause\" of the loss in that the loss results from the type of risk to which the appellant exposed herself: Bevilacqua v. Altenkirk,  at paras. 39-43 (per Groberman J., as he then was). In other words, the plaintiff's carelessness must relate to the risk that made the actual harm which occurred foreseeable: Cempel v. Harrison Hot Springs Hotel Ltd. ,  (C.A.) at para. 13\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "50  In light of this, I find that the evidence supports the defendant's contention that the plaintiff played a key role in causing the accident. The plaintiff's statement to the RCMP undermines the idea that, at the time of the accident, the light was amber. Instead, I find that, in suddenly braking, the plaintiff failed to take reasonable care for his own interests, an action that was causally connected to his injuries. The nature of the plaintiff's injuries is consistent with those one would suffer from being rear ended after suddenly braking. Consequently, this was a foreseeable risk directly related to the plaintiff's carelessness, and so there are no remoteness issues\n",

The plaintiff suggests that his past loss of wages be calculated from his earnings at Amica where, in 2013, he was earning $3,866.00 per month. He suggests that this figure be adjusted downwards to $3,300.00 to take into account the fact that he would have been in a new position. In addition, he suggests that this figure ($3,300.00) be adjusted to subtract $2,116.00 in monthly employment insurance benefits for the period September 2014 to February 2015.

      "\n",
      "25  Until 2008 an aluminum vehicle gate was attached to the northwest corner fence post of the paddock on the Allison Property. When closed, the vehicle gate paralleled the culvert. When open, the south end of the vehicle gate swung to the west so that the gate paralleled the fence. The gate allowed vehicles on the Allison Property to drive through the paddock and into the western portion of the Allison Property\n",

      "26  When Mrs. Allison moved to the Allison Property in 1993, the only water features on her property were the year-round creek and a small pond/bog approximately four feet by six feet in size and situated along her south property line. The bottom of the bog was lined with a tarp. After one or two years, Mrs. Allison removed the tarp and the bog dried up although water continued to be present in the bog for half of the year during the rainy season. The water came from the Rockwell Property and from the southeast corner of the Allison Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  After moving to the Allison Property, Mrs. Allison constructed dog pens in the northeast corner of her property, installed a Big-O pipe measuring four inches in diameter in the ground running from the southeast end of the pens towards the east end of the barn to allow water to drain away from the pens, and removed the chicken coop and lean-to. Mrs. Allison constructed and installed the pens and the Big-O pipe in or around 1994 and removed the chicken coop and lean-to sometime before 2001\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  Before the Water Problem made it close to impossible to do so, the Plaintiffs used the Allison Property for a variety of outdoor activities including tobogganing, bonfires, birthday parties, horseback riding, dirt-biking, paintball, an annual pig roast and dog kennelling/training. Friends and family visited to participate in these activities. The horse paddock and barn accommodated up to four horses at a time. An exercise ring for the horses was located to the south of the paddock\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  The Defendants moved to the Radtke Property in June 1999. It is not disputed that after their arrival they cleared about one and-a-half acres of land, encompassing about 30 trees as well as large stumps, in the area on their property located to the north and northwest of the paddock on the Allison Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  Around 2001, Mrs. Allison observed the Defendants dig a trench across the Radtke Property from the north property line into the pond on the south side of the Radtke Property. The trench ended about three feet north of the shared fence line between the Properties and was located along the bottom of a natural depression that ran through the Radtke Property and which ended at the pond. It is not in dispute that this alteration occurred\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  Mrs. Allison saw drain rock being placed in the trench, then a Big-O pipe, then soil. The north end of the Big-O pipe was higher in elevation than the south end. The Plaintiffs called this the \"French Drain\". Regardless of whether it actually falls within the definition of a \"French Drain\", a point that I do not and need not consider, I will use this shorthand description for the sake of simplicity and brevity\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "32  While the French Drain was being constructed, Mrs. Allison testified that Mr. Radtke asked her to lower the culvert on the Allison Property so that he could connect the south end of the Radtke Big-O pipe to it. Mrs. Allison declined. After the French Drain was installed, Mrs. Allison noticed that the pond had disappeared and that the ground where the pond had been was now about six feet higher than the ground on her side of the fence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "33  According to Mrs. Allison, the Water Problem began within days after installation of the French Drain. Water and mud entered the Allison Property from immediately north of the culvert where the pond on the Radtke Property used to be located. Water flowed into the north end of the culvert, out the south end, and toward the Rockwell Property. Mr. Allison saw water coming through the fence onto the Allison Property and through the culvert within weeks of the installation of the French Drain\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  Shortly after the Water Problem began, Mrs. Allison saw an orange-coloured sludge in the water entering the Allison Property that she had not seen before\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  About two weeks after the Water Problem began, Mrs. Allison dug a pit between the north end of the culvert and the fence about two feet in depth, width, and length. She placed a metal grate over the north end of the culvert and filled the pit with drain rock. This seemed to temporarily prevent sludge from flowing through the culvert, but water continued to flow through it. At times the pit became clogged so Mrs. Allison would dig it out and replace the drain rock. She added a mesh filter to the pit and eventually dug a ditch from the south end of the culvert to the crest of the bank to guide water to the creek running east to west on the Rockwell Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  About one year after the Water Problem began, Mrs. Allison enlarged the ditch and placed in it a perforated Big-O pipe four inches in diameter. Water and sludge flowed continually from the south end of the Big-O pipe, which Mrs. Allison would occasionally have to unclog\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  Around the time that Mrs. Allison installed the Big-O pipe, she noticed a septic smell emanating from the water coming out of the south end of the culvert. Fifty feet south of the south end of the culvert, she found white/grey water pooling and emitting a septic smell. She covered the spot with a board after digging a small pit beside it. The septic smell presented itself occasionally until 2009, at which time the Defendants repaired their septic system. Since the Water Problem began, Mr. Allison noticed a septic smell in the northwest corner of the paddock at times\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  In 2003 or 2004, Mrs. Allison removed the culvert and the four inch diameter Big-O pipe. She relocated the culvert about 20 feet south and 10 feet east from its original position and retained its north-south orientation. She enlarged the rock pit and installed a perforated Big-O pipe six inches in diameter which ran for about 120 feet from the pit to the south, ending where the four inch Big-O pipe had terminated (i.e., 30 to 40 feet from her south property line). She covered the Big-O pipe with more drain rock, a filter, and dirt. This initially seemed to draw most of the water entering the Allison Property from the Radtke Property into the Big-O pipe, but water eventually began to overwhelm the pit, come to the surface, and flow south and parallel to the Big-O pipe. The area affected by the water was about ten feet wide east to west and extended from the shared fence to the south property line\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  About three years after the Water Problem began, the paddock became increasingly damp. Bark mulch in the paddock rotted and had to be replaced. Around 2006, Mrs. Allison excavated the mulch and replaced it with a layer of sand covered by a nylon fabric or mesh and a layer of cedar mulch. The Water Problem continued to rot the mulch and, in 2007, Mrs. Allison excavated the paddock again without removing the underlying soil. The mulch has not been replaced\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "40  Between 2001 and 2007, the Defendants occasionally deposited fill onto the Radtke Property and spread it around the area where the pond on the Radtke Property had been and to the north of the paddock. The Defendants continued to clear trees and stumps on the Radtke Property during this period. Mr. Allison stated that as the Defendants deposited more fill on the Radtke Property between 2001 and 2007, the Water Problem worsened in the paddock\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "41  Between 2001 and 2007, further changes were made to the Allison Property. Mr. Allison testified that there was no change in the Water Problem immediately after any of the improvements on the Allison Property were made. The only change which is material and which I will describe in more detail is the addition to the farmhouse on the Allison Property, which started in September 2001 and was completed in early 2002. The improvements made to the Allison Property at this time included excavation of a pit, demolition of the basement and the garage, and installation of a perimeter drain with a Big-O pipe four inches in diameter around the addition to direct water away from its southwest corner. The elevation of the ground where the addition is located is about 12 feet lower than where the Water Problem at the shared property line is located\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "42  The Allisons used some of the soil excavated for the addition to \"pad\" along the bank at the southern portion of the Allison Property and some was deposited at the southwest corner of the Allison Property. In 2001 or 2002, fill was deposited along the bank on two other occasions. A total of about nine dump truck loads of fill were deposited. The height of the bank changed only by \"inches\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "43  Mrs. Allison testified that when the addition was completed, a septic field located about one to two feet lower in elevation than and about 80 feet to the south of the Water Problem was installed. Mr. Allison testified that the septic field is 100 feet south of the source of the Water Problem. The Plaintiffs sued the contractor who built the addition, a Jim Kennedy, on the basis that he damaged the septic field by driving over it. The litigation settled and it was never confirmed whether the septic field was damaged. Mr. Allison testified that there were no problems with the septic field after its installation or the incident involving Mr. Kennedy. I accept his evidence on this point\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "44  Running parallel to the north and west edges of the septic field is a Big-O pipe four inches in diameter that connects to another Big-O pipe running parallel to the south property line. The four inch Big-O pipe is buried about six inches higher than the septic field and was present when Mrs. Allison moved to the Allison Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "45  In the summer of 2008, a large -- or, as Mrs. Allison described it, a \"tremendous\" -- amount of fill was deposited on the Radtke Property and placed to the north of the paddock where the pond had formerly been located and where the French Drain had been installed. The fill raised the elevation of the Radtke Property by about five feet along the shared property line. Mr. Allison noted that before the fill was brought in, the slope of the Radtke Property was to the southwest. After the fill was deposited and spread out, the slope was to the south. Other modifications to the Radtke Property included the installation of a gravel driveway that ran parallel to the shared fence line and a manufactured home placed on a pad north by northwest of the shared property line and west of the Radtke's home\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "46  Within a week after the fill was deposited, the Water Problem worsened. Water began to bubble up from the ground about two feet north of the northwest corner of the paddock and flowed into the paddock where the rock pit was located. Water pooled, flowed south, and formed a small creek parallel to the six inch Big-O pipe. The creek flowed over the crest of the bank and into the creek on the Rockwell Property, as did water exiting the end of the six inch Big-O pipe. Pools of water in the paddock turned it into a \"large unusable mud pit\". Horses in the paddock sunk in the mud up to their knees. The sludge increased in volume in the paddock, as well as in the creek parallel to the six inch Big-O pipe, and at the south end of the six inch Big-O pipe\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "47  Mr. Allison also testified that, after the Defendants deposited significant amounts of fill in 2008, the Water Problem became more severe. Water entered the paddock from all along the fence and saturated the entire paddock\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  The Water Problem has continued since 2008. Water enters the Allison Property from at least four points along the fence and flows constantly out of the south end of the six inch Big-O pipe and along the surface in the creek parallel to it. The creek dries up for about four months each year. A swath of muddy ground extends from the north end of the paddock to the south property line which is centred on the six inch Big-O pipe and the parallel creek. The swath is about 30 feet wide during the wet season and about 16 feet wide during the dry season\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "49  Between 2008 and the time of trial, several further changes were made to the Allison Property. They are not material, with the exception of two changes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "50  In 2007 or 2008, the Allisons installed a second septic system west of the addition and south of the shed. It is 12 feet lower in elevation than and 140 feet south of the Water Problem. This septic system was installed due to the Plaintiffs' mistaken belief that it was required as a result of the number of bathrooms in the addition\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "51  In 2009, the Allisons constructed a shop where the barn was once located (it was demolished in 2007). Mr. Allison described the shop as being located 10 to 12 feet south of the shared fence line between the Properties. The shop's drainage system consisted of a perforated Big-O perimeter drain six inches in diameter which fed into a sump box located to the west of the shop. A perforated six inch Big-O pipe extended west from the sump box and along the north side of the horse shed. The six inch Big-O pipe was routed through a culvert oriented east-west, after which it turned to the south. The pipe then traveled through a culvert oriented north-south and ran 100 to 120 feet to the crest of the bank on the southern side of the Allison Property. Mrs. Allison removed the six inch Big-O pipe which ran from the pit to the southern part of the Allison Property. She widened the trench in which that pipe had been placed and put the new six inch Big-O pipe in it. The entire pipe was installed in the trench, buried in drain rock, and covered with a filter and backfill. She also placed a new six inch Big-O pipe running south from the pit; it entered the north-south culvert, at which point it ran alongside the other new Big-O pipe, and terminated inside the culvert. This Big-O pipe helped reduce the severity of the Water Problem. Mrs. Allison also removed a four inch Big-O pipe running east to west in the vicinity of the shop that had been present since she moved to the Allison Property and replaced it with a six inch Big-O pipe\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "52  Mrs. Allison testified that, after 2008, there was no landscaping, filling, or grading in the area of the Allison Property affected by the Water Problem or in the areas around the shop and the paddock\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "53  Mrs. Allison testified that the parties were friendly but not friends before the Water Problem worsened in 2008. They went to a local pub with others a couple of times. The Defendants visited the Allison Property, along with other people that the Plaintiffs knew, for karaoke parties. The Defendants attended one or two pig roasts; the last one was in 2009. Mr. Allison stated that, before the litigation commenced, he had visited the Radtke Property four or five times. He said that Mr. Radtke would come over for the odd visit or karaoke event, but he did not see Mr. Radtke much\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "54  In June 2009, Mrs. Allison sent an e-mail to the Defendants advising them that she could not accept any further drainage from the Radtke Property onto the Allison Property. In the e-mail, Mrs. Allison asked the Defendants to install a sump box on their property where the water was entering the Allison Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "55  About one month later, Mrs. Allison and her son met the Defendants on the Allison Property. The Defendants observed the Water Problem. Mrs. Allison mentioned the septic smell; Mrs. Radtke denied it came from the Radtke Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "56  After this meeting, the parties continued to exchange e-mails. They met to discuss hiring an expert to investigate the Water Problem. According to Mrs. Allison, Mrs. Radtke threw up her hands, refused to dig up the Radtke Property, walked away, and told the Plaintiffs to sue the Defendants if they wanted changes made to the Radtke Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "57  The parties continued to exchange e-mails after the second meeting. The Defendants accused the Plaintiffs of causing the Water Problem by making various changes to the Allison Property. The Defendants also complained about the fence panels that the Plaintiffs erected. Eventually, the e-mail correspondence ceased\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "58  After the e-mail correspondence between the parties broke down, the District of Mission, Fraser Health, and conservation officers contacted or visited the Allison Property regarding a number of complaints made by the Defendants about the Plaintiffs and the Allison Property ranging from pet noise, septic system issues, and manure-contaminated water. No findings of wrongdoing were ever made against the Plaintiffs\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "59  In November 2009, Mrs. Allison started these proceedings. Afterwards, the Defendants began taking photographs and recording video of the Allison Property. Mrs. Allison frequently saw Mr. Radtke taking pictures of the Allison Property, some of which featured Mrs. Allison and others. She saw Mr. Radtke stand on a ladder to take pictures over the fence panels and through the bushes. The surveillance would last \"up to four hours at a time\" and \"it went on for several months\". I accept her evidence on this point. Indeed Mrs. Radtke watched the property daily and kept a log of her observations\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "60  Regarding the effect of the Water Problem on the use and enjoyment of the Allison Property, Mrs. Allison said that the Water Problem:\n",
      "caused the horses to sink in the mud in the paddock and get sole rot and lice (it became inhumane, too expensive, and overly burdensome for Mrs. Allison to keep the horses on the Allison Property, so she sold them);\n",
      "interfered with outdoor activities (there is no more horseback riding, people have to walk through mud and water to reach the bonfire area, vehicles and campers can no longer access the Allison Property to the west of the paddock because they become stuck in the mud unless the ground is frozen, friends and family do not visit as often as they used to, annual pig roasts are attended by less people, and activities such as birthday parties, bonfires, and paintball games have been reduced by 75%); and\n",
      "necessitated the relocation of the vehicle gates from the northeast and northwest corners to the middle of the west and east sides of the paddock\n",

      "['75%']\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "61  Mrs. Allison testified she feels emotionally defeated by the Water Problem. She fears that it will cause her to lose the money that she invested in the Allison Property. Losing her horses was devastating. She feels violated by the Defendants' surveillance activities and complaints to the authorities\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "62  The Water Problem prevented Mrs. Allison from starting a dog training business that she planned to operate from the shop starting in 2009. The shop was to be used as the business office to house a library and host small dog-training classes, consultations, demonstrations, and presentations. Mr. Allison prepared a website for the business. Mrs. Allison bought furniture and equipment for the shop, designed programs, handouts, and application forms, obtained a business licence, and made business cards. She planned to charge $75 per hour and work five days per week, five hours per day. Clients were waiting for the business to launch\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  Mrs. Allison could not start her dog training business in 2009 due to the time and money she had to spend to address the Water Problem and this litigation, and due to the large area of the Allison Property that the Water Problem affects. Her efforts to address the Water Problem exacerbated her health problems and rendered her unable to run the business. She hopes to pursue the business at a later date\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  The Plaintiffs incurred many expenses in relation to their efforts to fix the Water Problem. Mrs. Allison purchased drain pipes, drain rock, and bark mulch/hog fuel. She rented excavators and installed remedial drainage works. The Plaintiffs kept receipts of certain expenses (the earliest is dated October 22, 2001). Mrs. Allison also obtained estimates for the cost of potential remedial works including replacing trees along the fence line in the event it is necessary to install drainage works to fix the Water Problem.\n",

      "66  There is a \"depression\" running from north to south on both the Allison Property and on the Radtke Property. On both the eastern and western sides of the depression, the land slopes down towards the center of the depression. Aside from the area where water backed up in the area adjacent to the Allison Property, the Defendants say that there is little evidence of any water, mud, or sludge flowing in the depression on the Radtke Property\n",
      "======\n",

      "67  Mrs. Radtke said that when the Defendants moved to the Radtke Property, it was largely overgrown with brush, shrubs, and blackberry bushes. There was a small area at its southern part where water pooled because water backed up because of the higher elevation of the Allison Property. At that time, there was also a wet area at an elevation below the Allison Property on the western part of the Radtke Property. There was one septic system, which was registered with the Central Fraser Valley Health Unit. In 2008, a septic field was installed for a manufactured home that was placed on the Radtke Property for Mrs. Radtke's parents. In 2009, the Defendants replaced the old septic field to the house on the Radtke Property. The new septic field was installed by a contractor and certified by the Fraser Health Authority. Mrs. Radtke says that she never smelled a septic odour on the Radtke Property\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "69  The Defendants said that there has never been a swamp in the area behind the house on the eastern half of the Radtke Property. The only area that could have been considered to be a swamp would have been the area where water backed up from the Allison Property due to the increased height of the Allison Property in the depression near the property line that divides the Properties\n",

      "70  The north end of the culvert on the Allison Property, prior to being removed and relocated by Mrs. Allison, was situated within the area of the paddock by a vehicle gate and was higher in elevation than or at the surface level of the water backup on the Radtke Property. Vehicles would access the back of the Allison Property (to the west) by driving through that area. Sometimes water would run through the original culvert to the other side. During the winter months, the majority of the time the water reached bottom level or even more of the north side of the original culvert\n",

When Mrs. Allison declined, the Defendants chose to install a perforated Big-O pipe on the Radtke Property in a part of the depression generally running north to south with the intention to reduce the amount of water that would back up at the property line in the depression (i.e., the main component of the French Drain). Mr. Radtke said that the French Drain was between 166 and 170 feet long. It was installed such that it ran in a slightly westward direction from north to south, and sloped towards the south. The French Drain was installed below the surface as it was at the time, such that the French Drain did not run through any fill that was later placed on top of the surface of the Radtke Property. The Defendants did place fill within the area of the depression at the shared fence line\n",

The manufactured home was completed in or around October 2008. Also in 2008, the Defendants installed a gravel driveway to the manufactured home which passed over the depression adjacent to the shared fence between the two Properties. The driveway is located approximately 18 feet north of the south property line and runs east-west along the shared fence line. The driveway hooks north at the western end of its run, thus making it J-shaped, and ends at the pad where the manufactured home is now situated\n",

He monitored the south end of the Big-O pipe while the hose was running, but at no time did he observe any water emerge from the southern end of the Big-O pipe. Even so, Mr. Radtke capped and plugged the southernmost end of the Big-O pipe\n",

The Plaintiffs excavated in the area numerous times and from 2001 onward constructed an addition to their home requiring excavation and movement of soil to other areas of the Allison Property. The northern area of the depression in the area of the paddock was lowered in elevation in 2008 or 2009. According to the Radtkes, over time, the Plaintiffs changed the slope of the Allison Property by making it more level. Apart from them saying so, there is little in the way of evidence to confirm this generalized assertion\n",

In 2001, she saw dirt moved to an area west of an addition and the excavation of a septic field. In 2001, she saw dirt moved to the south side of the Allison Property and the Plaintiffs starting to level the south side of the Allison Property. In 2002 or 2003, she saw dump trucks on the Allison Property. In 2003 or 2004, she saw an excavator removing bark mulch from the paddock. In 2007, she saw excavators on the Allison Property twice; on one of these occasions, excavators were being operated at night with lights on. In 2007, the bottom of the paddock was excavated and the paddock was lowered a number of feet. In 2008 and 2009, she saw excavators on the Allison Property on two and three occasions respectively\n",

      "81  Mrs. Radtke testified that in her view these excavators leveled the Allison Property, smoothed it out, and generally pushed dirt and bark mulch towards the south side of the Allison Property. Generally, an area of about 100 feet wide was leveled on the Allison Property on a grade going south. She also believes the southern part of the Allison Property is now at a higher elevation. However, there is little confirmatory evidence to support this assertion\n",
      "======\n",

      "82  Up until 2007, Mrs. Radtke observed bark mulch being placed on top of bark mulch in the paddock on the Allison Property and claimed that the paddock was, until around 2007, higher than the area immediately north of it on the Radtke Property. Mrs. Radtke estimates that, while she has lived at the Radtke Property, the Plaintiffs moved the paddock 10 to 15 feet west of where it was before\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  Mrs. Radtke testified that, in undertaking the construction of the manufactured home, the Radtkes consulted with numerous contractors and installed features to redirect water away from the Allison Property, including:\n",
      "a drainage swale along the southern property line of the Radtke Property;\n",
      "a ditch along the gravel driveway redirecting water towards a drainpipe that leads water to the stream running through the Properties; and\n",
      "a buried drain along the north property line of the Radtke Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  From 2001 or 2002 to 2010, the Defendants placed some fill in the depression that ran through their property, some of which was placed in the area of the Big-O pipe. Mrs. Radtke said that between 2002 and 2006 the depth of the fill was, at its maximum, approximately one foot. She estimated that between 2002 and 2010, there were between 114 and 126 dump truck \"loads\" of fill deposited on the Radtke Property. The year in which the most amount of fill was deposited was 2008, when 20 loads of soil and 60 loads of gravel were deposited on the Radtke Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  At the time of trial, Mrs. Radtke noted that the fill was spread across an area, including the depression, of about 119 feet in width and, at its midpoint, the increase in elevation was about four feet, which tapered off on either side of this midpoint until there was no increase in elevation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  Mrs. Radtke described significant changes made by the Defendants to the Radtke Property after they moved in, which included clearing shrubs and brush, removing trees and stumps, planting grass and over 100 trees, depositing fill, constructing and installing a pad area to support a manufactured home for the parents of Mrs. Radtke, installing a gravel driveway and installing a septic field for the manufactured home, and replacing the septic field for the house on the Radtke Property. These changes, I find, resulted in the depositing of a tremendous amount of fill which leveled out the property and resulted in raising the elevation of the property in the area of the depression. In other words, the landscaping and alterations done to the Radtke Property altered the contours of their property and as such would affect the flow of water on and over their property\n",
      "======\n",

      "87  Mrs. Radtke said that until the summer of 2009, the parties were friends. She would be at the Allison Property frequently. Mr. Radtke said that he has been at the Allison Property a few times. The parties would also go out for karaoke together. The Defendants testified that at no time until June 1, 2009 were they advised by the Plaintiffs of the Water Problem. Mr. Radtke testified that he did not observe any water issues on the Allison Property prior to 2009. I cannot accept his evidence on this point, particularly in light of the correspondence and communications between the parties as to Mrs. Allison's concerns about the Water Problem prior to 2009. Mrs. Radtke noted that whenever she did see water coming up near the fence line, it was clear -- not brown -- in colour. Mr. Radtke went so far as to suggest that by the time of his evidence in March 2013 the Water Problem had disappeared. I cannot accept his evidence on this point. Video evidence of water flowing from north of the shared fence line on the Radtke Property and moving south onto and through the Allison Property on March 21, 2013, clearly contradicts Mr. Radtke's constrained interpretation of his observations about the extent of the Water Problem.

Soil was excavated where the addition would be constructed and was redistributed as backfill on the Allison Property. No additional fill was brought to the Allison Property as part of the project. The excavated area sloped to the south and to the west, so the hole was not the same depth throughout (i.e., less and less soil was removed as the excavation progressed south and west).

      "\"The water pooling on the [Allison Property] is caused by site grading for the new building and the horse shed. Site grading in this area had removed the more permeable soil and exposed the less permeable underlying soil. The perched groundwater previously flowing between the interface of the more permeable and impermeable soil has been day-lighted onto the surface. The exposed soil is not sufficiently permeable to allow infiltration of water into the ground and too flat to promote surface drainage.

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "119  The factors to be considered when assessing credibility were summarized by Madam Justice Dillon in Bradshaw v. Stenner, , aff'd , leave to appeal refused,  at para. 186:\n",
      "Credibility involves an assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness' testimony based upon the veracity or sincerity of a witness and the accuracy of the evidence that the witness provides (Raymond v. Bosanquet (Township) ,  (S.C.C.)). The art of assessment involves examination of various factors such as the ability and opportunity to observe events, the firmness of his memory, the ability to resist the influence of interest to modify his recollection, whether the witness' evidence harmonizes with independent evidence that has been accepted, whether the witness changes his testimony during direct and cross-examination, whether the witness' testimony seems unreasonable, impossible, or unlikely, whether a witness has a motive to lie, and the demeanour of a witness generally (Wallace v. Davis  (Ont. H.C.); Faryna v. Chorny,  (B.C.C.A.) [Faryna]; R. v. S.(R.D.),  at para.128 (S.C.C.)). Ultimately, the validity of the evidence depends on whether the evidence is consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole and shown to be in existence at the time (Faryna at para. 356)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "120  In assessing credibility in the face of conflicting evidence, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Novac Estate (Re),  noted the following:\n",
      "[36] There are many tools for assessing credibility:\n",
      "The ability to consider inconsistencies and weaknesses in the witness's evidence, which includes internal inconsistencies, prior inconsistent statements, inconsistencies between the witness' testimony and the testimony of other witnesses.\n",
      "The ability to review independent evidence that confirms or contradicts the witness' testimony.\n",
      "The ability to assess whether the witness' testimony is plausible or, as stated by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Faryna v. Chorny, , , it is \"in harmony with the preponderance of probabilities which a practical [and] informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions\", but in doing so I am required not to rely on false or frail assumptions about human behavior.\n",
      "It is possible to rely upon the demeanor of the witness, including their sincerity and use of language, but it should be done with caution (R. v. Mah, , , paras. 70-75).\n",
      "Special consideration must be given to the testimony of witnesses who are parties to proceedings; it is important to consider the motive that witnesses may have to fabricate evidence. R. v. J.H.,  (Ont. C.A.), paras. 51-56).\n",
      "[37] There is no principle of law that requires a trier of fact to believe or disbelieve a witness's testimony in its entirety. On the contrary, a trier may believe none, part or all of a witness's evidence, and may attach different weight to different parts of a witness's evidence. (See R. v. D.R.  at para. 93 and R. v. J.H., supra)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "121  In deciding which facts are more likely than not, I have weighed competing evidence on several issues applying the words of Mr. Justice O'Halloran in Faryna v. Chorney  (B.C.S.C.), at 174:\n",
      "In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "122  This test has been particularly helpful in determining the sequence and nature of events as between the Allisons and the Radtkes and the changes to the Radtke Property and how they have impacted on the Allison Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "123  Moreover, these principles have guided my assessment of the testimony of the witnesses. Based on my observations of each witness during their testimony, together with my consideration of the totality of their evidence as well as the photographic, video, and documentary evidence, I find that the Plaintiffs were credible witnesses whereas the Defendants, with respect, were not. Where the evidence of Mr. and Mrs. Allison conflicts with that of Mr. and Mrs. Radtke, I prefer the evidence of the Allisons and their unvarnished accounts of the observations they made in terms of the changes to their property after the installation of the French Drain on the Radtke Property and the further changes that occurred with the levelling and raising of the Radtke Property through the significant amount of fill added to the Radtke Property. The Plaintiffs testified in a forthright manner and endeavoured to answer the questions and suggestions in a calm and non-combative, manner. The Plaintiffs were not evasive in their responses to questions posed by counsel and I detected no exaggeration or minimization in their evidence. They made concessions where it was reasonable to do so\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "124  Regrettably, the same cannot be said for the Defendants, who were at times defensive and contradictory, particularly on cross-examination, and unwilling to concede what the photographic, video, and documentary evidence demonstrates. In particular, the video evidence clearly shows water coming from their side of the property line north of the shared fence and flowing onto and through the Allison Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "125  Mrs. Radtke tended to exaggerate aspects of her evidence including: the height of the Allison paddock as being several feet higher than the Radtke Property at the shared fence line; describing the Allisons' remedial efforts with the paddocks as involving excavating out several feet of bark mulch and soil; endeavouring to describe the slope at the south end of the Allison Property as \"extreme\" and then subsequently levelled out after the installation of the addition to the Allison home in 2002. The photographs do not support such a characterization. As well, Mrs. Radtke appeared to downplay the amount of fill brought on to their property and perhaps enhanced the quality of the fill deposited, despite not knowing the quality of the fill that was used. The photographs of the substantial changes to the Radtke property contradict Mrs. Radtke's efforts to underestimate the amount of fill deposited in light of the significant changes depicted in the photographs\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "126  Mr. Radtke was even less credible than Mrs. Radtke. He gave evidence that contradicted answers provided at his examination for discovery. In particular, when confronted with his evidence from his examination for discovery that he understood the Big-O pipe across the length of the Radtke Property (the French Drain) would gather water along its entire length and direct the water south towards the Allison Property, he would not adopt it. Similarly, in direct-examination he indicated that the size of the Big-O pipe for the French Drain was four inches in diameter but in his examination for discovery had described it as six to eight inches in diameter. And, he contradicted himself between direct examination and cross examination as to whether he sought Mrs. Allison's permission to have the French Drain Big-O pipe join the culvert on the Allison Property. These were not minor inconsistencies but rather inconsistencies on features of the evidence that relate directly to the issue of aspects of his knowledge about the flow of the water from his property once the alterations were made to his property. I find they were an effort at minimizing the impact of the alterations to the Radtke Property insofar as the Water Problem is concerned\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "127  More significantly, however, was the effort by the Radtkes to convince the Court that the Water Problem had been solved by March 2013 and that they had seen little to no water on the Allison Property in the year between the commencement of the trial (March 2012) and its conclusion (March 2013). The video evidence from the Allison Property taken on March 21, 2013, clearly contradicts the Radtkes' assertion that the Water Problem no longer exists\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "128  Another area that causes significant concern in respect of Mr. Radtke's credibility arises from his efforts to convince the Court that he did not lean over the property fence line in an effort to take pictures of the Allison Property. However, the orientation of one Mr. Radtke's photographs of the Allison Property, contained in Ex. #11, Tab #21, reveals the fence line to the left side of the photograph and the main portion of the photograph looking east along the south side of the fence line clearly on the Allison Property. On cross-examination, Mr. Radtke stretched the bounds of credulity to explain how he managed to take this photograph without having to lean over into the Allison Property. His testimony on this point was but one of many examples in which the Defendants tailored their evidence to evade a finding of fault by exaggerating and minimizing certain portions of their evidence where doing so would further this objective\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "129  Finally, both Mr. and Mrs. Radtke gave contradictory evidence at trial with respect to the nature of the \"ravine\" or \"depression\" on their property, the purpose, location and construction of the French Drain, the areas where they deposited and spread fill on their property, the location of the water \"daylighting\" on their property in relation to the fence line dividing the two properties, and their overall ability to observe the paddock on the Allison Property from their own property. In light of the numerous contradictions in their evidence, their argumentative nature in giving their evidence and the clear contradiction of aspects of their evidence by the photographic and video evidence, I do not find the Defendants to be credible witnesses. Where their evidence conflicts with that of the Allisons', I prefer the evidence adduced from the Allisons\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "130  My findings of fact flow from my findings of credibility. I find the Plaintiffs' account of the Water Problem, substantiated by Mr. Kneale, to be factual. The Defendants do not dispute the occurrence of the events which the Plaintiffs identify as the source and cause of the Water Problem; namely, the installation of the French Drain and the significant deposit of fill on the Radtke Property over several years. I find that the installation of the French Drain by the Defendants and the significant deposit of fill on the Radtke Property altered the natural groundwater flow in the surrounding area, such that groundwater has since flowed from the Radtke Property to the Allison Property in greater volume and with accompanying sludge. The result is that a significant portion of the Allison Property has been negatively affected by the water flowing from the Radtke Property through the middle of the Allison Property. I find that the Water Problem and flow of water from the Radtke Property across the Allison Property has been caused by the significant alterations the Radtkes have done to their property starting with the installation of the French Drain and the significant alterations to the level and elevation of their property through the deposit and spread of a tremendous amount of fill that permitted them to level the property, beautify it through landscaping, install a gravel driveway and a manufactured home on a pad for Mrs. Radtke's parents\n",

      "131  The photographic, video, and documentary evidence tendered at trial, all of which I have considered in conjunction with the viva voce evidence, support these findings of credibility and the findings of fact that inevitably follow. The photographic, video, and documentary evidence is generally in keeping with the Plaintiffs' version of events with respect to the Water Problem. Indeed, I note that the video evidence tendered on the last day of trial reveals that the Water Problem remained visibly active as of March 21, 2013\n",

These witnesses generally testified in a forthright manner. They are neutral vis-à-vis the parties and have no incentive to exaggerate or understate the contents of their evidence. Although Mr. Kennedy may very well bear some lingering annoyance towards the Plaintiffs as a result of being successfully sued by them, both the passage of time and the lack of connection between that lawsuit and these proceedings does not, in my view, detract from his credibility as a witness\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "133  With respect to the expert witnesses, I have considered the parties' submissions as to why I should accept Mr. Kneale's evidence or Mr. Chiu's evidence. I note that the evidence of these experts -- like the evidence of the Plaintiffs and the Defendants -- is more or less diametrically opposed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "134  In my view, I prefer Mr. Kneale's evidence primarily because he visited the Allison Property and was therefore optimally situated to observe and assess the source, cause, and effect of the Water Problem\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "135  Mr. Chiu did not visit the Allison Property and therefore did not closely observe the Water Problem in the vicinity of the fence line or its effects at various sites on the Allison Property. The photographic evidence of the area in and around the fence line suggests that Mr. Chiu would not have had an adequate vantage point while present on the Radtke Property to meaningfully assess the Water Problem even if, as the Defendants assert, there were no fence panels obstructing Mr. Chiu's view of the Allison Property when he first visited the Radtke Property. In light of my findings with respect to the credibility of the Radtkes I am not prepared to conclude that the fence panels were not in place and find it more likely than not that Mr. Chiu's sight lines were not as clear or direct as he would lead the Court to believe. I am not convinced that Mr. Chiu enjoyed an adequate vantage point to meaningfully assess the Water Problem or its effects on the Allison Property. Moreover, it appeared Mr. Chiu was not provided the details about the volume, composition and location of the fill that the Radtkes had deposited on their property. These two factors, coupled with his failure to look at the problem from the Allison Property side of the fence, cause me to conclude that I can place no weight on his opinion and conclusion that the cause of the Water Problem was \"extensive changes (site grading and construction of buildings) made within the Allison Property without providing proper site grading and drainage\" which, in his view, \"removed the more permeable soil and exposed the less permeable underlying soil\" and caused perched groundwater to \"daylight\" on the surface of the Allison Property. In order for these conclusions to have an air of reality, a close observation and investigation of the Allison Property in the course of a visit to the Allison Property would have to be conducted. Accordingly, I prefer the evidence of Mr. Kneale to that of Mr. Chiu and am unable to place any weight on the opinion evidence of Mr. Chiu given the significant limitations I have found with respect to the manner of his assessment of the Water Problem\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "136  I note that Mr. Chiu gave evidence to the effect that Big-O pipes can easily collapse when subjected to soil pressure. The inference which the Defendants seem to invite the Court to draw is that the Water Problem has been caused, at least in part, by damage to the various Big-O pipes situated on the Allison Property. However, none of the evidence adduced at trial suggested that the Big-O pipes on the Allison Property were in fact damaged. Without such evidence, it would be speculative, in my view, to draw the inference sought by the Defendants\n",

      "137  As for the appraisal evidence of Mr. Bendickson, while I found Mr. Bendickson generally credible, I am unable to rely on his evidence. Mr. Bendickson only visited the Allison Property for 30 minutes, during which time he took no measurements. He could only estimate the size of the area of the Allison Property affected by the Water Problem; his report suggests that he relied on a hand-drawn depiction of the Allison Property based on satellite imagery to estimate that up to one-half of the Allison Property (or 0.94 acres) was affected by the Water Problem. It is also unclear whether Mr. Bendickson's conclusion considered that the effects of the Water Problem are apparently less severe during the drier periods of the year\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "138  Finally, the basis upon which Mr. Bendickson arrived at his diminution in value figure was not clearly articulated. Assuming the correctness of his $95,000 price per acre figure, the value of the Allison Property would be $178,600 ($95,000 multiplied by 1.88 acres). This figure, when divided in half, yields $89,300 (the value of one-half of the Allison Property). It is unclear how Mr. Bendickson arrives at the conclusion that the affected area of the Allison Property has diminished in value by $65,000. His analysis on page 7 of his report totals three paragraphs and concludes:\n",
      "In reconciling the estimated loss to the affected portion of the subject site consideration is applied to the land area (slightly less than an acre from best estimates of the appraiser), and the general utility of that portion of the site that is already in partially wooded ravine. Based on all factors considered, the loss in value of the flood damaged section of the subject site is estimated to be $65,000, and is supported by the data and [reasoning] shown\n",

      "139  However, Mr. Bendickson neither articulates the \"factors considered\" nor how the data and reasoning support the estimated loss in value of the affected area of the Allison Property. Accordingly, I am unable to find the requisite degree of reliability and specificity in Mr. Bendickson's opinion that would permit me to place any weight upon the opinion. What I do accept from his evidence is his observation of the Water Problem as summarized previously at paragraph 114 of these reasons.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "140  Having accepted the Plaintiffs' evidence with respect to the nature and effects of the Water Problem, the following legal issues require determination:\n",
      "Are the Plaintiffs' claims barred by a statutory limitation period?\n",
      "Are the Defendants liable to the Plaintiffs in nuisance, trespass, or negligence?\n",
      "What is the measure of damages to which the Plaintiffs are entitled?\n",
      "Are the Plaintiffs entitled to an injunction against the Defendants\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "141  Prior to addressing these issues, I propose to briefly address and dispose of two other claims advanced by the Plaintiffs and one claim advanced by the Defendants\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "142  First, I reject the Plaintiffs' claim for damages relating to Mrs. Allison's inability to launch and operate a dog training business on the Allison Property by virtue of the Water Problem. Besides Mrs. Allison's testimony on this point, the Plaintiffs adduced very little evidence on this issue. The Defendants' reliance on the statements of the Court in Wittich v. Bob,  [Wittich], is sound. An award for loss of business opportunity is not justified in this case because, like the plaintiff in Wittich, Mrs. Allison \"has produced virtually no evidence to support a reasonable possibility of business losses between the date of the accident and the trial dates\" (para. 173). As such, \"[t]here is simply a paucity of evidence concerning the income she generated in the company while it was in operation and the amount she projects could reasonably have been earned in the future\" (para. 173). I therefore dismiss the Plaintiffs' claim for damages in respect of loss of business opportunity\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "143  Second, I also reject the Plaintiffs' claim that, as a result of attempting to fix the Water Problem, Mrs. Allison sustained physical injuries related to an autoimmune condition from which she suffers. The Plaintiffs adduced no evidence whatsoever to substantiate this claim. In the absence of such evidence, the Court is not in a position to address this claim. Accordingly, I dismiss the Plaintiffs' personal injury claim\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "144  Third, I reject the Defendants' argument that the Plaintiffs did not fulfil their duty to mitigate. The Defendants appear to ignore the evidence which demonstrates that the Plaintiffs made significant efforts to remedy the Water Problem starting shortly after the Water Problem began in 2001. In my view, based on the evidence in this case, it is implausible to argue that the Plaintiffs decided to \"sit back and incur all the damage that is possible\". With respect, the Defendants' argument comes across as an attempt to deflect blame for the Water Problem from themselves to the Plaintiffs. I find that the Plaintiffs did not fail to mitigate their damages in this case. To the contrary, their efforts over the years demonstrate they did everything they could to try and stem the flow of the Water Problem from the Radtke Property onto their property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "145  I now turn to the four issues outlined above. For the sake of brevity, I do not outline each and every submission made by the parties in respect of these issues. I have, however, carefully considered the submissions of the parties in respect of these issues in their totality as well as the authorities on which the parties rely.\n",
      "A. Are the Plaintiffs' claims barred by a statutory limitation period\n",

      "\n",
      "146  The Defendants assert that a six year limitation period applies to the Plaintiffs' claims in nuisance and negligence. The Defendants do not cite authority or a basis for this conclusion. The Defendants appear to rely on s. 3(5) of the former Limitation Act, , as repealed by Limitation Act, S.B.C. 2012, c. 13 [Limitation Act], which stipulates that any action \"not specifically provided for in this Act or any other Act may not be brought after the expiration of 6 years after the date on which the right arose\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "147  In my view, however, a two year limitation period applies to the Plaintiff's claims in nuisance, negligence, and trespass by virtue of s. 3(2)(a) of the Limitation Act:\n",
      "3 ...\n",
      "After the expiration of 2 years after the date on which the right to do so arose a person may not bring any of the following actions:\n",
      "subject to subsection 4(k), for damages in respect of injury to person or property, including economic loss arising from the injury, whether based on contract, tort, or statutory duty;\n",

      "\n",
      "149  I find support for this conclusion in the decision in ML Plaza Holdings Ltd. v. Imperial Oil Ltd., , aff'd , leave to appeal ref'd  [ML Plaza]. The defendant, Imperial Oil, operated a service station beginning in 1985 on property in a shopping mall under a lease with ML Plaza's predecessor in title. The plaintiff, ML Plaza, acquired the mall and assumed the lease in 1988. In May 1992, Imperial Oil closed the service station and removed the underground storage tanks. An Imperial Oil field audit the previous year had determined that there was a shortage of approximately 4500 litres of gasoline at the site. The plaintiff's claim was for damages arising from the defendant's occupation and use of certain lands as a gas service station from 1985 to 1997. The plaintiff claimed the defendants' negligence caused hydrocarbon contamination of the sub-soils and sub-surface waters, with resulting loss and damage to the plaintiff. The plaintiff started its action in, inter alia, nuisance and negligence on March 12, 1999 (i.e., almost seven years after the decommissioning of the service station)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "150  As in the case at bar, one of the issues in ML Plaza was whether the plaintiff's action was barred by the Limitation Act. At para. 62, Boyd J. accepted the defendant's submission that s. 3(2)(a) of the Limitation Act -- and therefore a two year limitation period -- applied to the plaintiff's claims in nuisance and negligence. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision at trial\n",

      "\n",
      "151  The Defendants' apparent reliance on s. 3(5) of the Limitation Act as support for their position that a six year limitation period applies to the Plaintiffs' claims in nuisance and negligence may stem from the jurisprudence stating that claims for or in relation to \"injury to property\" under s. 3(2)(a) of the Limitation Act must involve direct damage as opposed to indirect damage: see Low v. Petro-Canada Inc., , at paras. 46-54 [Low]. In W.C.B. (B.C.) v. Genstar Corp.  (C.A.), McLachlin J.A. (as she then was) stated at 227:\n",
      "Policy considerations support the conclusion that \"injury to property\" refers to damage caused by an identifiable external event. A short limitation period of two years is appropriate where the claim is based on an event which causes direct injury to property. Such a short limitation period may not be appropriate for a claim based on defects in the property which may not manifest themselves clearly for some time, even though with the benefit of hindsight one may be able to say that their onset was revealed at an earlier date\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "152  In my view, the damage caused to the Allison Property relates to an \"identifiable external event\"; that is, the installation of the French Drain followed by the deposit of a tremendous amount of fill that was used to level and raise portions of the southern elevation of the Radtke Property. I am supported in this conclusion by the decision in Letroy v. Armenian Apostolic Church of British Columbia,  (Co. Ct.), a case which this Court considered in Low and summarized at para. 52 of that decision:\n",
      "In Letroy, the plaintiffs claimed for damages to their house allegedly caused by subsidence resulting from the activities of their neighbours who were preparing a building site in the adjacent property. Over the span of four to six months, the building site was pre-loaded with eight to ten feet of fill. The settlement of the plaintiffs' home as a result of the fill caused physical damage to the property. It was held that the claim was properly founded in nuisance and that the appropriate limitation period for a claim in nuisance was two years under the Act\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "153  I conclude that s. 3(2)(a) of the Limitation Act applies to the Plaintiffs' claims against the Defendants' in nuisance, negligence, and trespass. These claims are therefore governed by a two-year limitation period\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "154  Returning to the Defendants' limitation period argument, the Defendants acknowledge that where there is continuing damage, a new cause of action arises each day. The Defendants rely on the Court of Appeal decision in ML Plaza for this proposition\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "155  The Defendants are, in my view, correct. ML Plaza considers the primary authority on this issue, namely the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Roberts v. City of Portage La Prairie,  [Roberts]. In Roberts, the plaintiff claimed against the City for nuisance arising out of the release of water onto his land from a sewage lagoon which the City constructed in 1958. The plaintiff commenced an action on September 20, 1965, alleging that polluted water had escaped from the lagoon on to his land and claimed damages between 1960 and 1968. The Portage la Prairie Charter provided a limitation defence:\n",
      "If any action or suit shall be brought by any person or persons, for anything done in pursuance of sections 98 to 134 of this Act, the same shall be brought within six calendar months next after the act committed; or, in case there shall be continuation of damages, then within one year after the original cause of such action arising\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "156  The trial judge found in favour of the plaintiff. He held that s. 135 of the Charter applied but that, as the continuation of the nuisance created a new cause of action each day, the plaintiff was entitled to recover all damages sustained from a date one year prior to the issuance of the statement of claim. Damages sustained between 1960 and September 19, 1964 were not recoverable because of the operation of s. 135. Damages on or after September 20, 1964 to 1968, when judgment was given, were assessed and awarded. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judgment. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court and the City cross-appealed. The Supreme Court agreed with the trial judge's conclusion that the continuation of the nuisance created a new cause of action each day that it occurred\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "157  At trial in ML Plaza, Boyd J. identified the basic principle that emanates from Roberts and which has been applied in other authorities:\n",
      "[66] There is no dispute that where damage is the cause of action or part of the cause of action, a statute of limitations runs from the date of the damage and not from the date of the act which caused the damage. If there is fresh damage within the statutory period, an action in respect of those damages will not be barred. (Roberts v. Portage la Prairie (City) (S.C.); Dufferin Paving and Crushed Stone Ltd. v. Anger ).\n",
      "...\n",
      "[72] I am satisfied that all of these case authorities make it clear that in the face of a limitation defence, the mere presence of contaminants in the soils or groundwater is not sufficient to found a claim for damages for a continuing nuisance. Rather there must be evidence of \"additional damage\" sustained within the limitation period\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "158  In ML Plaza, Boyd J. dismissed the claim of the plaintiff on the basis that no additional damage had been sustained within the relevant limitation period. As the plaintiff started its claim on March 12, 1999, it was required to prove additional damage emanating from the nuisance it alleged that the defendant created. Boyd J. found no additional damage had been sustained between March 12, 1997 and the date on which the plaintiff commenced the claim\n",
      "======\n",

      "159  In this case, the Plaintiffs started their action on November 25, 2009. In light of the Limitation Act, Roberts and ML Plaza, I conclude that the Plaintiffs cannot seek recovery for damages sustained before November 25, 2007. Although the French Drain was installed in 2001, it continued to cause the Water Problem over the intervening years such that a new cause of action arose each day. The Plaintiffs are entitled to seek recovery for damages sustained from November 25, 2007 onward. I will return to this point when I consider the measure of damages to which the Plaintiffs are entitled.\n",

      "\n",
      "160  In Antrim Truck Centre Ltd. v. Ontario (Transportation),  [Antrim], the Supreme Court of Canada addressed the legal principles governing private nuisance. A nuisance \"consists of an interference with the claimant's use or enjoyment of land that is both substantial and unreasonable\" (para. 18). Cromwell J., writing for the Court, elaborated on the test for private nuisance at para. 19:\n",
      "[19] The elements of a claim in private nuisance have often been expressed in terms of a two-part test of this nature: to support a claim in private nuisance the interference with the owner's use or enjoyment of land must be both substantial and unreasonable. A substantial interference with property is one that is non-trivial. Where this threshold is met, the inquiry proceeds to the reasonableness analysis, which is concerned with whether the non-trivial interference was also unreasonable in all of the circumstances. This two-part approach found favour with this Court in its most recent discussion of private nuisance and was adopted by the Court of Appeal in this case, at para. 80: St. Lawrence Cement Inc. v. Barrette, , , at para. 77; see also St. Pierre v. Ontario (Minister of Transportation and Communications), , at pp. 914-15, quoting with approval H. Street, The Law of Torts (6th ed. 1976), at p. 219; Susan Heyes Inc. v. Vancouver (City), , , at para. 75, leave to appeal refused , [2011] 3 S.C.R. xi; City of Campbellton v. Gray's Velvet Ice Cream Ltd.  (N.B.C.A.), at p. 441; Royal Anne Hotel Co. v. Village of Ashcroft  (B.C.C.A.), at p. 760; Fleming's The Law of Torts (10th ed. 2011), at s. 21.80; J. Murphy and C. Witting, Street on Torts (13th ed. 2012), at p. 443; L.N. Klar, Tort Law (5th ed. 2012), at p. 759\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "161  Cromwell J. described the first part of the test for private nuisance (a substantial interference with the owner's use or enjoyment of land) as follows:\n",
      "[22] What does this threshold require? In St. Lawrence Cement, the Court noted that the requirement of substantial harm \"means that compensation will not be awarded for trivial annoyances\": para. 77. In St. Pierre, while the Court was careful to say that the categories of nuisance are not closed, it also noted that only interferences that \"substantially alte[r] the nature of the claimant's property itself\" or interfere \"to a significant extent with the actual use being made of the property\" are sufficient to ground a claim in nuisance: p. 915 (emphasis added). One can ascertain from these authorities that a substantial injury to the complainant's property interest is one that amounts to more than a slight annoyance or trifling interference. As La Forest J. put it in Tock v. St. John's Metropolitan Area Board, , actionable nuisances include \"only those inconveniences that materially interfere with ordinary comfort as defined according to the standards held by those of plain and sober tastes\", and not claims based \"on the prompting of excessive 'delicacy and fastidiousness'\": p. 1191. Claims that are clearly of this latter nature do not engage the reasonableness analysis.\n",
      "[23] In referring to these statements I do not mean to suggest that there are firm categories of types of interference which determine whether an interference is or is not actionable, a point I will discuss in more detail later. Nuisance may take a variety of forms and may include not only actual physical damage to land but also interference with the health, comfort or convenience of the owner or occupier: Tock, at pp. 1190-91. The point is not that there is a typology of actionable interferences; the point is rather that there is a threshold of seriousness that must be met before an interference is actionable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "162  Cromwell J. described the second part of the test for private nuisance (an unreasonable interference with the owner's use or enjoyment of land) as follows:\n",
      "[25] ... As in other private nuisance cases, the reasonableness of the interference must be assessed in light of all of the relevant circumstances. The focus of that balancing exercise, however, is on whether the interference is such that it would be unreasonable in all of the circumstances to require the claimant to suffer it without compensation.\n",
      "[26] In the traditional law of private nuisance, the courts assess, in broad terms, whether the interference is unreasonable by balancing the gravity of the harm against the utility of the defendant's conduct in all of the circumstances: see, e.g., A.M. Linden and B. Feldthusen, Canadian Tort Law (9th ed. 2011), at p. 580. The Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal identified several factors that have often been referred to in assessing whether a substantial interference is also unreasonable. In relation to the gravity of the harm, the courts have considered factors such as the severity of the interference, the character of the neighbourhood and the sensitivity of the plaintiff: see, e.g., Tock, at p. 1191. The frequency and duration of an interference may also be relevant in some cases: Royal Anne Hotel, at pp. 760-61. A number of other factors, which I will turn to shortly, are relevant to consideration of the utility of the defendant's conduct. The point for now is that these factors are not a checklist; they are simply \"[a]mong the criteria employed by the courts in delimiting the ambit of the tort of nuisance\": Tock, at p. 1191; J.P.S. McLaren, \"Nuisance in Canada\", in A.M. Linden, ed., Studies In Canadian Tort Law (1968), 320, at pp. 346-47. Courts and tribunals are not bound to, or limited by, any specific list of factors. Rather, they should consider the substance of the balancing exercise in light of the factors relevant in the particular case\n",

      "\n",
      "163  Regarding the first part of the test for private nuisance, the evidence of the Plaintiffs, Mr. Kneale, and the photographic and video evidence reveal that the Water Problem has substantially altered the nature of the Allison Property. Before the onset of the Water Problem, groundwater was not an issue that affected the Allison Property in any notable way. After the onset of the Water Problem, however, groundwater often affects the Allison Property. The evidence also demonstrates that the Water Problem significantly interfered with the use made of the Allison Property by the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs paint a compelling \"before and after\" picture of how the Allison Property was used for various recreational activities on a frequent basis before the onset of the Water Problem and how, following its onset, these recreational activities became less frequent or ceased to occur. One example of a significant interference wrought by the Water Problem is the fact that the Plaintiffs can no longer keep horses on their property given the constant presence of water and mud on a significant portion of their property. I find that the Water Problem cannot be characterized as a slight annoyance or a trifling interference. Rather, the Water Problem is of such a nature that it significantly interferes with the actual use and enjoyment of the Allison Property and substantially alters the nature of the Plaintiffs' property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "164  Regarding the second part of the test for private nuisance, the Plaintiffs have also proven this element. The Defendants did not provide a compelling justification for the changes made to the Radtke Property which caused the Water Problem (i.e., the installation of the French Drain), which speaks to the utility of their conduct. Even if I were to accept that the French Drain was necessary to facilitate the removal of water from the Radtke Property, the gravity of the harm caused to the Allison Property by the installation of the French Drain -- that is, the Water Problem -- outweighs the utility of such conduct. Compounding matters and intensifying the Water Problem was the addition of a tremendous amount of fill to the Radtke Property. While this was done, no doubt, to improve the Radtke Property by levelling it, raising the elevation, and installing another building thereby improving the esthetic appearance, utility and value, it appears to have been done without regard to the impact the changes would have on the flow of groundwater from the Radtke Property. Home and landscaping improvements are obviously permissible, so long as they do not negatively affect the use and enjoyment of the adjoining property owners' premises. Balancing all of the circumstances in this case, the Defendants' interference with the Allison Property was unreasonable\n",

      "166  I note that the parties made submissions as to whether the common law principles concerning riparian rights operate to shield the Defendants from liability in relation to the harm caused to the Allison Property by the French Drain. These principles qualify the law of nuisance. Counsel for the Plaintiffs helpfully summarized these principles as follows:\n",
      "a landowner does not cause a nuisance if the landowner allows surface water to flow naturally across his land to a neighbour's land;\n",
      "a lower landowner need not accept surface water flowing naturally onto his property from a neighbour's property and the lower landowner may block or divert the water to prevent its entry into his or her property;\n",
      "a landowner cannot alter his or her land so that it causes surface water to collect and then flow on a neighbour's property in a manner which it would not have done so but for the alterations (i.e., a landowner cannot artificially increase or concentrate the natural flow of surface water onto his neighbour's property); and\n",

Even if an aspect of the Water Problem is attributable to the flow of surface water, I am of the view that it is as a result of the significant alterations made to the Radtke Property such that the alterations caused surface water to collect and then flow onto the Allison Property in a manner which it would not have done so but for the alterations.\n",

The Defendants point to the distinction between nuisance and trespass in support of their position\n",

      "\n",
      "171  The jurisprudence which discusses the distinction between nuisance and trespass is instructive with respect to the validity of the Plaintiffs' trespass claim. In Plaunt v. Renfrew Power Generation Inc., , R. Smith J. reviewed this jurisprudence, a portion of which is particularly helpful:\n",
      "[52] In Smith v. Inco Ltd., , (trial decision of original case of Pearson v. Inco Limited , Henderson J. adopted the following quote setting out the difference between trespass and nuisance from R.V.F. Heuston & R.A. Buckley, Salmond and Heuston on the Law of Torts, 21sted., (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 1996) at page 44.\n",
      "It is a trespass, and therefore actionable per se, to directly place material objects upon another's land; it is not a trespass, but at the most a nuisance or other wrong actionable only on proof of damage, to do an act which consequentially results in the entry of such objects. To throw stones upon one's neighbour's premises is the wrong of trespass; to allow stones from a ruinous chimney to fall upon those premises is the wrong of nuisance.\n",
      "[53] In The Law of Torts, 9th ed., John G. Fleming (Sydney: LBC Information Services, 1998), at page 48, the author states that:\n",
      "Trespass may be committed not only by an entry in person, but equally by propelling an object or a third person onto the plaintiff's land. Indeed, most cases of trespass involving actual damage deal with situations where there has been no personal entry but the defendant has initiated a force which directly causes rubbish, stones or other projectiles to be cast on or over another's property. Here again, the old distinction between direct and indirect invasion looms large. The discharge of water may be trespass or case according to whether it is immediately poured upon or only ultimately flows onto the plaintiff's property, as being first discharged on somebody else's land and later carried down to the plaintiff's. In many American blasting cases it has been held that damage from flying rocks is trespass, but from vibration or concussion at most nuisance\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "172  Based on the foregoing, the validity of the Plaintiffs' trespass claim depends on whether the Defendants directly placed the water related to the Water Problem on the Allison Property or if the Defendants did an act which consequentially resulted in the entry of the water on the Allison Property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "173  The evidence demonstrates that the water related to the Water Problem enters the Allison Property as a consequence of the French Drain and the deposit of the fill. The installation of the French Drain and the further deposit of a significant amount of fill by the Defendants on the Radtke Property was an act that consequently resulted in the entry of water onto the Allison Property. Stated differently, because the source of the Water Problem is on the Radtke Property, such that water related to the Water Problem is first discharged on the Radtke Property before entering the Allison Property, only a \"indirect invasion\" of the Allison Property has been established. Trespass demands a \"direct invasion\", which is absent in this case\n",

The effect of the culvert was that water, which accumulated north of the culvert from a large catchment area, was discharged onto the plaintiff's lands and flowed to a low-lying area from which there was no natural drainage. As a result, the plaintiff was unable to use that portion of his land until the discharge was absorbed into the land. The defendant relied upon a provision of the Municipal Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 323, which permitted it to collect water from any highway and discharge it in the most convenient natural waterway or watercourse. The defendant also claimed that it was not obliged to be put to great expense to divert water to a natural watercourse\n",

The water was not from a highway, but was merely collected in a culvert near a highway and was water originating from lands to the north. The water followed a downward course; however, this was insufficient for a finding of a natural watercourse. The Court of Appeal upheld the judgment at trial\n",

There is no evidence to suggest that the Plaintiffs caused or contributed to the Water Problem. Rather, the Water Problem was caused wholly by the Defendants' installation and maintenance of the French Drain and aggravated by the later depositing of a tremendous amount of fill on the Radtke Property such that it changed the level and contour of the property and impacted the water-table, likely causing it to rise and discharge groundwater from the Radtke Property onto the Allison Property.\n",

However, the period of that aspect of the nuisance is limited to November 25, 2007, two years before the issuance of the statement of claim in these proceedings.

Aggravated damages are often claimed as compensation for mental distress caused by a defendant's behaviour. Aggravated damages will frequently cover conduct which would also be subject to punitive damages, but their role is compensatory. They are designed to compensate a plaintiff and are measured by the plaintiff's suffering such as pain, anguish, grief, humiliation, wounded pride, damaged self-confidence or self-esteem, and similar matters caused by the conduct of a defendant: Vorvis v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia, \n",

      "[328] Aggravated damages may be awarded where the defendant has acted in a high handed or oppressive manner thereby increasing the humiliation and anxiety of the plaintiff from the libel. The key consideration in a finding of aggravating damages is the extent to which the defendant was motivated by actual malice which increased the injury to the plaintiff either by spreading further afield the damage to his reputation, or by increasing his mental distress or humiliation: Hill at para. 190\n",

The Defendants were certainly reckless regarding the effect that the installation of the French Drain and the deposit of a tremendous amount of fill would have on the Allison Property particularly after the Plaintiffs notified the Defendants in 2009 that the Water Problem had become unacceptable and the Defendants visited the Allison Property to observe the damage caused by the Water Problem. Despite these factors, I cannot conclude that their behaviour with respect to the Water Problem matches the adjectives that the relevant jurisprudence says are required before aggravated damages are awarded. To quote directly from Hill, the Court held at para. 190 that \"[i]f aggravated damages are to be awarded, there must be a finding that the defendant was motivated by actual malice, which increased the injury to the plaintiff, either by spreading further afield the damage to the reputation of the plaintiff, or by increasing the mental distress and humiliation of the plaintiff\".

I decline to grant the injunction because Mr. Kneale's recommendations pertain only to the Allison Property; he does not opine as to whether those recommended changes, if effected on the Radtke Property, would remedy the Water Problem. As it is unclear whether ordering the Defendants to take the steps recommended by Mr. Kneale on the Radtke Property would be efficacious, it would not be prudent of the Court to grant the injunction sought by the Plaintiffs.

He felt his vehicle slide across the road as the trailer swung around the tractor. As this occurred, Mr. Raoul Thiels (\"Thiels\") was approaching the same location driving a tractor trailer south, toward Williams Lake. When he saw the Sangha truck sliding sideways across the road into his path of travel, he felt that there was no option but to intentionally drive his truck off the west side of the road into a ditch and snowbank. The vehicles missed each other narrowly. Sangha's truck swung around 180 degrees and ended in the ditch on the east side of Highway 97 with the tractor facing south. Thiels' truck hit the bank of the ditch on the west side of the road and its trailer then pivoted across the travelled portion of the highway, blocking the southbound lane entirely and impinging significantly on the northbound lane\n",

It is alleged that Sangha was negligent in the manner in which he prepared his vehicle (by towing an empty pup trailer, rather than placing the pup trailer on the deck of the vehicle so as to increase its traction) or by driving in such a manner, or at such speed, as to cause him to lose control of his vehicle.

      "\n",
      "8  On January 17, 2007, Ms. Harrington travelled from Quesnel to Williams Lake with her daughter Jessica Driscoll to visit Ms. Harrington's partner, Gerald MacBurney. On the following morning as they drove north on Highway 97, returning to Quesnel, fine snow was falling steadily. The travelled portion of the road was clear but there was some accumulation of snow on the centre and the shoulders of the highway. The road had the appearance of having been cleared but Ms. Harrington has no recollection of seeing any road maintenance vehicles. At some point after leaving Williams Lake, Ms. Harrington recalls being passed by two semi-trailer trucks pulling pup trailers; she thought they were travelling fast. She believes that she was driving at about 80 to 90 km/hour through most of the trip from Williams Lake to the scene of the accident. She has no recollection of the accident. Her last memory is of passing the Alamo restaurant about 30 kilometres south of Quesnel and 90 kilometres north of Williams Lake\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "9  Jessica Driscoll recalls that as they drove north the roads were bare with just a little bit of snow in the middle and on either side of the road. She recalls following a tractor trailer for a period of time but does not recall the passing incident referred to by her mother. She was not paying close attention to her mother's driving. She does have some recollection of the accident. After seeing a puff of snow ahead of her on the road she saw a vehicle in the ditch beside the northbound lane, facing her. At the same time, another vehicle coming toward them went into the ditch beside the southbound lane and its trailer swung onto the road toward them. She remembers thinking that there was nothing that could be done to avoid the collision that followed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "10  John Koster was driving north on Highway 97 at about the time the accident occurred. He has a recollection of a Peterbilt tractor owned by G & R Contracting Ltd following him as he approached the \"S\" curve on the highway to the south of Quesnel. He felt that the vehicle was tailgating him although he was driving at what he believed to be the posted speed limit of 100 km/hour. Koster had no problem with traction but he was driving a tractor pulling an \"A\" trailer upon which a \"B\" trailer was mounted. It is his evidence that stacking the \"B\" trailer adds substantially to traction on the road surface. He believes the road surface was bare. As he went through the \"S\" turn he claims to have seen the tractor-trailer behind him begin to lose control on the turn. He did not witness an accident. There is some controversy with respect to whether and, if so, how Koster's evidence was provided to the RCMP. MacBurney says that when he learned Koster claimed to have evidence relevant to the accident he went with Ms. Harrington to the RCMP detachment to advise the police but was dismissed by an officer who told him not to tell the RCMP how to do their job. The investigating officer denies that he said or would have said such a thing\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "11  Sangha was driving one of three \"B\" trains owned by G & R Contracting Ltd heading north toward Quesnel on the day of the accident. The lead vehicle was driven by Mr. Karmjit Kondolay (\"Kondolay\"). The trailing vehicle was driven by Mr. Manprit Rai (\"Rai\"). All three drivers testified. Kondolay is an experienced driver. He says that as he drove north toward Quesnel the roads looked good. He saw no reason to be concerned, although snow was falling. Highway 97 looked to be ploughed but Kondolay did not think it had been well sanded. As he approached the \"S\" curve, his Jake brake caused him to begin to skid. He accelerated so as to remove the brake. He warned the others following him, with whom he had been in radio communication. He told them to slow down because the curve was slippery. He is uncertain whether he used his CB radio or walkie-talkie to warn the other driver. They had been communicating by CB but in the heat of the moment he says he might have used the other radio\n",

Kondolay does not recall seeing any other vehicles in the location of the curve where the accident occurred. In particular, there was no vehicle between his truck and Sangha's (which suggests that Koster may have seen Kondolay's truck begin to slide, rather than Sangha's). When he learned of the accident, he unhitched the trailer from his vehicle in the parking lot of a restaurant some kilometres north of the accident scene, and drove back to the scene. He parked about 300 meters from the accident and thought the travelled road at that point was slippery. As he walked toward the accident he saw a police officer slip and fall\n",

At trial he denied receiving a radio warning from Kondolay but on his examination for discovery he acknowledged that as he approached the scene of the accident he had been warned that the curve was slippery. As he went into the curve, Sangha lost control of his vehicle and it spun around completely and went off the highway into the ditch on the east side of the road.

It had been snowing through the early morning and was still snowing lightly. Thiels says that he had no problems at all driving through the day. As he approached the scene he thought that the road was clear and the visibility was good but there was little sand or salt on the road at the scene. He was approaching the accident scene at approximately 75 to 80 km/hour on a slight uphill. He suddenly saw Sangha's super B rig coming at him backwards. To avoid a collision he had no option but to put his vehicle into the ditch on the west side of the road. He believes that he had only a second to react.

He says that it was snowing large wet flakes as he drove towards the accident scene and that road conditions were bad between Quesnel and the accident scene. He could drive no faster than 80 km/hour and had to drive slower than that in order to cover the six to seven kilometres to the scene. He did not see any road maintenance vehicles before getting to the scene of the accident. When he stepped from his vehicle at the scene, he slipped and fell.

He returned to the scene and arrived after police and other emergency personnel and therefore at least 20 minutes after the accident. He took a series of photographs which were entered into evidence, to which most witnesses were referred. These photos demonstrate that by 20 minutes after the accident there was a light skiff of snow on top of the travelled portion of the roadway. Given that it was snowing before and sometime after the accident, the photographs support the evidence of the number of witnesses that the travelled road surface was for the most part bare at the time of the accident. The photographs also demonstrate the presence of abrasive material on and around the roadway. This is not disputed by anyone. The question is whether what is seen in the photograph are remnants of old or recent sanding of the road.\n",

      "\n",
      "22  Andrushko testified to the contractual relationship between HMC and the Crown, and the obligations assumed by HMC. He identified Highway 97 as a class \"A\" highway, requiring the highest standard of maintenance. That standard requires HMC to patrol Highway 97 at least every four hours and to respond within two hours to known hazards. HMC is contractually obliged to respond to an accumulation of four centimetres of snow in travelled lanes on class \"A\" highways\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "23  Andrushko described the system in place to learn of bad weather and hazards. He reviewed the weather records and the forecasts received by HMC. These indicate that for most of the day of January 17, it was contemplated that the following day, the 18th, would see low temperatures of minus nine climbing to minus two in the afternoon. It was anticipated that there would be light snow in the morning followed by freezing rain in the afternoon. At 9:30 a.m. on January 18, HMC received an update from its weather forecasters indicating that they then anticipated five to ten centimetres of snow in all areas between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. It was anticipated that road temperatures would vary between a low of minus seven to a high of minus four in the afternoon. Andrushko described the policy of HMC with respect to the application of abrasives and salt, and the rationale for that policy. Salt is not used on the roads if snow is expected or if it is anticipated that temperatures will not rise above minus six degrees. In the circumstances of this case, HMC did not intend to apply salt to the roads because of anticipated snowfall. Additional employees were called in to work during the day shift of January 18 to plough and sand the roads\n",

      "24  Haldorson described regular patrolling and sanding on the night before the accident. His evidence is not essential to the case of any party. The evidence of Maglio, however, is critical. Maglio was described by his employers as a very conscientious individual. He left the HMC works yard north of Quesnel at 5:15 am on January 18, 2007. He drove through Quesnel to a point three kilometres north of the accident scene, where he began his regular patrol. That patrol called for him to drive south on Highway 97, a distance of approximately 45 km to a point known as the Cairn Site and to then turn north and return to the starting point. Occasionally along this circular route, which he repeated during the day, he stopped to load sand into his truck. It is Maglio's evidence that he spent about two thirds of his time on that date ploughing and one third of his time sanding roads. It was his practice to sand hills and corners but not to sand flat straight sections of the highway. He says he certainly would have sanded the \"S\" curve on each occasion when he passed it. He passed the scene of the accident heading south at about 5:30 a.m.; heading north at about 8:00 a.m.; heading south again at about 8:10 a.m.; heading north again at 10:30 a.m.; and heading south again at 10:40 a.m. The records indicate that he used three truckloads of sand during the course of the day. There was no significant cross-examination of Maglio other than the suggestion that he had no specific recollection of which section of the road he sanded. His testimony of an invariable practice of sanding curves and hills was not challenged on cross-examination.\n",

Her daughter remained with her after the separation until she was seven or eight years old, when she moved to Fort St. John to be with her brother and father. During some of that period Ms. Harrington was on social assistance. Upon the departure of her daughter in about 1990, Ms. Harrington moved to Edmonton and obtained employment.

When she did so her wrist problems settled and she resumed most of her usual activities. By 2004 she had been promoted to customer service supervisor. Her reported income from employment that year was $23,061. That was the only year in her life she had ever earned more than $18,000. She took a 3 month leave of absence in 2005 and then returned to customer service (although not as a supervisor) until February 1, 2006. She earned about $18,000 in 2005.

She claimed to have had arrangements in place to care of four children after school and two children overnight. She anticipated that she would earn $162 per day. She had not sought a business license or obtained insurance.

She had suffered from depression as a result of abuse, resulting in a psychiatric admission to hospital at age 18. There is evidence that she had some ongoing struggles with depression. She suffered from episodes of depression in 2004 and 2005 for which she sought treatment. The October 2004 depression was thought to have been having some cognitive effects.

She underwent a long and unsuccessful operation to repair the brachial plexus, performed by Dr. Thomas Zwimpfer on October 22, 2007, and a later, successful but very painful tendon transfer procedure, to restore elbow flexion, performed by Dr. Thomas Goetz (\"Dr. Goetz\") on September 8, 2009. She was very sensitive to movement that caused pain for many months following that operation. That tendon transfer procedure was successful in enabling her to lift her left arm to a ninety-degree angle without assistance. However her left arm is still of very limited use to her. Because of overuse, she now gets throbbing in her right forearm and elbow. She has headaches daily which she associates with pain in her neck and back, and with stress. She has lower back spasms. She is left with scarring where tendon grafting has occurred and has lost sensation over large areas of her neck and chest.

She tended to simple tasks around their apartment home but was slow in doing so. He considered her short term memory to be very bad. She left keys in the car and forgot to turn off lights. He found her very emotional and very stressed while caring for small children, which she did occasionally when she lived with him\n",

      "61  The parties called two experts in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation. Dr. Jubert Anton (\"Dr. Anton\") examined Ms. Harrington on June 22, 2010, and provided a report to plaintiff's counsel on the same date. Dr. Nittin K. Reebye (\"Dr. Reebye\") examined Ms. Harrington on December 2010 and provided a report for counsel for Sangha on January 4, 2011\n",

      "62  Dr. Anton concluded that Ms. Harrington has suffered an injury to the upper trunk of the left brachial plexus resulting in the development of a neuroma-in-continuity. He says that following the successful tendon transfer to restore elbow flexion performed by Dr. Goetz on September 8, 2009, Ms. Harrington continued to have very little movement of the left shoulder and was unable to lift her left arm at the shoulder or to bring it forward or bring it behind her. Although she has good strength in the left hand, the weakness in the left shoulder will make it difficult for her to use her left hand functionally in any day-to-day activities. She was also left with sensory impairment in the left arm. The brachial plexus injury is causing chronic pain of the left arm, shoulder and hand, which in Dr. Anton's opinion is partly neuropathic (arising from nerve injury) and in part nociceptive (arising from noxious stimuli). Dr. Anton does not foresee any neurological recovery of the brachial plexus\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  Ms. Harrington had suffered a traumatic brain injury which Dr. Anton describes as a \"complicated mild traumatic injury\" or \"a moderately severe traumatic brain injury\". The criteria used by Dr. Anton to describe the severity of the brain injury include the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score after her injury, the duration of post-traumatic amnesia and the presence of evidence of physical injury to the brain. Evidence of the latter was found in the reports of Dr. David Fenton (\"Dr. Fenton\") on an MRI taken June 17, 2009. That study demonstrated low density changes in the interior left frontal lobe, suggestive of previous hemorrhagic shear injury. That evidence of diffuse axonal injury was thought by Dr. Anton to be consistent with the deficits demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. He testified that recovery after traumatic brain injury is maximal in the first two years following injury and that persistent deficits arising from traumatic brain injury are now unlikely to improve. Whether the brain injury is characterized as \"mild, complicated\" or \"moderate\" is immaterial for our purposes, according to Dr. Anton, as both types of injuries have the same prognosis for permanent deficits\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  Dr. Anton says that as a result of her brain injury there is a 4% chance that Ms. Harrington will develop post-traumatic seizures. She is at increased risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease. She is left with reduced cerebral reserves. She is likely to suffer depression as a result of her injury. Frontal lobe injuries are likely to affect executive functioning, such as planning, and the understanding of the consequences of behaviour and, hence, lead to disinhibition and emotional problems\n",

Ms. Harrington reported headaches that were likely post-traumatic. She was suffering from right-shoulder arm and hand pain that was probably, at least in part, myofascial. It is possible that Ms. Harrington is developing arthritic changes in her right hand. Such arthritic changes, in Dr. Anton's opinion, may be accelerated by increased use of and reliance upon the right hand\n",

      "66  Dr. Anton says that Ms. Harrington will require assistance with household tasks, including home maintenance. He says that while she has not yet reached the point of maximum medical improvement, further significant improvement is now unlikely and she will not improve to the point where she is competitively employable\n",

      "67  He recommends a regular review of an exercise program by a physiotherapist, the assistance of a kinesiologist or personal trainer, regular occupational therapy until a plateau is reached, and intermittent assistance thereafter, the appointment of a case manager to assist with gaining access to medical and community services, consultation with a recreational therapist, and psychological counselling. He disagrees with and rejects Dr. Reebye's view that it is enough to train Ms. Harrington to do exercises. He says her exercise needs are complex and will need ongoing reassessment as those needs change through her life. Dr. Anton says that as she encounters difficulties in the future, depression will affect her ability to make good decisions on her own behalf and she will need assistance of an occupational therapist and perhaps a case manager (although he says that an occupational therapist may be able to fill the case manager role)\n",

      "69  With respect to the prognosis, Dr. Anton says there is some possibility of an improvement in the functional outcome if Ms. Harrington's problems other than the traumatic brain injury, which he now regards as irreversible, can be resolved or ameliorated. He concludes, however, that she is probably now at the point of maximal medical improvement and that her current needs are likely to continue\n",

      "70  Dr. Reebye describes the brachial plexus injury in a similar fashion and also concludes that Ms. Harrington's left arm function will be permanently limited. He is also of the view that Ms. Harrington is suffering from chronic neuropathic pain as a result of the brachial plexus injury and that pain will be hard to treat. Dr. Reebye says Ms. Harrington suffers from tenderness in her low back and sacroiliac regions. He does not believe that Ms. Harrington is at risk of developing a seizure disorder. Ms. Harrington has reached maximum level of improvement for her physical deficits and further improvements will be minor\n",

      "71  Dr. Reebye says cognitive deficits are mainly with short-term memory and that while these alone do not make her totally unemployable, the combination of cognitive deficits and problems with her left arm and chronic pain and the use of medication make it more difficult for her to hold a full time competitive job. Dr. Reebye says that Ms. Harrington has the ability to start working in sheltered situations part-time and gradually increase that sheltered work. He says that there is a potential for more work activities over time\n",

      "72  He concludes that the cognitive deficits caused by the traumatic brain injury are permanent but that some deficits are likely be caused by chronic pain and use of medication and emotional problems, and that those will improve if the chronic pain is resolved, if medication can be reduced and if the emotional problems are resolved. He says the emotional problems stem from chronic pain and difficult adjustment to the alteration of her lifestyle\n",

      "73  Dr. Reebye agrees that Ms. Harrington will have to engage in regular exercise program and that occasional review of her program by a physiotherapist or kinesiologist would be helpful, but he would prefer to see less intrusive involvement in Ms. Harrington's ongoing exercise in physiotherapy than recommended by some of the experts. He suggests that she is capable of learning to manage her own rehabilitation. He does not believe that a professional case manager is required because he believes that her cognitive deficits are not significant enough to warrant a case manager. He does not believe that Ms. Harrington requires a one-on-one rehabilitation assistant but he says that occasional review of her needs by a therapist or other caregiver will be appropriate\n",

Despite expressing that opinion with respect to the home care required, he acknowledged in cross-examination that this opinion is not informed by careful review of her needs and is founded upon his view that she was in fact receiving six hours per week of assistance and that was proving to be adequate. In fact she was receiving more assistance and it was still inadequate.\n",

The experts acknowledge that consistent results have been obtained on neuropsychological testing, despite variations in the level of the plaintiff's pain and her emotional state and that the deficits demonstrated on neuropsychological tests are consistent with an organic brain injury. That is some evidence that the organic brain injury is a large component in the plaintiff's functional difficulties\n",

      "78  Dr. Reebye places significant weight on the patient's presentation as an alert, well oriented and fluent person, who was a good historian demonstrating minimal cognitive deficits on examination. He also appears to have placed some weight upon her successful performance of a mini-mental status examination. He expresses the conclusion that Ms. Harrington has attended therapies and seen caregivers regularly and is independent in activities of daily living. There is some inconsistency between Dr. Reebye's description of her high level of independence and the evidence of the lay witnesses summarised above\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "79  Dr. Anton and Dr. Reebye are both of the view that Ms. Harrington's cognitive deficits are multifactorial. A significant contributor to those deficits is traumatic brain injury. She is also affected by pain, medication, depression, lack of sleep and anxiety. The experts agree that she should be weaned from opioids, if possible, because they are not effective in treating neuropathic pain and short-acting medication is generally risky. The experts also agree, however, that it is hard to tease out what can be addressed from what cannot be addressed in the causes of Ms. Harrington's cognitive deficits. Chronic pain management programs, according to Dr. Anton, are for adaptation but not elimination of pain. Dr. Reebye agrees that people with brain injuries, such as Ms. Harrington have a much higher risk of psychiatric disorders, anxiety and depression as and when they become aware of their deficits\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  There appears to be general agreement amongst the experts that Ms. Harrington is currently disabled from competitive employment as a result of her cognitive deficits, the loss of use of her left arm and her chronic pain. They also agree that the cognitive deficits from which she suffers are somewhat blurred by her chronic pain, her medication use and depression. Dr. Reebye, like Dr. Paul Janke (\"Dr. Janke\"), believes that the plaintiff has the capacity to manage a simple physical therapy, recreation and employment program with the regular assistance of an occupational therapist but no other consultants. The only prospect for future employment held out by Dr. Reebye hinges upon some improvement in the plaintiff's depression, some reduction in her reliance on narcotic medication and some reduction in her chronic pain.\n",

She was reassessed by Dr. Anderson on August 30, 2010, and that reassessment resulted in a report dated September 8, 2010\n",
      "======\n",

      "82  Following his initial interview and examination of the records, on March 9, 2009, Dr. Anderson was of the view that Ms. Harrington had developed physical, cognitive and emotional difficulties as a result of the motor vehicle accident. He described her brain injury as being of mild to moderate severity. Despite suggestions by others, he felt that she had not suffered post-traumatic stress disorder because post-traumatic amnesia prevented her from having terrible memories of the trauma causing her injury and her psychiatric symptoms were not sufficient to lead to that diagnosis. He felt that Ms. Harrington's depressive symptoms overlapped with symptoms due to chronic pain and anxiety but he did not believe that she had suffered a major depressive disorder. He described her condition as a chronic adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. Her adjustment was due to the disability caused by her physical injury and the cognitive difficulty she experienced as a result of her brain injury\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  When he later saw Ms. Harrington, on August 30, 2010, Dr. Anderson was of the view that the evidence of cognitive deficit on neuropsychological testing and the evidence of brain density changes on the CT scan justified the conclusion that Ms. Harrington had suffered a brain injury of moderate severity. He remained of the view that Ms. Harrington was suffering from a chronic adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and not a major depressive episode\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  Dr. Anderson noted that Ms. Harrington demonstrated some signs of cognitive impairment in her dealings with him. She was disinhibited and on her second assessment forgot that she had previously seen him and spoken with him extensively about her case.

He agreed with the recommendation that Ms. Harrington have assistance from an occupational therapist and that her exercise should be directed by a kinesiologist or experienced personal trainer. He did not agree with the suggestion that Ms. Harrington must develop independence and will benefit from a minimal level of therapy. He agreed that independence is an objective of therapy but expressed the view that regular therapy will facilitate involvement in social and recreational activities and will not be so frequent as to impinge upon Ms. Harrington's independence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  On the issue of causation, Dr. Anderson agreed that it is impossible to parse out the effects of depression, pain, medication and brain injury on the plaintiff's cognitive abilities. In his opinion, however, the predominant cause of these difficulties, as described by neuropsychologic testing, is the brain injury. First, the deficits found on testing and the emotional difficulties reported were \"classic\" consequences of a head injury. Second, the deficits found on testing were consistent over time, despite fluctuations in medications and levels of pain and the emotional consequences of that pain. Last, the psychological illness diagnosed by Dr. Anderson and others, an adjustment disorder, is not usually associated with any significant cognitive problems. He agreed that the pre-accident history provided to him by the patient suggested that she was emotionally vulnerable but thought it was significant that, despite a traumatic childhood and difficulties in adult life, she had not developed any major psychiatric problems before the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "87  With respect to the prognosis, it was Dr. Anderson's view that there is no significant prospect for improvement of the brain injury, more than two years post-accident. There is some prospect of improvement of the symptoms arising from the adjustment disorder but that prospect is slight, given that it is associated with chronic pain. There is also some prospect that learned techniques for dealing with emotional problems and memory deficits will improve her day-to-day functioning. For that reason he recommends significant continuing psychological counselling, occupational therapy and exercise. Over time there may be some improvement in her cognition but it is likely, in Dr. Anderson's view, to be minimal\n",

Dr. Bishop examined the test results and prepared a report dated July 20, 2009, which is in evidence. Although there is some uncertainty with respect to this question, given the absence of pre-accident testing or other useful data, she was of the view that Ms. Harrington may have suffered mild suppression of global intellect as a result of her brain injury. The tests performed demonstrated difficulties with psychomotor processing speed, verbally-mediated learning and recall for non-contextual information. Dr. Bishop thought she demonstrated persistent visual learning and memory impairment of at least moderate severity and selectively impaired attention capacity for higher-order complex attentional challenges. Her visual memory was felt to be \"frankly impaired\". She demonstrated some irritability and mild verbal disinhibition.

Dr. Janke felt she met the criteria for a diagnosis of mild post-traumatic stress disorder and that she was presenting sufficient symptoms of depression to justify a diagnosis of mild to moderate depression. He felt her memory impairment was relatively mild and was not apparent in the context of the clinical interview. However, he did not have the results of neuropsychological testing. He felt that appropriate self-management of pain by Ms. Harrington would markedly reduce the impact of the pain on her daily functioning and would almost certainly improve her mood\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "97  In his first report, Dr. Janke made no attempt to describe the nature and extent of the impairment arising from the traumatic brain injury. In describing her difficulties with short term memory, he wrote: \"it does not appear that this has shown significant improvement over time which is not consistent with the typical course following a mild traumatic brain injury\". That observation is inconsistent with the evidence of the lay witnesses and Dr. Janke's own record of Ms. Harrington's evidence. At p. 3 of appendix A of his report he noted: \"Ms. Harrington states in the first six months following the accident she was repeating herself a great deal and that her memory was quite a bit worse. She states that there has been improvement over time.\" He later notes that she reported that she had felt suicidal in the past but after counselling states that she now \"tries to keep her head from going there\". It was only after lengthy and pressing cross-examination on this issue at trial that Dr. Janke agreed that the pattern of recovery demonstrated by Ms. Harrington following her traumatic brain injury is, in fact, consistent with an organic injury. It is now acknowledged that Ms. Harrington had a moderate or complicated mild traumatic brain injury with evidence of damage due to micro-hemorrhages in the frontal lobe of her brain and that there is evidence of gradual recovery from significant memory problems consistent with recovery from that traumatic brain injury\n",

He also agrees that the deficit discerned on testing is consistent with a traumatic brain injury. The results of the neuropsychological testing tell us what Ms. Harrington's capacity is but, in Dr. Janke's view, they are not of assistance in parsing out the effect on her cognitive skills of the brain injury, as distinct from the effects of chronic pain, emotional dysfunction and medications. Having said that, the most Dr. Janke could say with respect to the prognosis is that while the physical and neurological deficits are permanent, the plaintiff's ability to cope with pain and her reliance upon medication may be addressed in a manner that leads to some improvement in her cognitive functioning.\n",

Operation of a daycare business would have been a suitable occupation for her even assuming that she did have any or all of the pre-morbid medical problems that we identified. She also likely had other pre-morbid employment options in the sales and service sector 2, although she may have required a sympathetic employer willing to accommodate her need for frequent washroom breaks and or time off. She presents to this vocational assessment with very little vocational rehabilitation potential. Indeed I cannot foresee her working in any occupation, even on a non-competitive basis with a sympathetic employer\n",

Landy prepared a report and assessment of Ms. Harrington's needs on the basis of the expert reports and an interview on assessment of Ms. Harrington conducted in her home in Abbotsford, British Columbia, on July 26, 2010. In part the life care plan is based upon Landy's own assessment of the plaintiff's needs, in part it is based upon the opinions expressed in other experts' reports. She identifies the following future care needs:\n",

She said that the standard rate charged by classic caregivers for such services is $21.75 per hour plus HST, an amount in the range of $25.00 per hour in total. In cross-examination she acknowledged that while homemaking assistance can be had for $15 per hour, it is in the interest of a patient requiring long-term care to pay the significantly higher fee charged by an agency so as to have continuity of care and not to have to worry about finding replacements on a permanent or temporary basis. The agency employer can also ensure that the work is being performed to appropriate standards. The difference between rates charged by classic caregivers and the rate used by Landy as the basis for her assessment arises principally from the fact that Classic Caregivers uses non-union employees, is not accredited and does not do government work.\n",

They have provided the court with multipliers for use in calculating the net present value of income lost before trial and the net present value of a loss of income or income earning capacity in the future. The experts, Mr. Robert Carson (\"Carson\") of Associated Economic Consultants Ltd. and Mr. Douglas Hildebrand (\"Hildebrand\") of Columbia Pacific Consulting have been most helpful to the court in describing the significant variables that will affect the calculation of these potential losses. Most significantly in this case they are:\n",
      "what category of income earner should be used as an appropriate measure of the plaintiff's potential income earning capacity as a child care provider or a daycare centre operator;\n",
      "whether in calculating loss of future income or income earning capacity the court should discount any prospect of continued employment after age 65;\n",
      "whether estimates of past and future income earning capacity should include a contingency to reflect the possibility that the plaintiff will voluntarily withdraw from the work force or seek only part-time work; and\n",

They agree that the net present value of a stream of funds necessary to pay $1,000 of expenses for the balance of the plaintiff's normal life expectancy is $20,648. Hildebrand points out that this figure should not be used to calculate the present value of the cost of care that is not required, or is not compensable for the balance of the plaintiff's lifetime. So, for example, a lower multiplier (14.572) should be used to calculate the present value of a stream of funds to age 65\n",

He described the requirement that Canada Revenue Agency documentation be provided by an applicant to confirm family income. He described the deductibles applicable and the manner in which they are calculated in relation to income. He confirmed that it is the government policy that individuals who require prescription medication as a result of an injury for which they have a claim arising out of a motor vehicle accident are not eligible to claim PharmaCare benefits in relation to such expenses. Residents of the province are not covered for medications directly associated with negligence in respect of which there is a potential claim for compensation. If an individual receives compensation for medical expenses, then no payment will be made by the PharmaCare program\n",

Mr. Moneo agreed with the suggestion that there may be individuals who do not report their claims or recovery and that therefore are compensated twice, once by a tortfeasor and once by PharmaCare for prescription expenses. However, he also identified the clear written policy guidelines that disentitle the plaintiff to PharmaCare benefits in this case.\n",

      "... it would appear that apart from some specific exemption, arising from a statutory provision or established common law principle, a duty of care was owed by the province to those that use its highways. That duty of care would extend ordinarily to reasonable maintenance of those roads. The appellant as a user of the highway was certainly in sufficient proximity to the respondent to come within the purview of that duty of care. In this case it can be said that it would be eminently reasonable for the appellant as a user of the highway to expect that it would be reasonably maintained.

All of these factors should be taken into account in determining whether the system was adopted in bona fide exercise of discretion and whether within that system the frequency, quality and manner of inspection were reasonable.\n",

Once a duty of care that is not exempted has been established the trial will determine whether the government agency has met the requisite standard of care.

The law does not impose a higher standard of care upon contractors than the courts would impose upon the Crown, simply because of the provisions of the contract. The contract may, however, set the upper limit of the standard of care owed by the public to the contractor.

Thiels says that he is entitled to assume that other drivers will adhere to the rules of road.

I am satisfied on the evidence of Thiels that he exercised his professional judgment with respect to an appropriate speed in which he could travel.

The standard to be imposed upon the contractor is not a standard of perfection but, at most, that set out in its contract. I cannot find in the evidence before me that there was a breach of the contract or a failure to comply with any of its significant terms.

The inference of speed may be drawn from the close contact over many miles between the vehicles involved in this collision. It is not necessary in my view for me to make a finding with respect to the speed at which the plaintiff's vehicle was travelling immediately before the accident. Ms. Harrington did not lose control of her vehicle before the collision. Nor was she warned, as was Sangha, of the approaching danger. Nor was she driving an inherently unstable vehicle that was known to be difficult to control. Ms. Harrington's evidence was that she was driving a vehicle with relatively new studded snow tires. A speed that was safe for her vehicle may have been inherently unsafe for the Sangha vehicle. The admission of liability on the part of Sangha must be said to arise from all of the circumstances in this case and may include his failure to heed the warning that was not available to Ms. Harrington, leading to a loss of control of his vehicle\n",

As noted, she did not lose control. There is no evidence that if she was travelling slower she would have been able to avoid the collision with Thiels' trailer while it sped toward her in her lane of travel. There is no evidence that the speed at which he was travelling contributed to the accident. The plaintiff argued, that Ms. Harrington could have swung to the right, seeing the approaching trailer and that there was some available space on the travelled roadway through which she might have driven to avoid a collision. That criticism calls upon Ms. Harrington to exercise fine judgment in the moment of peril. To attempt that manoeuvre might have risked a loss of control, leading to a more significant collision. Pulling quickly to the right might have exposed both Ms. Harrington and her daughter to greater injury. I cannot say that she was negligent in failing to avoid the collision in this case.\n",

There is no doubt with respect to the extent of her physical injuries. There is convincing evidence that she has suffered a traumatic brain injury. That injury has affected her cognition and may have reduced her global intelligence. There is ample evidence from her family and friends that her behaviour has been significantly affected. She is irritable and disinhibited. Her memory and concentration are poor. These changes are typical of those experienced by people who have suffered frontal lobe injuries of the sort sustained by Ms. Harrington. She is affected by chronic pain and headaches. She requires significant medication to deal with her pain and that has further impacted her emotional state and her intellectual functioning. By all accounts she is now unemployable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "184  Fortunately, she is still largely independent and capable. As the defendants point out, she appears, to the casual observer and even to trained professionals on first encounter, to be someone who is functioning well and behaving appropriately. She is still capable of enjoying many of the amenities of life and may do so to a greater extent if she benefits from certain of the chronic pain management programs recommended to her\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "185  It is true, as the plaintiff submits, that there is no \"range\" of devastating injuries. All devastating injuries should attract an award of general damages at the upper limit permissible. I am of the view, however, that while Ms. Harrington will be seriously affected for the balance of her life by the significant injury she sustained, her injury cannot properly be described as devastating. Unlike the plaintiff in Morrison v. Cormier Vegetation Control, she is not limited to minimal participation in the activities of daily living. She is unlikely to be shunned and the range of relationships open to her should not be forever limited. She appears, still, to have reasonable insight into her situation and condition and has in fact formed relationships since her accident. By suggesting an award that is marginally less than the upper limit, the plaintiff's counsel implicitly acknowledges that this is not a case where the rough upper limit of general damages is an appropriate award\n",

There is no reference in the defendant's submissions to the common findings of the neuropsychologists with respect to the nature and extent of the consequences of the head injury. Nor is there any reference to the testimony of the many family and friends who testified with respect to the dramatic change in the plaintiff's behaviour. Taking into account both the very significant limitations in her physical activities associated with her brachial plexus injury and the functional impact of her head injury, I am of the view that general damages in this case should be assessed at $210,000.\n",

That amount is discounted for income tax to a net loss of $29,325 from which the defendants would deduct advances, leaving a net claim of $17,000 for past income loss\n",

      "190  At the time of her injury the plaintiff had planned to begin to provide child care services to friends and neighbours. While there is some doubt with respect to whether that plan would have succeeded, she was motivated by the termination of her employment insurance benefits to find some employment. It is true that she had been unemployed for a long period of time, as suggested by the defendants, but while she was on employment insurance the motivation to find other work was not high and she was further affected by the death of her mother and other emotional circumstances which had significantly resolved before the motor vehicle accident. Given her long prior history of employment and continuous earnings in the range of $18,000, with exceptional earnings above that amount in 2004, I am of the view that the past loss of income should be assessed on the basis that there is a reasonable prospect that the plaintiff could have obtained employment that would eventually have paid her an amount in the range of $18,000 per annum, had her child care not panned out\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "191  Ms. Harrington's income would likely have been below that level for a period of time while she attempted to get her daycare facility up and running. I therefore, assess the plaintiff's past loss of income earning capacity on the basis that as a daycare operator she might have earned an amount equivalent to that normally earned by babysitters, nannies and parents' helpers: $16,418 in the year from February 2007 to February 2008 and, thereafter to trial, income in the range of $18,000 per annum. The plaintiff would certainly have been affected by both positive and negative contingencies during this period of time. She might have earned little as a daycare operator. She might have been unemployed for a period of time following an attempt to operate a daycare if she was unsuccessful. She might, as she suggested, have moved to the lower mainland and found work here in a casino at an income higher than $18,000 per annum. I am of the view that the negative contingencies, particularly the risk of some lengthy period of unemployment or difficulty finding work, would marginally have outweighed the positive contingencies. The amount that I will award for past income loss is, therefore, marginally less than the sum of $16,500 in 2007 and $18,000 per annum in subsequent years to trial. I am of the view that a reasonable award for loss of past income earning capacity is the sum of $62,000 less the agreed upon advances to the plaintiff.\n",

Using Carson's actuarial tables the plaintiff calculates the current value of that loss at $374,325. To this sum the plaintiff would add 10 percent to account for non-wage benefits and then reduce the claim by 10 percent to account for the contingency of involuntary non-participation in the work force. The plaintiff claims a future loss of capacity of $375,000\n",

Using Carson's multiplier, the present value of that income stream would amount to $289,400. Discounting that figure by approximately 39 percent to account for all labour market contingencies, the defendants reduce the claim for future income earning capacity further to $176,820. The defendants would have the court then make an allowance for the prospect of some residual earning capacity, further reducing the award by 33 percent to $113,900\n",

      "194  With the exception of the period immediately preceding her injury, when she was on employment insurance, the plaintiff was continuously employed for many years prior to 2007. Her average annual income, while employed, was in excess of $18,000 per annum. It is, in my view, entirely unrealistic to assess the plaintiff's loss of income earning capacity, as the defendants do, on the basis that if she had not been injured she would have earned no more than the amount earned, on average, by babysitters, nannies and parents' helpers. Individuals employed in daycares as daycare owners and operators earn, on average, substantially more. On the other hand, it is also unrealistic to suggest, as the plaintiff does, that the starting point for the assessment of her loss of income earning capacity is the calculation of the net present value of a lifetime stream of earnings at $25,000 per annum. Bearing in mind inflation to trial and the one year in which her earnings at the Casino were in the range of $24,000 per annum, I am of the view that the starting point for the assessment of future earning capacity is the net present value of a stream of earnings in the range of $22,000 per annum, including benefits\n",

      "\n",
      "195  I reject Carson's suggestion that in estimating the net present value of that stream of earnings, we should exclude from the calculation the discount that arises from the application of standard non-participation rates. While there is at present no reason to believe that at the time of her injury the plaintiff was intending to voluntarily leave the labour force, the future is, of course, unpredictable and the statistical probability of some absences from the work force should be included in the calculation use as a rough measurement of the loss\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "196  On the other hand, I reject Hildebrand's suggestion that the calculation of the net present value of the lifetime stream of earnings should exclude any allowance for earnings after age 65. The standard calculation of the net present value of a stream of earnings discounts earnings in each year to reflect the possibility of early retirement and non-participation in the workforce. Just as the calculation reflects the significant possibility that the plaintiff might have retired before age 65, so it should include an allowance for the statistical probability that the plaintiff would have continued to work after age 65. The assessment of damages in this case is not based on the assumption that, had she not been injured, the plaintiff would have been working in an industry or at an occupation where there is a traditional, standard or compulsory retirement age\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "197  In my view on the evidence the most accurate picture of Ms. Harrington's loss will be obtained by using her historic earnings as a basis for the appraisal of the loss and estimating of her pre-accident potential future earnings net of part-time work and unemployment. If one begins with an estimate derived from net annual income then, as Hildebrand acknowledges, it is inappropriate to use a multiplier that again factors into the present value calculation a negative contingency that has already been taken into account. On the other hand, the estimate must, in my view, take into account the possibility that due to marriage or another relationship, assistance from her children or some unforeseen event reflected in the statistics, the plaintiff might at some point have withdrawn from the labour force. Some weight should be given, in this estimate, to the plaintiff's pre-existing medical problems. It certainly cannot be said that there was no real and substantial prospect that she would be out of the labour force at some point during her remaining working life. Given her circumstances, her need to support herself, her absence of means and the fact that she is past her child-bearing years, I am not convinced, however, that the contingency for non-participation should be as high as the statistical average for all women similarly situated. For that reason, I would use a multiplier less than the actuarial multiplier of 14.973 but higher than Hildebrand's suggested multipliers that include very significant allowances for part time work and unemployment. For the purposes of an initial estimate of the loss to age 65, I would use a multiplier of 12.5\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "198  That multiplier may understate the loss because it makes no allowance for the statistical possibility of continued employment after age 65. Given that the tables used by the experts to calculate the multipliers do make allowances for the statistical possibility of retirement before age 65 there is, in my view, no basis for not also taking into account the prospect that a person might work after age 65. In fact, there is no reason other than the shortage of statistical evidence referred to by Carson, why the net present value of the lost stream of earnings should not be calculated over a plaintiff's remaining lifetime\n",

I must make some allowance for that contingency if there is a real and substantial possibility that the plaintiff can earn income from employment. There is on the evidence no doubt that the plaintiff is currently not competitively employable. There is also no doubt that there is not going to be any improvement in her ability to use her left arm or any further recovery from her brain injury. She is likely to continue to suffer from chronic pain. She is likely to continue to require medication. Even if her cognitive function can be modestly improved by changes in her medication, or by pain management, she will continue to face the major obstacles to employment that affect her now. The evidence of a prospect of improvement in her condition is speculative and uncertain. Given her physical limitations alone, which will not improve, I am of the view that there is no real and substantial prospect of her return to gainful employment.

      "203  The plaintiff seeks an award to compensate her for the expenses she is likely to incur to deal with her disability and her pain and suffering and to address loss of the amenities of life. She relies upon the opinions of Drs. Bishop, Anton, Anderson and Ms. Craig in support of the claim to the cost of a case manager to monitor her over time and to ensure appropriate support services are in place, the cost of an occupational therapist to oversee recreational therapists and the cost of a rehabilitation aide to assist with her rehabilitation and exercise regime. She needs homemaking assistance. Medication is necessary to address her chronic pain. She seeks cost of psychological treatment focussing on cognitive behavioural orientation, as recommended by Dr. Bishop. She seeks to recover the cost of care recommended, in particular, by Dr. Anton and Landy.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "204  Dr. Anton says that Ms. Harrington requires assistance with household tasks, including home maintenance and will require additional home support as she ages. Landy recommends that she be provided 10 hours of homemaking assistance weekly for life (at the rate of $30 per hour). It is acknowledged that housekeeping help may be obtained at lower rates if one is willing to bear the cost, and incur the effort, of advertising for and hiring replacements as required but argued that Ms. Harrington should not be required to bear that burden. A claim for $354,744, the capital sum necessary to generate an income stream necessary to pay for 10 hours of housekeeping per week for the balance of the plaintiff's anticipated life, is advanced\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "205  There is no doubt the plaintiff requires assistance with housework as a result of her brachial plexus injury. The defendant's suggestion that she could make do with less than 10 hours assistance per week was not borne out on the evidence. The defendants say $17.50 per hour is a reasonable allowance for the cost of homemaking services but their own witness acknowledged the advantages of the use of a service to supply housekeeping at a rate of $25.00 per hour\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "206  The plaintiff has established a need for assistance arising out of her injury and that she reasonably requires 10 hours assistance per week. I accept the submission that she might, in any event, have required some assistance with housework as she aged but also weigh in the balance the evidence that her injury will accelerate the need for some assistance she might not otherwise have required. I conclude that she is entitled to the sum of $195,000 under this head, approximately the net present value of 10 hours per week at $25.00 per hour ($12,000 per annum) to age 70 (using a multiplier of 16.199).\n",
      "b. One-on-one Rehabilitation Assistanc\n",

      "207  The plaintiff claims the cost of a one-on-one rehabilitation assistant to support a structured program of physical conditioning and participation in recreational activity, at $50.00 per hour for eight hours weekly for 48 weeks per year (an annual expense of $19,200) for life. This expense is said to be necessary to ensure a consistent and safe regime of exercise and physical activity\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "208  The medical witnesses agree that in order to maintain her abilities and to avoid deterioration of her physical skills, Ms. Harrington should engage in a regular exercise program. Occasional review of that program by a physiotherapist or kinesiologist would be helpful. There is disagreement with respect to the extent to which frequent involvement in ongoing exercise and physiotherapy will be constructive or intrusive. Dr. Anton disagrees with Dr. Reebye's view that it is enough to train Ms. Harrington to do exercises. He says her exercise needs are complex and will need ongoing reassessment as those needs change through her life\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "209  The evidence supports the claim to an award under this head; the sole question for determination is what expenditure a reasonably prudent person of means would make in an attempt to obtain and maintain an optimum result following an injury of the sort the plaintiff has suffered. I am of the view that the plan set out in the Landy report (and the Carson calculation of costs) is an overestimate of the expenses that might reasonably be incurred. First, it calls for supervision that is intense and unrelenting. It makes no allowance for Ms. Harrington's obvious intellectual capacity and her ability to manage most of her care. It makes no allowance for the fact that there may be long periods when Ms. Harrington can rely upon a routine regime. It takes no account of the fact that as she ages Ms. Harrington may require more simple and less extensive exercise. For these reasons I am of the view that a reasonable award for the cost of rehabilitation assistance is a lump sum of $75,000. This sum would be sufficient to pay for 8 hours of the assistance of a therapist in planning exercise every month to age 75, but the award is not founded upon the settled view that consultation will take place with that frequency. It may be that Ms. Harrington will see the therapist weekly for a period of time until her regime is then settled, and then see her less frequently. It may be that no consultation or advice is required in some months. As noted above, the assessment of such claims is not intended to be mathematical but is expected to be an approximation of anticipated expenses\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "210  In making an award at variance with the recommendations of some of the expert witnesses I am bearing in mind the caution expressed in Penner v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia,  at para. 13 that \"a little common sense should inform claims under this head [costs of future care], however much they may be recommended by experts in the field.\"\n",
      "c. Psychological and Psychiatric Counsellin\n",

      "211  I accept the evidence of Dr. Anderson that the plaintiff will continue to benefit from psychological consultations and that they should continue at the present rate until the plaintiff has completed two years of intensive counselling. I also accept that it is appropriate for her to attend at 24 sessions in the third year and 6 to 12 sessions of continuing long-term supportive psychotherapy thereafter. In my view the evidence supports his view that regular therapy will facilitate involvement in social and recreational activities. Ms. Harrington will continue to suffer from chronic pain and as a consequence of that and her disability will likely be affected by depression that will vary in severity over time. I am satisfied that she will periodically require psychological or psychiatric counselling when her symptoms are significant. Dr. Janke acknowledges that Ms. Harrington may require anti-depressants indefinitely. Her medication and compliance with therapy will have to be assessed on an ongoing basis\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "212  Ms. Harrington has established a claim for the costs of therapy of $15,750 in the first two tears of treatment; $3,437 in year three; and $33,471 over the balance of her lifetime. From the total of these amounts ($52,658) the parties will make an adjustment to account for payment of any portion of the treatment that had been completed between November 2010, when such therapy was initiated, and the date of trial. They will have leave to speak to the appropriate adjustment if that cannot be agreed to and incorporated by consent in the judgment.\n",

The current Occupational Therapist, Maryanne Noble, also serves as a rehabilitation case manager. This person should oversee the rehabilitation program and also consult with the physicians, the psychologist and the psychiatrist to ensure that treatment plans are co-ordinated and to ensure compliance with prescribed therapies. She would also supervise the provision of services such as housekeeping and exercise planning\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "214  Dr. Anton says that depression is likely to affect Ms. Harrington's ability to make good decisions on her own behalf and she will need assistance of an occupational therapist and case manager (he says that an occupational therapist may be able to fill the case manager role). The defendants say that the plaintiff's claim for ongoing occupational therapy intervention on a regular and continuous basis for the remainder for life is not supported by the medical evidence. Dr. Reebye, agrees that occupational therapy consultation is appropriate but says that such therapy should be tailored to focus on specific attainable goals and is not an ongoing, lifetime requirement. The defendants would allow for 35 sessions with an occupational therapist and an annual check-up to age 80\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "215  Given the nature and extent of the plaintiff's ongoing needs, including housekeeping, physical therapy, exercise and psychological counselling I find that the claim for 24 hours of occupational therapy and case management annually is not unreasonable. $57,770 is, in my view, a reasonable allowance for the expense of that assistance.\n",

Dr. Reebye says that Landy's recommendations for activities of daily living are appropriate and adequate. These costs are allowed at the amounts set out in Table 1 of Carson's Report of November 19, 2010. Account will have to be taken of payment of any portion of the cost of items already purchased for the plaintiff by or on behalf of the defendants.

There is no issue that this expense is medically justified and reasonable. Transportation costs are also allowed at the amounts set out in Table 1 of Carson's Report of November 19, 2010, with appropriate adjustment for payment of any portion of transportation costs by or on behalf of the defendants.

      "219  The plaintiff seeks an award for the cost of retaining an avocational consultant to assist her in finding an appropriate volunteer placement. Dr. Reebye also agrees that the plaintiff should seek some avocational advice, but I see no reason why the occupational consultant cannot fill this role. In any event this expense should properly be regarded, in my view, as a cost incurred to improve the plaintiff's enjoyment of the amenities of life, for which she is compensated by the award of general damages.\n",

There is a fine distinction between the claim for this advice and the claims made for the services of an occupational therapist and case manager and the services of a rehabilitation assistant. Exercising the care described in Cathro v. Davis, , and bearing in mind the award made for occupational consulting and a recreation aide, I find the plaintiff's exercise needs are not so complicated or extensive that the further services of a recreation therapist would be reasonably incurred.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "222  A claim for $130,000 is advanced for the cost of medications the plaintiff is likely to require on an ongoing basis. The defendants would reduce the claim for pharmaceuticals by eliminating the claim for certain medication (Paxil) which accounts for $11,571 of the claim, and which they say is not required or used. The defendants seek, further, to deduct from the claim for pharmaceuticals the support that the plaintiff may be entitled to receive from the Pharmacare program\n",

The Plaintiff says there need be no precise calculation of the value of the award and that the court should make a global award but says that some justification for the award may be found in the evidence that unskilled housework is worth $15 per hour and that, at this rate an in trust award of $10,000 would only account for 83 days of work. The defendants say that only a modest award has been proven by the plaintiff and says that $3,000 would be a reasonable award. In my view there has been much assistance offered to the plaintiff but much of it is not compensable as it is simply the assistance that one might expect to receive from friends and family. The plaintiff did require intensive assistance in late January and through February and March 2007 prior to the provision of services to her by or on behalf of the defendants. In my view a reasonable award for that portion of the assistance she was offered following the accident that is properly compensable is $6,000.\n",

      "33  The defendant stated that as he was travelling downhill there was a curve sloping to his left. Before proceeding downhill, the defendant stated that he changed the manual gearshift in his truck from third gear down to second gear. He stated that the passenger-side tires of his truck were following the grass line (shoulder) on his right hand side of the road. He stated that the window on the driver's side of his truck was rolled down two inches. The defendant said that he did not hear dirt bikes in the vicinity of the accident. Counsel for the plaintiff put the following questions and answers (lines 603 - 606) from his examination for discovery which was held January 13, 2010:\n",
      " Q Your windows were open in the truck? \n",

He described it as a \"blind corner.\" He stated that when he could see past the tree, two motorcycles appeared riding abreast, following grooves in the road. The defendant stated that he held the steering wheel as hard to the right as he could. The defendant stated that Mr. Gaven went to his left and the plaintiff went to his right. Both the plaintiff and the defendant hit the shallow ditch on the defendant's right hand side of the road. At first the defendant did not know where the plaintiff was. Both the plaintiff and the plaintiff's dirt bike were in the ditch.

They were travelling about one foot apart, handlebar to handlebar, and driving between 40 and 50 kilometres per hour as they approached the apex of the corner. Mr. Gaven stated that he was as far to his right as he could be going into the corner. Mr. Gaven's evidence is that he observed the truck's wheels projecting on the side of the dirt and grass; that is the road and shoulder on Mr. Gaven's side of the road. Mr. Gaven stated there was very little shoulder in the area that he was driving. He said everything happened in a \"split second\". The truck was on his right hand side of the road and passed him by a few inches on the driver's side. Mr. Gaven then turned his bike on an angle. He then heard a crash\n",

The plaintiff stated that as he reached the apex of the corner, he was a little less than a foot from Mr. Gaven and that they were travelling at a speed of between 40 to 50 kilometres per hour\n",

The plaintiff states that when he first saw the defendant's truck it was in the middle of the road as it crested the hill, and that the defendant was cutting the corner to the defendant's left side. He stated that Mr. Gaven was on the right hand side of John Park at this time riding an imaginary line dividing the road and shoulder. The plaintiff stated that when he came to the apex of the corner he saw a truck coming down the middle of John Park and coming into Mr. Gaven's side of the road.

He stated that he could not move over to the right as Mr. Gaven was riding there, and to his right and off the shoulder was an incline of bush and trees. The plaintiff said that he saw the shallow ditch on the other side of the road and headed towards it, intending to go around the defendant's truck. He said he was headed towards the ditch at a 45 degree angle. He stated he was about halfway across the road when the truck hit him. The plaintiff and the dirt bike landed in the ditch\n",

The angle at which the photographs were taken do not depict what was seen by the plaintiff and Mr. Gaven as they drove their dirt bikes, nor what the defendant observed as he drove his truck.

In his statement to the adjuster and adopted at his examination for discovery, he stated that when he first saw the defendant's truck it was five to six car-lengths away. He stated that he observed the truck's tire on the edge of the driver's left hand side of the road. In his evidence at trial, the plaintiff drew a red mark, very near some skid marks on a photograph (exhibit \"A\", tab 2, page 9).

      "42  The plaintiff argues that the defendant is 100% responsible for the accident. He argues that the defendant was travelling on the wrong side of the road. When the plaintiff saw the defendant's truck, the plaintiff had no choice but to take evasive action and head towards the left hand side of the road, attempting to go around the truck towards the shallow ditch. The plaintiff argues that he can invoke the \"agony of the moment\" rule set out in Wormell v. Hagen,  at para. 36:\n",
      "The standard of care applied to individuals in emergency situations is not one of perfection. The law in such circumstances was explained in Walls v. Mussens Ltd. et al  at 247-48 (N.B.C.A.):\n",
      "... I think the plaintiff is entitled to invoke the \"agony of the moment\" rule as an answer to the allegation of contributory negligence made against him. The rule is stated by Mr. Glanville Williams in his work Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence at p. 360-1:\n",
      "It is well settled that where a sudden emergency arises through the fault of the defendant, the plaintiff who acts reasonably in an attempt to extricate himself is not guilty of contributory negligence merely because he unintentionally aggravates the situation. Also, where the plaintiff is compelled to make a quick decision in the 'agony of the moment' he is not expected to take into account all the considerations that a calmer appraisal of the situation might present to the mind. Perfect foresight and presence of mind are not required. This rule, sometimes called the 'agony of the moment' rule, is merely a particular application of the rule that the standard of care required of both plaintiff and defendant is that of a reasonable man.\n",
      "The Law of Torts, 3rd ed., by J.G. Fleming contains the following statement at p. 247:\n",
      "On the other hand, a person's conduct in the face of a sudden emergency, cannot be judged from the standpoint of what would have been reasonable behaviour in the light of hind-knowledge and in a calmer atmosphere conducive to a nice evaluation of alternatives. A certain latitude is allowed when in the agony of the moment he seeks to extricate himself from an emergency not created by his own antecedent negligence. The degree of judgment and presence of mind expected of the plaintiff is what would have been reasonable conduct in such a situation, and he will not be adjudged guilty of contributory negligence merely because, as it turns out, he unwittingly took the wrong course.\n",
      "The rule although applied originally in Admiralty cases, now has general application where danger to life and limb or to property is brought about by the negligence of the defendant: see The \"Bywell Castle\" (1879), L.R. 4 P.D. 219 per Brett, L.J., at p. 226, and Cotton, L.J., at p. 228; Rowan v. Toronto Ry. Co. (1899) , and Tatisich v. Edwards, , .\n",
      "The test to be applied in circumstances such as those as in the case at bar is, in my opinion, not whether the plaintiff exercised a careful and prudent judgment in doing what he did, but whether what he did was something an ordinarily prudent man might reasonably have done under the stress of the emergency\n",

That, of course, was an error. In H.M.T.Q. v. Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, , Dickson, J. (as he then was) concludes at pp. 225-6 of the report:\n",
      "Breach of statute, where it has an effect upon civil liability, should be considered in the context of the general law of negligence. Negligence and its common law duty of care have become pervasive enough to serve the purpose invoked for the existence of the action for statutory breach.\n",
      "It must not be forgotten that the other elements of tortious responsibility equally apply to situations involving statutory breach, i.e. principles of causation and damages. To be relevant at all, the statutory breach must have caused the damage of which the plaintiff complains.

      "73  Mr. Justice Groves in Aberdeen v. Langley (Township), , stated:\n",
      "[58] The B.C. Court of Appeal established in Ottosen v. Kasper  (B.C.C.A.) that the apportionment of fault under section 1 of the Negligence Act should be based on the weight of fault that should be attributed to each of the parties, not on the weight of causation. Lambert J.A. based this conclusion on the wording of the Negligence Act, which speaks of \"fault,\" and equated fault with blameworthiness. This approach to apportionment was subsequently confirmed in Cempel, , supra, as follows at paragraph 19:\n",
      "... The Negligence Act requires that the apportionment must be made on the basis of \"the degree to which each person was at fault\". It does not say that the apportionment should be on the basis of the degree to which each person's fault caused the damage. So we are not assessing degrees of causation, we are assessing degrees of fault. In this context, \"fault\" means blameworthiness. So it is a gauge of the amount by which each proximate and effective causative agent fell short of the standard of care that was required of that person in all the circumstances.\n",
      "...\n",
      "[60] Although assessing the relative blameworthiness of the parties is the correct approach, there is some difficulty in quantifying that concept. In this regard, the words of Lambert J.A. in Cempel, supra, at paragraph 24 are instructive:\n",
      "In the apportionment of fault there must be an assessment of the degree of the risk created by each of the parties, including a consideration of the effect and potential effect of occurrences within the risk, and including any increment in the risk brought about by their conduct after the initial risk was created. The fault should then be apportioned on the basis of the nature and extent of the departure from the respective standards of care of each of the parties.\n",
      "[61] Finch J.A. (as he then was) expanded upon the concept of relative fault in Alberta Wheat Pool v. Northwest Pile Driving Ltd. ,  at paragraph 46 as follows:\n",
      "Fault or blameworthiness evaluates the parties' conduct in the circumstances, and the extent or degree to which it may be said to depart from the standard of reasonable care. Fault may vary from extremely careless conduct, by which the party shows a reckless indifference or disregard for the safety of person or property, whether his own or others, down to a momentary or minor lapse of care in conduct which, nevertheless, carries with it the risk of foreseeable harm.\n",
      "[62] Thus, fault is to be determined by assessing the nature and extent of the departure from the standard of care of each of the parties. Relevant factors that courts have considered in assessing relative degrees of fault were summarized by the Alberta Court of Appeal in Heller v. Martens, , supra, at paragraph 34 as follows:\n",
      "The nature of the duty owed by the tortfeasor to the injured person ...\n",
      "The number of acts of fault or negligence committed by a person at fault ...\n",

Hejslet, , the court stated that before comparing cases similar to that of the plaintiff, it is important to consider first the purpose of non-pecuniary damages. Madam Justice Kirkpatrick stated its purpose:\n",
      "[45] Before embarking on that task, I think it is instructive to reiterate the underlying purpose of non-pecuniary damages. Much, of course, has been said about this topic. However, given the not-infrequent inclination by lawyers and judges to compare only injuries, the following passage from Lindal v. Lindal, , supra, at 637 is a helpful reminder:\n",
      "Thus the amount of an award for non-pecuniary damage should not depend alone upon the seriousness of the injury but upon its ability to ameliorate the condition of the victim considering his or her particular situation. It therefore will not follow that in considering what part of the maximum should be awarded the gravity of the injury alone will be determinative. An appreciation of the individual's loss is the key and the \"need for solace will not necessarily correlate with the seriousness of the injury\" (Cooper-Stephenson and Saunders, Personal Injury Damages in Canada (1981), at p. 373). In dealing with an award of this nature it will be impossible to develop a \"tariff\".

After the accident, she immediately underwent surgery and was found to have a compound fracture in the area of the heel bone. There was nerve damage, laceration of tendons and other muscle and soft tissue damage. Damage to the heel bone was irreversible, requiring an ankle fusion as well as screws to hold the fractures in place. Ms. Wozniak suffered excruciating pain and could not weight-bear until approximately three months after the accident. The pins and screws were removed in the fall of 2004; some three or four months after the accident. She does not walk normally, cannot walk for long periods of time, or stand for long periods of time. Her gait is affected, particularly when she tires, which she does easily. Many of her recreational activities have been curtailed because she cannot go places where she cannot sit. She has limited movement in her foot. She has a high risk for developing arthritis.\n",

He was unable to stand for long periods of time due to the skin graft and had difficulty holding things in his left hand due to the amputation.

He was initially confined to a wheelchair, then walked with crutches and eventually a cane. Many of his recreational activities were curtailed, some of which have been curtailed permanently, particularly if they relate to high impact-type activities. He has lost some range of motion in his right ankle which is unlikely to improve. The prognosis for osteoarthritis in the right ankle in the long-term is moderate.

As an example, the plaintiff gave evidence that walking on cement caused discomfort to his ankle and repetitive activities caused some pain in his wrist. It is possible the plaintiff may require further medical attention which will require him to be off work. As an example, it is possible that he may require his ankle to be fused. In the future, he may be a candidate for arthroscopic knee evaluation or surgery, the results of which may limit the plaintiff in his employment or foreclose him from his employment;\n",
      "the plaintiff has lost an advantage of some job opportunities which might be available to him. He is only aged 24.

He had earlier met the plaintiff's mother Faye. They dated for years and married in 1974. Hussack Sr.'s military career took him abroad as well as to various postings in Canada, ending in Chilliwack, B.C. In 1983 he retired from the military, eventually qualifying to receive a disability pension. For a period he worked as an office-accounts manager for a local plumbing and heating company in Chilliwack, and then turned to building houses and running local furniture auctions\n",

Meanwhile Mrs. Hussack continued to work full-time at the local food processing plant. Together the family survived on Hussack Sr.'s military pension and her seasonal factory salary. The food processing plant eventually closed and she went to work as a clerk at Superstore. (She was working at Superstore on the date of the accident). Later she took a medical office assistant course and eventually found employment working in a local seniors' care home\n",

At trial Hussack Sr. rejected the comment in Dr. Lavalle's report that he had reported an intention to divorce his wife and to seek sole custody of Devon. Instead he insisted that in reaction to an argument with his wife, he had simply consulted Dr. Lavalle with a view to seeking a \"favourable report for use in a family situation\". He denied however that there was any live custody dispute. He further denied the comment set out in Dr. Lavalle's report, that he was seeking some advice to address Devon's ongoing refusal to attend school. He insisted there was no problem in this regard since Devon enjoyed going to school. In the end result, he said the attendance on Dr. Lavalle was a waste of both the doctor's time and his own time\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "11  Dr. Lavalle's report (Exhibit 1, Tab 3, p. 48), however, is remarkably prescient in terms of identifying the unhealthy nature of the father-son relationship and its potentially negative effect on Devon's future development. In the report Dr. Lavalle notes:\n",
      "Ernie is over-gratifying, over-protective and over-lenient with his son and I pointed out to him that this was not going to strengthen the child's image of a man ... It is important that he teach the child obedience to authority and that he remains above the generation-line and keeps the child firmly below it. Dad must establish a separate identify in order to be a model for the child to find his own separate identify\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "12  Regarding Devon's refusal to go to school, Dr. Lavalle recommended that Hussack Sr.: \"hold Devon back from school until the child wanted to go really badly and then to lay it on him that he must go every day just like all the other kids. Dad must deliver him there and leave him immediately as he has been told by teachers that the child settles down just as soon as he is gone\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "13  It is notable that just a few months before attending on Dr. Lavalle, Devon gained entry to a new voluntary trial Dual Entry kindergarten program at Vedder Elementary School. From January 1990 until June 1990, a four-year-old child could attend a one-half day kindergarten program. In accordance with the program, the following school year, from September 1990 until June 1991, the child would attend kindergarten for a full day\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "14  Almost from the outset, Devon was late attending his kindergarten class, racking up as many as 17 absences during the first half year program from January until June 1990. In his second kindergarten year, he was absent for 21.5 days. In addition to the absences, he often arrived late, although many of his late arrivals were never recorded\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "15  His kindergarten teacher, Ms. Hands (\"Hands\"), noted that unlike other parents, after delivering Devon to the classroom, Hussack Sr. would linger, remaining in the class even after Devon and the other children were settled for the morning's lessons. In his second year of kindergarten, rather than remain and share lunch and recess with his classmates, Devon left to join his father for lunch, usually at the local Burger King\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  Since Hussack Sr. spent so much time hovering and lingering nearby, Hands suggested he become a school volunteer, hoping that he could find some more positive way of contributing. Hussack Sr., however, continued to hover, adopting behaviours which unnerved other parents and students. He often sat in his van in the school parking lot watching activity on the playground. On occasion, Hands looked up to see him peering through the windows of her ground level classroom\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  Hussack Sr. took steps to draw the attention of Devon's classmates. On various special days or birthdays, Devon was sent to school with lavish toys for display. On the occasion of the year end class picnic, rather than bringing along a frisbee or some such toy, Devon arrived with a fully driveable miniature jeep, equipped with walkie talkies. Two days later he drove the jeep to school and around the parking lot, attracting much attention from other students, but their parents' ire. He attended various other children's birthday parties, presenting very expensive presents which left parents bewildered and complaining to teachers\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  Overall Hands perceived Hussack Sr. as a very overbearing, controlling parent. She viewed Devon's kindergarten years as his first real opportunity to develop friendships, self esteem and \"competency in self\". While Devon developed somewhat emotionally under her watch, from a very shy, sensitive boy, to one better able to interact and speak up in a group, she nevertheless believed his father's behaviour limited his emotional development. In her view, Devon's ability to interact with other children, make friendships and generally experience a sense of independence were all \"stunted\" by his irregular attendance and his father's constant presence. While she met Devon's mother on a couple of occasions, she recalled her as a very timid woman who was effectively uninvolved in Devon's schooling. So far as Hands was concerned the father had assumed control of the parenting\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  In 1991-1992, Ms. Paddy Lawn (\"Lawn\") was Devon's Grade 1 teacher at the same school. Again the same patterns of behaviour emerged. Devon presented as a very cooperative boy, clean and tidy, with special collared buttoned shirts, and his hair \"perfectly groomed\". Devon was again regularly absent or late - the tardiness ranging from 15 minutes to as much as two hours late. If Devon managed to arrive on time in the morning, both he and his father entered the classroom together where Hussack Sr. took off his backpack, gave the \"finishing touches\" to his hairdo, set out his books and satisfied himself Devon was settled before leaving the classroom. In Lawn's view Devon was eager and ready to join in with his classmates but his father seemed to \"hold him back\". If Devon arrived late, the same procedure followed, distracting the other students and disrupting any ongoing lesson. Hussack Sr. regularly disrupted to class mid-lesson so as to deliver Devon's snack. Eventually Lawn instructed Hussack to desist and to drop off any such items at the office rather than disrupt the class\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "20  Lawn sought the advice of the local district school counsellor, Janet Carroll (\"Carroll\"). Carroll recounted her consultations with Paddy Lawn and other teachers, attempting to provide recommendations and strategies to deal with Hussack Sr. and his seeming inability to allow Devon any independence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "21  At the early parent-teacher meeting in the fall, Lawn recalled meeting with both Hussacks, warning them that unless Devon was given some space and opportunity to take personal responsibility, they would be left with a \"dish rag who would not be able to take care of himself\". She took some comfort in seeing that the mother agreed and thus expected some changes, but none followed. Hussack Sr.'s hovering behaviour continued at the same extreme level throughout the balance of the Grade 1 year\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "22  That spring, during a recess period, a classmate pushed Devon to the ground in the course of their schoolyard play. Hussack Sr., who had been standing outside the fence, immediately came over the fence and accosted the boy, terrifying him. The boys' parents complained and a meeting was called in the Principal's office where Hussack Sr. offered an apology to the child and his parents for his behaviour. Thereafter, Mr. Langford, the principal, kept a close monitor on Hussack Sr. whenever he was on the school grounds\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "23  One night a teacher who was working late at the school saw Hussack Sr. in the hallway, apparently coming from the direction of Lawn's Grade 1 classroom. He explained his presence, saying he had come to retrieve Devon's reading book. The next day the teacher informed Lawn, who inspected her desk and noted that some items had been moved about. (I accept Lawn's testimony that she never made any arrangement, as Hussack Sr. claimed, to come by the school late to pick up a homework assignment for Devon)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  The Grade 1 year ended on a sour note when the children all joined to enjoy a June swimming party at the local outdoor pool. Devon attended the party with his classmates. During the event a parent approached Lawn to complain that a man was hiding behind a bush near the chain link fence surrounding the pool, apparently taking photos of the children. She asked that Lawn call the police. Lawn approached the area and saw that it was Hussack Sr. taking photos. She told him he had to stop, since his behaviour was inappropriate and alarming parents at the pool. Far from apologetic, he angrily retorted that he would complain to the school principal which he did immediately. The principal supported Lawn's position and again, Hussack Sr. offered an apology for his actions. (I expect it was this incident as well as Hussack Sr.'s general lurking about the school which eventually gave rise to one of the emerging teasing themes - that is that Hussack Sr. was a pedophile)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "25  Mr. Langford, the school principal during Devon's kindergarten and Grade 1 years, saw Hussack Sr. as being \"over involved\" and \"over parenting\" Devon. He had a number of discussions with Hussack Sr. to discuss the matter. While Hussack Sr. always listened and sometimes acknowledged his actions were inappropriate, nothing ever changed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  Notably, in late 1991, during the early stages of the Grade 1 year, the Hussacks' own domestic conflicts were still brewing. In late 1991, on Hussack Sr.'s application, the Provincial Court granted a Consent Order for joint custody and guardianship of Devon to the Hussacks, with the child's principal residence to remain with his father, and the mother Faye to have reasonable and generous access. Since he insisted there were no marital difficulties, Hussack Sr. was unable to explain the Order, how it came to be in the hands of the School District or even when the court proceedings had been commenced. He speculated the proceedings had perhaps been commenced in 1989-1990, during the earlier periods of separation. Of course, this would not explain an application brought in December 1991\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  While he could not remember the dates, he admitted that on two occasions the police had been called to the Hussack family home, once in relation to his own alleged assault on his wife, and a second time in relation to her assault on him. While a criminal charge was apparently laid in connection with Hussack Sr.'s alleged assault, the charges were dropped at Mrs. Hussack's insistence. In the case of Mrs. Hussack's alleged assault on him, he says he never pressed any criminal charges\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  Much of Devon's elementary school years continued in the same vein as in the kindergarten and Grade 1 years. In Grade 6, Ms. Barbara Young (\"Young\"), a very experienced Ontario teacher, moved to Chilliwack and began work at the school, sharing a 65/35 job split of Grade 6 teaching duties, with the balance of her time as the Vice Principal at the school. As a result she was familiar with Devon's class work as well as his overall fit at the school\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  Young recalled Devon tended to be a loner, who enjoyed his time with one or two friends but did not interact generally with other students. She recalled that other students sometimes teased him about him being overweight and (like his father) sporting a distinctive mullet worn in a pony tail hairdo. Rather than resolve these issues by himself or with the help or support of a teacher, on several occasions Devon reported these matters to his father who then attended to report the matter to Young the next day. In Young's view, Hussack Sr. generally blew these matters out of proportion. More importantly, from Young's point of view, Devon was robbed of the opportunity to resolve his own battles\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  Devon's attendance continued to be very erratic. If Devon failed to report for morning attendance, and if Young was on administrative duty, she would often follow up by telephoning the Hussack home, triggering Devon to be delivered within a half hour. While Devon never explained his absences, Hussack Sr. always advised Young that Devon had been ill. The tardiness and absences were frustrating, since Hussack Sr. expected teaching staff to take the time to gather together all of the lesson material or assignments which had been missed, so as to identify what had to be done to catch up to the class. So as not to disrupt the class, meetings were arranged for day's end to review all of this material\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  So far as Young was concerned, Devon was missing out on the transference of information and knowledge passed on within the classroom. In her view, since his learning and attendance were erratic and inconsistent, he was missing the opportunity to consolidate his learning before moving to the next level\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "32  Hussack Sr. also had an inflated idea of Devon's talents. Since Devon had been exposed to some of the Grade 6 math curriculum in the course of Grade 5, Hussack Sr. formed the view at the outset of Devon's Grade 6 year that he had effectively completed his Grade 6 math work and ought to be assigned to a Grade 7 math class. Young refused to do so, insisting that Devon first complete a number of standardized math assessment tests so as to demonstrate he had mastered the Grade 6 curriculum. Those tests revealed that there were some significant gaps in Devon's Grade 6 math skills so various modules were provided for his completion. The assignments were not completed until mid-April of that year, the last term of the Grade 6 school year, at which point Devon was authorized to begin Grade 7 course work by way of distance education\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "33  Young recalled Devon being substantially behind on an art project which was to be completed over several lessons. After missing several days from school, Devon sheepishly handed in the art assignment which Young was convinced was not Devon's own work. To this point, Young had noted that from time to time Hussack Sr. would attend late with a package of assignment work for Devon to hand in, or he would meet with Devon in the school library over the noon recess to work on assignments together. Young and her fellow Grade 6 co-teacher decided that henceforth they would only evaluate work which Devon had actually completed in the classroom\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  Around this time Hussack Sr. was informed that in accordance with school policy, he could not be present and working as a volunteer with any student on the school property (including working in the library with his son) unless he passed a criminal records check. Ultimately Hussack Sr. failed the criminal records check. While the evidence was unclear, it appears that various complaints and charges arising from the Hussacks' domestic disputes (none of which were apparently pursued) resulted in this administrative \"failed\" criminal records check which was eventually resolved. In the interim, despite being told to remain off the school property, Hussack Sr. continued to slip into the school, using a back door entrance. Young caught him in the act and warned him that unless he left, she would call the police\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  Like Devon's previous teachers, Young expressed concern for Devon's emotional development. While she remembered Devon as a thoughtful, bright student with a good sense of humour and an apparent desire to please his teachers, he was nevertheless a concern. While Devon and his father's very close relationship might not ordinarily be a concern, Young worried that in this case Devon seemed to be \"dependent on his father's thoughts and opinions for everything he decided\". As she put it, instead of Devon making decisions for himself, \"everything was cleared through his father\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  Carroll, the District counsellor, vividly recalled that throughout the elementary school years, Devon and his father stood out in terms of Devon's chronic absences or late attendances and Hussack Sr.'s continuing over-involvement with his son. While Carroll did not work directly with Devon after Grade 1, she continued to consult with Devon's teachers and participate in school based meetings, attempting to develop strategies for dealing with Devon and his father. (Carroll had no recollection of she or other teachers ever meeting Mrs. Hussack who she described as an \"invisible parent\".\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  Despite all the concerns, in his elementary and middle school years Devon was not identified as a problem student in the sense that he required any specific individual counselling. As Carroll noted, Devon presented as a withdrawn boy, neither unhappy nor very engaged. So far as she was aware, he had no conflicts with other students or teachers and displayed no major problems in the classroom. Nevertheless, the same issues arose again and again-Devon's failure to attend school regularly, his lack of independence from his father, and his father's own troubling behaviours. As Carroll noted, none of these issues-whether attendance, tardiness or independence-were matters over which Devon had any control. Rather the problems at hand were largely in Devon's parents' (and specifically his father's) control\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  At trial, Devon acknowledged his chronic absences or tardiness at school. With some sense of amusement, he explained that his father is and was \"always a few minutes behind everyone else\". He explained that since his father drove him to school he was \"sort of at his mercy\". He was unable to offer any explanation for his father's tardiness. Regarding his actual absences from school, he explained that he found school boring since the schoolwork was \"pretty easy\". He believed that his parents eventually accepted his reasoning that so long as he maintained his grades there was no point in him going to school where he would \"be bored silly by the easy work and lose interest\". He said that while there was no \"pat on the back from (his) parents\" for skipping classes, they understood the situation and accepted it\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  Indeed Hussack Sr. explained that he was prepared to allow Devon to miss school, given his and Devon's mutual respect for each other. Hussack Sr. testified that beginning as early as kindergarten, if Devon said he did not feel like going to school because he was either bored or not feeling well, he simply accepted Devon's position and would not insist on him attending. He confirmed however that most of Devon's late attendances were attributable to his own failure to organize a timely drive to school\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "40  Following the Grade 6 year, Devon transferred to the local middle school-Vedder Middle School-for Grades 7, 8 and 9. While Mr. Robert Young, the school principal, described Devon as a \"regular 12-year-old student\", it was Hussack Sr. who stood out in his memory, since he was \"around the school all the time\". He was at the school daily and often shared lunch with Devon in his van in the school parking lot. As Young put it, \"it seemed that Devon could have no free time\". He described the dynamic between father and son to amount to \"smothering\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "41  As the school year wore on and Devon's absences and late attendances mounted, he included Devon in a list of students for the attention of the District secondary counsellor since Devon might require those services in future, in terms of attending an alternative school or completing his studies by way of distance education\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "42  The Grade 6 year also ended on a sour note, culminating in an incident of alleged bullying on the part of another boy in Devon's class. According to Hussack Sr., the boy initially befriended Devon but then turned on him, bullying him, harassing him and \"tormenting\" him at school. In a letter to the school trustees dated May 20, 1997 (Exhibit 2, Tab 45,) Hussack Sr. theorized that the boy had an infatuation with Devon and was therefore unable to accept Devon's earlier rejection of him. He insisted the matter was now \"out of control\" and that Devon was being subjected to unnecessary \"mental abuse\" and stress to the point he dreaded going to school and sometimes called his father to pick him up, complaining that he felt ill\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "43  On cross examination, Devon recalled a pony-tail pulling incident and what he perceived as his teacher's unfair disciplinary treatment of him. However, for the most part he downplayed the matter, claiming he was unable to recall most of the matters complained of in the father's letter and that while the boy had perhaps harassed him, he had never felt tormented or abused by him to the point of illness\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "44  While Devon initially attended his Grade 7 classes regularly, he gradually began to miss more and more classes and arrive late. Both Hussacks were invited to a school-based team meeting to discuss the situation. Mr. Skonberg (\"Skonberg\"), the vice-principal, recalled discussing Devon's alleged \"chronic illness\" and any means of encouraging Devon to attend school. Mrs. Hussack sat silently while Hussack Sr. spoke for them both. The meeting did not appear to resolve any of the issues\n",

      "\n",
      "46  Devon returned to school in the fall of 1998, enrolling in Grade 8. Based on a medical report detailing Devon's post-concussion syndrome, he was excused from Physical Education. Within a short time, his absences mounted and by November 1998, the school administration suggested Devon enrol in a Hospital Homebound School program which would allow him to complete Grade 8 at home, with a teacher liaising with the Grade 8 teachers and ferrying his schoolwork and assignments between the school and home. The Hussacks agreed to this arrangement, but eventually the venture failed by March 1999. As Skonberg explained, the Hussacks were rarely home when the Homebound program teacher visited the home at the appointed times. Nor did they return her telephone calls attempting to set up alternative times. On at least one occasion, she was aware that someone was actually present in the home, but was simply not answering the door. Eventually by April 1999 it was agreed that Devon should complete his Grade 8 work by way of correspondence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "47  Devon enrolled in Grade 9 at Vedder Middle School in September 1999. Hussack Sr. insisted Devon complete Grade 10 math by way of correspondence. Once again the absences mounted, as many as 56 in the first 65 school days. The school administration telephoned the Hussack home repeatedly, attempting to address Devon's absenteeism, his failing marks and even the failure to pick up the Math 10 materials. The school's phone telephone calls were blocked by a phone block at the Hussack home. The school reached the family via a grandparent, and the phone block was removed but eventually it was put in place again. Finally, by December 1999, the school principal wrote to the Hussacks advising that Devon would be withdrawn from the school and that he should pursue his studies by way of distance education\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  Devon completed his Social Studies 10 course in early 2001 and attempted to enrol in the local high school, Sardis Secondary, in the fall of 2001. It appears he was unable to enrol, and again he continued his studies by correspondence, although he withdrew from the balance of the Grade 10 curriculum courses, including Math 10, in late 2001-early 2002. He insisted his withdrawals were related to the requirement that he complete Grade 10 provincial examinations. I accept he is mistaken in this regard and that there were no provincial examinations in place for that grade level at that time. In any case, as Devon put it, he had reached a \"stalemate\" with the result that he effectively stopped his education at that time\n",

      "49  At the present time Devon lives at home with his father. (His mother died of bowel and liver cancer in late 2006). He spends much of his time alone, although a couple of his friends drop by the home from time to time. He said that while he initially tried to keep up \"a normal image\" and join them at the mall, he eventually gave up, since he found the outings too painful, given the bright lights and noise he was exposed to there. He obtained a learners drivers license in 2001, but was unable to obtain a full drivers license, since he repeatedly cancelled the scheduled tests because he was not feeling well. He said he later realised that the movement of other cars and pedestrians as well as the bright lights of other cars, triggered headaches. He said he realized that if he drove in those circumstances, he was putting other people in danger. Thus, he has never pursued a full license\n",

He eventually asks his father to prepare breakfast and later he showers with his father's help. He says that he spends his day switching between television, videos and the internet, trying to keep his mind off his predicament and to \"kill the boredom\". He telephones friends as well as his girlfriend. Approximately a year ago he met his girlfriend online. He says that he would like to marry her, although he is concerned that he will simply be a burden for her\n",

He tries to put dishes in the dishwasher but struggles with the noise of the clattering of the dishware and cutlery. He vacuums with earplugs in place. He is heavily dependent on his father who attends to all his needs, and he fears for his own future, given his father's declining health. As he puts it, \"my life is a living hell\".\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "52  Prior to the accident in April 1998, while Devon had no field hockey experience, he did have a good deal of experience in hockey type sports. He had played floor hockey as part of Physical Education classes in elementary school. During Grade 6, he had played a few intramural floor hockey games. For approximately 3-4 years he had played drop-in roller hockey at the local Chilliwack community center. He had also participated in the local Chilliwack minor ice hockey league for three years, including participating in one or two summer hockey camps. Hockey was his favourite sport, one that he enjoyed playing as well as watching on television. He was a right-handed player and at least while playing roller hockey and ice hockey, he wore the requisite helmet, with a face shield, and other gear\n",

      "\n",
      "53  By April 1998, in his Grade 7 school year, both the school administration and Mr. MacPhee (\"MacPhee\"), Devon's home room and Physical Education teacher, were concerned with the number of days Devon was either late or absent from school. The school principal had sent a letter home to the Hussacks on April 8, 1998 (Exhibit 2, Tab 56) noting that Devon had missed 51.5 days of the 136 school days to date, translating to a 38% absenteeism rate. In addition he had been late 30 times during the school year. Specifically, Devon's failure to attend many of his Grade 7 Physical Education classes had resulted in a failure of that subject in terms 2 and 3. Since Physical Education was a mandatory course for all Grade 7 students, a pass was essential for his promotion to the next grade level\n",

      "['38%']\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "54  Subsequent to the delivery of the April letter, a meeting was arranged at the school, attended by Devon, Hussack Sr., MacPhee and the school principal, Young. Based on previous discussions with both Devon and his father, MacPhee was aware of Devon's ice hockey background and his love of the sport. During the meeting he told Devon that the PE class was presently completing a three-week long field hockey unit (none of which Devon had attended) and that he was confident Devon would enjoy the game. He told him this would be a good opportunity to participate in PE and potentially earn a passing grade for the year. In MacPhee's view, field hockey would possibly be the \"carrot\" to lure Devon back to PE class\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "55  On April 17, 1998, MacPhee approached Devon prior to the upcoming PE period that day and once again encouraged him to join the field hockey class on the field. Devon arrived in the gym at the requisite time, properly dressed in a gym strip. The PE class is a co-ed class. Attendance was taken and the class went to the equipment room to pick up the necessary equipment (plastic cones, field hockey sticks and balls) and then proceed outside to the field area\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "56  At the outset, the class did a warm up run around the field while MacPhee placed the plastic cones to denote the goals on the ends of the two field hockey fields, lying side by side, running north-south along the Eastern half of the football field. The class assembled and did some stretching and a field hockey warm up exercise\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "57  At this point, MacPhee reviewed the events of the last class with the students and then divided the class into four teams, including Devon in one of the teams, attempting as best he could to create teams relatively equal in terms of size and skill level. As he had done before each of the field hockey class units, he reminded the students of the four basic rules: not using the back of the stick; not using their feet; not lifting the sticks above their knees; and finally not checking from behind. He then sent the students off to commence play. He assumed a position along the sidelines between the two fields in order to walk up and down between the two games, supervising the play\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "58  Approximately half way through the class, during the second game, one of the female students on Devon's team made a breakaway towards the goal. As she approached the goal she swung her stick backwards, so as to take a shot on goal. Unaware that Devon had run up behind her in an attempt to check her from behind, she lifted her field hockey stick in a backward motion up to just below her shoulder. On the backward swing, her field hockey stick struck Devon in the face, just above the bridge of his nose\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "59  Devon fell to the ground, moaning and groaning and crying, as he held his face. MacPhee immediately attended on him and escorted him back to the school office where arrangements were made for Hussack Sr. to attend and escort him to the hospital Emergency.\n",
      "IV. Was there a breach of the standard of care\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "60  The standard of care to be exercised by school authorities is that of a careful or prudent teacher. Thornton v. Board of School Trustees of School District No. 57 (Prince George), ,  (B.C.C.A.), is the seminal case which established the four-part test to be met in determining whether a teacher has met his or her duty of care. Four major criteria are considered as part of the test, namely (a) whether the activity was suitable to the age and mental and physical condition of the student; (b) whether the student was progressively trained and coached to do the activity properly and to avoid the danger; (c) whether the equipment was adequate and suitably arranged; and (d) whether the performance, having regard to its inherently dangerous nature, was properly supervised\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "61  As the Court noted in Myers v. Peel (County) Board of Education,  at 32, , the standard of care is case specific and cannot be:\n",
      "... applied in the same manner and to the same extent in every case. Its application will vary from case to case and will depend upon the number of students being supervised at any given time, the nature of the exercise or activity in progress, the age and the degree of skill and training which the student may have received in connection with such activity, the nature and condition of the equipment in use at the time, the competency and capacity of the students involved, and a host of other matters which may be widely varied but which, in a given case, may affect the application of the prudent parent-standard to the conduct of the school authority in the circumstances\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "62  While the plaintiff pursued a broad range of allegations of negligence at trial (including MacPhee's grouping of student teams, his teacher position while supervising, and the lack of any student umpiring, etc.), in closing submissions, the plaintiff's single allegation of negligence was MacPhee's failure to ensure Devon had been progressively taught the skills of the field hockey game before allowing him to participate in the round robin play in the final day of the unit. In effect the plaintiff says that since MacPhee was well aware Devon had missed all of the field hockey class units prior to the accident, he ought not to have allowed him, let alone encouraged him, to join the class for the round robin play on the final day of the unit\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  The field hockey unit was designed to take up three weeks of the school term, thus allowing for some 6-7 classes. Each class was 68 minutes long, comprising approximately 40 minutes of participation in the game. In this case, prior to the date of the accident, MacPhee had already spent the first 4-5 classes of the unit teaching the students the basic field hockey skills as well as the rules of the sport, before moving onto actual round robin games. The day of the accident, April 17th, was the final day of the field hockey unit, when the students would have their second real chance to play a full round robin game\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  Despite his knowledge that Devon had not participated in any of the previous field hockey classes and had no other exposure to the sport, MacPhee testified that he had no concerns about Devon participating in the round robin games that day. He emphasized that since all of the students were essentially beginners, the level of field hockey was very basic. Thus, in his view, there was no need for any special skills to be progressively taught in order that Devon be able to safely participate in the game\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "65  Like the defence field hockey expert, Ms. Mairi Anne Longmore (\"Longmore\"), MacPhee believed that Devon's ice hockey skills would carry over into playing field hockey. In his view, in the context of a participation-based class, the skills which had been acquired by the other students by that point were \"not beyond anything where (Devon) would be at\", particularly given his ice hockey background. Longmore also agreed that generally students who have had previous hockey experience of any sort are more adept at picking up the basic field hockey skills - particularly dribbling skills as well as the push-pass of the ball\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "66  Relying on the evidence of Longmore and MacPhee, the defence submits that on the date of the accident, as a result of his extensive ice hockey and other hockey related experience, Devon was indeed probably more skilled than many of the other students. Thus there would be no concern in parachuting him into the field hockey games on the final PE period of that unit\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "67  By contrast, the plaintiff's field hockey expert, Ms. Gail Wilson (\"Wilson\"), testified that while the progressive teaching of basic field hockey skills is always important, it is particularly so in the case of ice hockey players, since it is those players who must \"unlearn\" certain skills\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  Wilson conceded there is a good deal of cross-over between the two sports. Both are invasive, goal-territory games, with the underlying objective of blocking territory and crossing lines. A player's tactics and decision making will be similar in each sport\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "69  That said, she underscored that many of the ice hockey - floor hockey skills are not directly transferable. As she put it, while floor hockey, ice hockey and ball hockey are all a version of ice hockey-field hockey is the anomaly in the set. Field hockey stands apart from those other sports in several respects, but most particularly with regard to the checking-tackling skills\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "70  Checking from behind is quite common in ice hockey and is more easily and safely accomplished given the longer ice hockey stick and all of the safety equipment worn, including helmet, faceguard, and pads. However in the case of field hockey, while a player will approach an opposing player from behind in order to then tackle or check him or her from the side, the approach must be handled carefully since the player is both handling a shorter stick (and is therefore closer to the opponent) and is bending over the stick (and is therefore lower to the ground). As a result, depending on his or her approach from behind, the field hockey player attempting a \"tackle\" will be extremely vulnerable to injury, and in particular being struck in the face with the field hockey stick\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  Wilson testified that the students she has the hardest time teaching are the ice hockey players since, in order to play field hockey effectively, they must \"unlearn\" their ice hockey skills. While a badminton player must unlearn his wrist shots for tennis, and a recreational swimmer must unlearn his frog kick so as to incorporate a whip kick to the more modern breaststroke, so too an experienced ice hockey player must unlearn certain skills and adopt new ones in order to play safely\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "72  In Wilson's opinion, simply telling such a player that he must not tackle from behind will not suffice. Rather time and practice must be spent \"unlearning\" the ice hockey checking manoeuvres. In her opinion, in this case Devon did not have time to unlearn his checking skills. In effect his ice hockey skills hurt him. Further, to the extent he internalized the teacher's instruction that the field hockey stick ought not to be raised in a back swing, he was, in her view, that much more vulnerable to injury, believing himself to be safely behind his opponent, while attempting an ice hockey type check\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "73  Indeed this is what occurred in this case. As Devon watched his classmate make what he believed was a breakaway for the goal, his ice hockey/floor hockey skills kicked in and he ran up behind her intending to \"poke check\" her, that is reach out his stick with both hands in an effort to knock the ball away from her, just as he would in an ice hockey or floor hockey game. I accept his evidence that while recognizing his potentially vulnerable position behind the player, he never anticipated any slapshot manoeuvre on his opponent's part. As he put it, while he might be vulnerable if his ice hockey opponent was at the blue line and perhaps readying herself to attempt a slapshot on goal, he would not anticipate such a play during an opponent's breakaway, since such a play raises the risk of the opponent (at least in ice hockey or floor hockey) losing control of the puck or ball\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "74  Wilson emphasized that while MacPhee had reviewed all of the basic rules at the outset of play, including the relevant one here - no checking from behind - that simple rule would be far from understood or internalized by the student who had never played field hockey before and who, given his ice hockey experience, would have a lowered sensitivity to the risk\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "75  As Wilson noted, since Devon had never learned any of the basic skills or even how to play the game, he lacked both the skills as well as the context in which to apply those skills. As Devon himself testified, he treated the game like a floor hockey game-unfortunately with dire consequences\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "76  The defence has submitted that I ought to ignore Wilson's evidence, or at least accord that evidence little weight, since Wilson has spent the majority of her career teaching human kinetics at the university level, as well as coaching the women's national field hockey team. Her last stint as a teacher was in a secondary school setting in the Ontario Public School system from 1968 to 1977\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "77  By contrast, Longmore has been a teacher in the British Columbia public school system for over 26 years and has taught co-ed field hockey at the Grade 8 level for 18 of those years, including the McMath Secondary School field hockey team in Richmond for 8 years\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "78  Longmore, like other Vedder Secondary teachers who testified at trial, rejected many aspects of Wilson's pedagogic model of instruction. For example she rejected Wilson's notion of selecting teams according to each student's ability; creating small teams of 3 per team resulting in as many as 10 teams playing during a class; dividing the playing field into five play areas with each team possibly playing to a different set of rules (depending on their skill level); as well as appointing and training student umpires to supervise games\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "79  Given the public school system's philosophy, which stresses positive participation rather than the acquisition of significant skills (with a view to exposing students to a wide variety of sports and encouraging the development of lifelong physically active people), MacPhee stressed that many of Wilson's criticisms simply had no place in the instruction of adolescents\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  While I agree that this is so, the issue remains whether the safety of the individual student still remains a paramount concern, even in the context of a \"positive participation\" physical education model. There is no dispute that the answer must be affirmative. To adopt Wilson's motto, safety trumps all\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "81  That being the case, the simple question is whether, in all of the circumstances, it was reasonable for MacPhee, as a PE secondary school teacher, to have allowed Devon to participate in the field hockey games that day, knowing he had no exposure to the sport, although some considerable hockey experience\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "82  It is notable that in addressing the transferability of ice hockey skills to the game of field hockey, Longmore specifically noted the transferability of dribbling skills as well as the push-pass. She did not, however, identify checking as one of the transferable skills. In her direct examination she testified that the method of checking was similar in both ice hockey and field hockey - that is the checker approaches his opponent from the side\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  In cross examination she conceded that in ice hockey, a checker might indeed approach from behind since the ice hockey stick (contrary to the field hockey stick) is longer, although even in the context of ice hockey, this was a dangerous play. She sought to discount this difference. She pointed out that Devon, like other students, was told at the outset of that one class not to check from behind. Regarding the issue of the lack of any opportunity for progressive teaching of this rule she testified that in any event, so far as she was aware, a student could not be progressively taught to avoid checking from behind. In her view, this was not a skill to be taught, but rather simply a rule to be followed. (In this respect it is notable that Longmore admitted that she did not teach the basic \"no checking from behind\" rule in her own field hockey physical education classes. She conceded that since her involvement in this case, she recognized it was a good safety rule and one she intended to incorporate in her own future classes)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  I have some difficulty with Longmore distinguishing between a skill which can be progressively taught and a \"rule\" which must simply be stated by the teacher and presumably followed by the students. The rule is of course learned in the course of supervised play over a series of games. As Wilson testified, all students must ultimately learn how to dispossess the opponent of the ball, and thus must learn how to check or tackle efficiently and safely. Learning how to avoid checking from behind would be a key component in the effort to dispossess an opponent\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  With respect, while I accept Longmore is a very experienced teacher, I am left with the impression that, prior to this trial, she had not seriously considered the risks inherent in checking from behind, the ways and means of teaching this \"rule\", and whether a rank beginner field hockey player, with an ice hockey background, might be a more vulnerable player given his very different checking background. In conclusion, I have placed little weight on Longmore's evidence concerning the checking issue\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  In the same vein, while I accept that MacPhee is a most experienced, talented physical education teacher, I question the wisdom of a single aspect of his actions that day-that is allowing Devon to participate in the game. MacPhee's decision, while obviously well intended and designed to provide Devon with a pathway to a passing grade, rested on the erroneous assumption that Devon, unlike other students, could safely participate in the game notwithstanding his absence from all of the previous classes in which the skills building blocks were put in place. In the end result, I find that his allowing Devon to participate in the game in these circumstances constituted a breach of his duty of care to Devon.\n",
      "V. Was Devon contributorily negligent by checking from behind\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "87  The defence submits that in the circumstances of this case, Devon ought to be held 50% contributorily negligent, by virtue of his actions in attempting to poke-check his opponent from behind. Considering his age and his previous hockey experience, the defence submits he knew or ought to have known he was placing himself in a dangerous position when he approached his opponent from behind\n",
      "PERCENT MENTIONED\n",
      "['50%']\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "88  By virtue of his hockey experience, the defence says he was well aware that when approaching from behind a player, there is an increased risk of being hit in the face with a stick, whether playing ice hockey or floor hockey - and that such a risk was increased incrementally if one stood behind another player. At the outset of the game, MacPhee had reviewed the rules of the game, including not to raise one's stick above the knees and not to check from behind. In the course of the first game, when MacPhee was turned away, supervising the other game, Devon had witnessed \"the sticks getting higher, people taking fancier shots\", including slapshots\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "89  Accordingly, the defence says that as a 13-year-old student of above average intelligence, Devon ought to have realized the inherent risks of this sport and taken care not to attempt a check from behind-a play he ought to have identified as particularly risky\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "90  For the reasons already outlined earlier, I have some difficulty with the notion that Devon ought to be held contributorily negligent for the failings in his field hockey play, given his lack of any previous experience in the sport and his teacher's invitation to join in the play, notwithstanding his lack of any exposure to any progressive learning of the sport to that point. My sense of what occurred here was an unfortunate confusion of appropriate hockey checking techniques with inappropriate field hockey tackling techniques-a failure for which Devon should not be held responsible.\n",
      "VI. Credibility\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "91  I should note at the outset that I have no serious concerns regarding Devon's credibility. While his recounting of his history was inaccurate in some respects, I accept that many of his childhood memories have been coloured by his father's own skewed recollection of events. That said, Devon was quick to acknowledge that some of the school events were simply not as difficult nor as traumatic as Hussack Sr. contended. Overall, I am satisfied Devon was a credible witness who provided his evidence without exaggeration or embellishment. While a number of the physicians noted that some of his symptoms abated or disappeared outside the scrutiny of clinical examination (ie. the hand tremors), I accept that this is not an uncommon phenomenon in the case of psychogenic injuries. None of the experts in this action have suggested Devon's injuries were feigned or that he was a malingerer\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "92  However regarding Hussack Sr., my assessment must be more harsh. On a number of occasions, Hussack Sr. provided evidence that was either exaggerated or misleading. His insistence that the attendance on Dr. Lavalle was not connected with school refusal; his failure to advise either Drs. Chan or Dunne about the family history of migraines and tremors; his initial description of a 20 year rather than a 10 year military history; his failure to admit the breadth of he and his wife's marital discord; his apparent inability to recall the necessity for his criminal records pardon; and his repeatedly inaccurate recountings of his dealings with various teachers and school administrators all speak to this individual's lack of credibility. As the defence has suggested, Hussack Sr. appears ready to expand, exaggerate and misrepresent the truth for his own purposes.\n",
      "VII. Post-Incident Actions and Injuries\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "93  While the plaintiff's case was initially premised on the allegation he had suffered a mild traumatic brain injury, that medical theory was not vigorously pursued at trial (notwithstanding the calling of Dr. Brian Hunt and Dr. Raymond Ancill as witnesses) and indeed was completely abandoned in the course of plaintiff's counsel's closing submissions. Thus I intend to spend no time addressing that allegation except in the context of considering Hussack Sr.'s actions\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "94  It must nevertheless be noted that while Devon's initial injury did not constitute a brain injury, he did indeed suffer a significant blow to the head in the course of the field hockey accident, sufficient to cause lacerations and some extensive soft tissue bruising with swelling over the bridge of his nose, forehead and both eyes, as observed by the hospital Emergency staff on the date of the incident, April 17, 1998. Despite Dr. Ancill's finding of post-traumatic amnesia, Devon's own detailed recollection of events, coupled with findings to like effect by the various physicians who examined him post-accident, suggest there was no evidence of amnesia\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "95  On April 23, 1998 he visited his family doctor's office complaining of a headache. This accords with Devon's own recounting of his history to both Dr. Foti and Dr. Ong, advising that he developed headaches approximately one week after the incident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "96  On May 6, 1998 he attended the local hospital Emergency department complaining he had suffered a constant frontal headache for the last 2-3 days associated with nausea, no vomiting and poor sleep. He was diagnosed with a headache and a resolving hematoma over the bridge of his nose\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "97  On May 21, 1998, he once again returned to his family doctor complaining of constant frontal headaches (which varied in intensity), drowsiness and a sensitivity to light\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "98  By May 26, 1998, when he next attended the Emergency department, his symptoms had evolved to now include complaints of weakness, tiredness, altered concentration, sleep disruption, and mild photophobia. While Devon denied any stress which might account for his symptoms, the Emergency physician believed the headaches might be tension headaches, reflecting some stress at school\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "99  On attending the family doctor on May 29, 1998, Devon now complained that his frontal headaches had increased and that he was suffering difficulties with both memory and balance. He admitted that he was being teased a lot at school, especially regarding his father who some students labelled a \"pedophile\" since he always seemed to be lurking about the school and on occasion taking photos or films of the students. The attending physician's differential diagnosis included possible mild concussive symptoms and possible stress related to teasing and muscle traction headaches\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "100  In the interim, Hussack Sr. had been investigating various medical internet sites and had become convinced Devon was brain damaged. Impressed with his earlier encounters with Dr. Fitzpatrick in the hospital Emergency, Hussack Sr. asked Dr. Fitzpatrick whether he would take both him and Devon on as new patients. He agreed. On attending his office on June 3, 1998, Devon and Hussack Sr. now reported a much expanded list of Devon's symptoms: a shaking of the hands which had begun the night before; sore eyes; lost concentration; sensitivity to loud noises; improvement in dizziness; colour changes in and pain across the forehead; and fluctuating body temperatures (See Exhibit 1, Tab 3, p. 15)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "101  While Dr. Fitzpatrick did not believe there was any serious underlying pathology, over the ensuing months he acceded to Hussack Sr.'s continuing requests for Devon to be referred to various specialists beginning with Dr. MacFayden, a neurologist, in early June 1998. By this point Devon was complaining of some soreness in his head and an internal feeling that everything in his body was \"twitching\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "102  Despite Dr. MacFayden's reassurance, Hussack Sr. insisted on a further assessment, and again Dr. Fitzpatrick complied with the request, this time referring Devon to Dr. Caissie, a paediatrician. In the course of Dr. Caissie's examination in July 1998, Devon repeated the same long list of complaints, which now also included headaches associated with a blue discolouration in his forehead, hyperacusis (abnormal acuteness of hearing) and a tremor in his hands. The examination was normal save for a very mild tremulousness in the hands when his fingers were hyperextended\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "103  Further referrals followed to: Dr. Low Ying, a paediatrician; Dr. Commerford, Dr. Juliette Hukin, a paediatric neurologist, and Dr. Michael Hayman, a neurology fellow at B.C. Children's Hospital. By this point Devon's list of complaints had expanded to include aching in the joints. In Dr. Hukin's opinion Devon was exhibiting some post-concussive features superimposed on migraines in a setting of a positive family history of migraines. She recommended blood and urine tests and emphasized the need for a psychological consultation (Exhibit 1, Tab 3, pages 63-66)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "104  Hussack Sr. then insisted an MRI was necessary and again Dr. Fitzpatrick complied, referring Devon to Dr. Chan, a neurosurgeon, for the initial neurological consultation. He examined Devon in October 1998 and concluded he had suffered a mild cerebral concussion, with the development of a post-concessional syndrome. He reassured Devon and his father the degree of concussion was very mild and that an MRI would not be approved given the negative CT scan and in the absence of any neurological finding\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "105  Throughout the balance of that year and the years which followed, Devon began to complain of new and ever worsening symptoms: visual distortions in November 1998; pain in the center of his head, sore eyes, a numb forehead and abnormal smells in December 1998; constant tremors throughout his entire body, abnormal head snapping and twitches, and stuttering and mumbling beginning in January 1999; constant generalized muscle aches throughout his body beginning in November 1999 and worsening throughout 2000-2001; and finally episodes of severe chest pain commencing in 2000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "106  Dr. Fitzpatrick, who continues to this day to act as the Hussack family doctor, expressed his frustration dealing with the Hussacks, but most particularly Hussack Sr. during this period. Hussack Sr. often attended his office alone, pressing his wish that Dr. Fitzpatrick pursue yet another line of medical investigation. When Devon attended in the office, Hussack Sr. was also usually present during any examination, often prompting Devon in his recall of symptoms\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "107  While Dr. Fitzpatrick did his best to paint a positive picture of Hussack Sr., describing him as an \"extremely caring\" parent who was excessively, although not obsessively interested in addressing his son's complaints, he admitted in cross examination that he did consider the father's relentless investigation efforts to be \"obsessive\" in nature. He admitted Hussack Sr. was a difficult patient, one who historically disrupted and upset his office staff with continual phone calls\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "108  Although unrelenting in his demands of Dr. Fitzpatrick, Hussack Sr. did little to reciprocate in following Dr. Fitzpatrick's own instructions. Dr. Fitzpatrick's repeated suggestions that Devon pursue psychological treatment were dismissed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "109  Dr. Fitzpatrick agreed, as Dr. Hukin had recommended as early as the fall of 1998, that some psychological treatment for Devon was required. Hussack Sr. repeatedly rejected these recommendations, dismissing any suggestion Devon's symptoms might have a psychogenic component. He also rejected Dr. Fitzpatrick's recommendations that anti-depressant medication be attempted\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "110  However by December 1998, even Hussack Sr. was willing for Devon to begin anti-depressant medication. Devon had recently exhibited histrionic behaviour in the Emergency department of the local hospital and the Emergency physician had recommended anti-depressant medication. While Devon apparently commenced a course of anti-depressant medication, the medication was discontinued, although it is not clear why\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "111  At the recommendation of a Dr. Hahn, the Hussacks were referred to Mr. John Simpson, to seek assistance. Mr. Simpson, once the Director of Rehabilitation for ICBC, was retired and working as a private consultant in the Fraser Valley area. He visited with the Hussacks on several occasions and recommended they seek a referral to Dr. Ancill, a local psychiatrist who apparently specialized in the treatment of traumatic head injury patients. At Hussack Sr.'s request, Dr. Fitzpatrick obliged and made the necessary referral to Dr. Ancill\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "112  Devon and his father attended Dr. Ancill's office on May 11, 2000. Unfortunately, Devon's first and main opportunity to be exposed to a proper psychiatric assessment failed. No fulsome history of the family dynamics was obtained or recorded by Dr. Ancill. Dr. Ancill admitted that he approached the matter from a \"biological\" perspective. He diagnosed Devon as having suffered a traumatic brain injury and prescribed Topomax to address his irritability. He noted Hussack Sr.'s refusal to consider any \"mind altering\" drug such as Prozac. He recommended Devon return for assessment in one month's time. Hussack Sr. immediately investigated the drug prescribed. Convinced that Dr. Ancill had prescribed \"mind altering drugs\" for his son, Hussack Sr. refused to fill the prescription and discontinued any further treatment for Devon under Dr. Ancill's care\n",
      "======\n",

Despite Dr. Fitzpatrick's refusal to prescribe the medication to Devon and his specific instructions that Hussack Sr. not provide Devon with his own supply, Hussack Sr. did so. He provided Devon with three Tylenol 3 tablets per week, progressing to four pills per day by February 2005. Finally by July 2005, aware of this drug abuse issue, Dr. Fitzpatrick attempted to convince Hussack Sr. to try Devon on a different non-caffeinated drug although he appeared unclear as to whether this had occurred or not.

      "\n",
      "117  Both parties agree that the blow to the head in the course of the field hockey accident at least caused a mild concussion (perhaps with no loss of consciousness), and some initial post-concussive symptomology. (Relying on the evidence of Dr. Keyes, the defence says the physical injuries attributable to the incident are relatively mild and should have resolved within 4-6 months of the accident). Both parties also agree that as time progressed, Devon's symptoms worsened and eventually developed into a full blown somatoform disorder\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "118  The parties disagree however as to the causation of the somatoform disorder. The plaintiff says the somatoform disorder was caused by the injuries suffered in the accident. The defence says that the developmental stages of a somatoform disorder pre-existed the accident. Further the defence says that Hussack Sr.'s own acts and omissions as well as Devon's own failure to follow the advice of his medical practitioners, contributed to the development of the disorder.\n",
      "IX. Cause in fact - The \"but for\" test\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "119  The basic test for determining causation remains the \"but for\" test. As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke, , , the test applies to multi-cause injuries. The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that \"but for\" the negligent act or omission of each defendant, the injury would not have occurred. However, compensation for negligent conduct will only be made where a substantial connection between the injury and the defendant's conduct is present\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "120  The plaintiff concedes that as a result of the initial injury and the post-concussion syndrome which followed, Devon's father, through his over-protectiveness and obsessive focus on his son's condition, may indeed have caused or contributed to the eventual development of Devon's somatoform disorder. Nevertheless, the plaintiff says that \"but for\" the blow to his head and the resulting symptoms, his father would not have reacted, thus leading to the eventual outcome here. Put another way, the plaintiff says the blow to the head caused by the defendant's negligent act, was the \"cause-in-fact\" of his psychological symptoms\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "121  While the field hockey incident may have caused Devon's physical injuries, the defence says it did not cause his eventual somatoform disorder. Rather, the defence says the relationship between Devon and his father was the critical factor in the evolution of the somatoform disorder\n",

      "\n",
      "122  On a review of all of the evidence I am satisfied the plaintiff has proven on a balance of probabilities that the blow to the head (resulting from the defendant's negligence) was indeed the trigger which set in motion the sequence of events leading to the development of Devon's somatoform disorder. I find that but for the head injury and the original resulting symptoms as well as the others which followed, the somatoform disorder would not have developed\n",

In her opinion, the initial injury formed the basis of the subsequent problems which developed. (Dr. Stewart's evidence, February 12, 2009, page 8)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "125  Dr. Krywaniuk also testified that the triggering event was the blow to Devon's head. As he put it, the blow to the head was the basis or the platform of the somatoform disorder which followed. In his report of December 2, 2008 he notes: \"it is my opinion that the accident was a significant contributing factor, possibly in the form of a trigger, to Mr. Hussack's current situation\". In cross examination he testified:\n",
      "It takes a traumatic event, and usually of a physical kind, and then you get the either somatoform or in some cases the conversion reaction. But it's sort of based on some sort of trauma, even though the person may have that kind of psychological substrata there ... So quite apart from what his father reacted to it, he had his own experience of that event. And the father's actions could have reinforced that connection that he made.

      "126  The defence relies on the opinion of Dr. O'Shaughnessy, who disagrees that the blow to the head caused the somatoform disorder. Rather in his opinion, the plaintiff's pre-incident history, including his school refusal and the family dynamic issues, was the primary cause of the eventual development of the somatoform disorder. He says that that even prior to the accident, as a victim of his family's pathology, Devon was already psychologically dependent on his father, had already developed school refusal or school phobia, and was in the early stages of developing somatoform complaints. As Dr. O'Shaughnessy notes in his report of June 12, 2008:\n",
      "... I have little doubt that had he been more assertively returned to school by his family both before and after this incident occurred he would not have gone on to develop the somatoform illness manifested today nor would he find himself in his unfortunate social situation ... In my opinion, it was not the injury but rather the psychological need for dependency, the psychological need to avoid school, and the lack of intervention and structured parenting that led to his current somatoform illness and psychological and social dependency. (added emphasis\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "127  In my view, while Dr. O'Shaughnessy's evidence supports the notion that the plaintiff's relationship with his father may have played a role in the development of the somatoform disorder, it does not rule out the conclusions that the initial field hockey incident was the initial triggering event and that the plaintiff's pre-accident history and family pathology were but some of, although not the exclusive factors leading to the development of the somatoform disorder\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "128  In his report of June 12, 2008 Dr. O'Shaughnessy agrees that \"(the) concussion may well have triggered the symptoms of Post-concussion Syndrome initially described,\" as Dr. Krywaniuk also testified\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "129  Dr. O'Shaughnessy describes the role of the hockey stick incident in the following terms:\n",
      "In my opinion, the hockey stick incident is not responsible in any significant way for the subsequent development of his Somatoform illness, chronic pain, bizarre symptoms, deconditioned state, or the evolution into this dependent emotional state.\n",
      "The subsequent events with the over solicitous and dependent producing behaviour by his father clearly triggered increasing symptoms and increasingly dependant attachments. In my view, the most important factors related to his development of a somatoform illness are the underlying school phobia and the dependant attachment between father and son that has served to focus attention on body symptoms that have clearly expanded overtime.\n",
      "...\n",
      "These are certainly consistent descriptions of excessive concern by Mr. Hussack that would certainly be consistent with the opinions I expressed earlier i.e. that Devon's primary difficulties are a combination of school phobia and family dynamics encouraging marked dependency (Exhibit 20, Tab 15). (added emphasis\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "130  I will note in passing that in this excerpt Dr. O'Shaughnessy implicitly accepts that the \"hockey stick incident\" (i.e. the blow to the head) played some role in the causation of the subsequent events here. Implicitly, he also accepts that the blow to the head caused the initial symptoms although he concludes it was the school phobia and dependant attachment between the father and son which caused the increasing symptoms\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "131  Perhaps most enlightening in understanding his causation theory was what plaintiff's counsel calls the \"causative metaphor\" which Dr. O'Shaughnessy developed at trial in his evidence in chief. As Dr. O'Shaughnessy testified:\n",
      "... if you get a bug bite and it raises an itchy swollen lesion, and you scratch it, it will make it worse. And if you keep scratching it, it will get worse and worse, until you can in fact end up with an open sore of quite large magnitude. ... That's kind of a, if you will, a physical metaphor for what happened here. The incident when he got smacked in the nose with a hockey stick was the bug bite, but the real thing that provoked the somatoform illness was the father's behaviour in driving it forward over and over. That's the but for, in my opinion, that was necessary in this case. (Evidence, February 26, morning direct, page 59\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "132  In my view the causative metaphor employed by Dr. O'Shaughnessy conflates the concepts of cause in fact and cause in law. In terms of the cause in fact, I am satisfied that \"but for\" the blow to the head, (ie. the \"bug bite\") and the resulting symptoms (the initial mild concussion and post-concussion syndrome symptoms), there would have been no reaction on the part of Hussack Sr., and thus no development of the somatoform disorder. While the family pathology, particularly Hussack Sr.'s overprotective and obsessive actions, played a large role here, this does not negate the causative role of the initial head injury. The law is clear that the defendant's actions need not be the only cause of the subsequent injury. It is enough that the defendant's negligence was one of the causal factors which resulted in his injury. Defendants whose acts were necessary parts of the causal sequence will be fully liable for the injuries (Athey v. Leonati, , ; Assiniboine South School Division v. Greater Winnipeg Gas Co., ,  (Man. C.A.); and Nader v. Urban Transit Authority (1985) 2 N.S.W.L.R. 501 (New South Wales C. A.)).\n",
      "X. Cause-in-law: Were the plaintiff's injuries reasonably foreseeable? Or was the accident the proximate cause of the loss\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "133  In terms of the second strand of the causation theory, the defence says the plaintiff has failed to prove the cause in law-namely that the injuries were foreseeable or not too remote. As the defence puts it at para. 563 of the Written Argument:\n",
      "While it was foreseeable that while playing field hockey a student could get hit with a stick and be injured, the serious mental injury that the plaintiff has developed as a result of his father, was not foreseeable and that an objective person of ordinary fortitude would not have sustained such a serious reaction to such a trifling event\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "134  This reference to a person of \"ordinary fortitude\" is found in the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision in Mustapha v. Culligan, , . There the plaintiff became ill when he saw a dead fly in an unopened bottle of drinking water supplied by the defendant. He developed a major depressive disorder, anxiety and a phobia about showering. He brought an action against the defendants for damages for emotional distress and nervous shock caused by the defendant's negligence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "135  The case supports the proposition that where an individual suffers a severe psychiatric injury, an unusual or extreme reaction to events caused by negligence will not be found to be reasonably foreseeable unless the plaintiff is able to establish that such a mental injury would occur in a person of ordinary fortitude. In this respect the Supreme Court of Canada noted at para. 15:\n",
      "As the Court of Appeal found ... the requirement that a mental injury would occur in a person of ordinary fortitude ... is inherent in the notion of foreseeability. This is true whether one considers foreseeability at the remoteness or at the duty of care stage. As stated in Tame v. New South Wales (2002) 211 C.R. 317, [2002] H.C.A. 35 (Australia H.C.), per Gleeson C.J., this 'is a way of expressing the idea that there are some people with such a degree of susceptibility to psychiatric injury that it is ordinarily unreasonable to require strangers to have in contemplation the possibility of harm to them, or to expect strangers to take care to avoid harm' (para. 16). To put it another way, unusual or extreme reactions to events caused by negligence are imaginable but not reasonably foreseeable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "136  Thus in a pure nervous shock case, where no physical injury has been suffered, the remoteness inquiry depends not only upon the degree of probability required to meet the reasonable foreseeability requirement, but also upon whether or not the plaintiff is considered objectively or subjectively. In a pure nervous shock case, Mustapha suggests the plaintiff will be considered objectively, except in those cases where it is proved the defendant had actual knowledge of the plaintiff's particular sensibilities. In such cases the ordinary fortitude requirement will not be strictly applied\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "137  While the boundaries of the reasonable foreseeability requirements are understandably constrained in cases of pure nervous shock, as was the case in Mustapha, the limits of foreseeability in the case at bar, which involves both an initial physical injury as well as a mental injury which followed, are not so constrained. To the contrary, the courts have always distinguished between pure psychiatric damage claims and those claims which are accompanied by a physical injury\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "138  The fact that the ultimate outcome here was unusual or surprising begs the issue of whether or not the initial head injury was the cause in law. The defence position articulated in para. 563 above ignores the rule in Hughes v. Lord Advocate, [1963] 1 All E.R. 705, adopted by Dickson J. (as he then was) in Assiniboine South School District v. Greater Winnipeg Gas Co. at 752:\n",
      "It is enough to fix liability if one could foresee in a general way the sort of thing that happened. The extent of the damage and its manner of incidence need not be foreseeable if physical damage of the kind which in fact ensues is foreseeable. ... [emphasis added]\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "139  There are a number of authorities in which a party suffers an injury by virtue of the defendant's negligence and goes on to develop a mental illness, whether hysteria or a somatoform disorder or conversion disorder or some other illness. In all of these cases, the courts will apply the usual principles which apply in relation to causation (Varga v. John Labbatt, ,  (H.C.); Yoshikawa v. Yu ,  (C.A.); Edwards v. Marsden, ; Samuel v. Levi, ). As Lambert J.A. noted in Yoshikawa at para. 13 \"(t)he general principles which apply in relation to causation in law will apply to psychological injury as they apply to physical injury\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "140  In this case, I am persuaded that but for the defendant's negligence the plaintiff's psychological symptoms would not have occurred or at least would not have occurred in the way that they did. Further, I am satisfied the plaintiff has proven that the defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's psychological symptoms.\n",
      "XI. Is the plaintiff a \"crumbling skull\" or a \"thin skull\" victim\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "141  Thirdly, addressing the issue of damages, the defence says that even accepting causation is proven, the defendant is not liable at law to put the plaintiff in a better position than his original position: Athey v. Leonati, at para. 35. In other words, he is not required to compensate the plaintiff for any debilitating effects of a pre-existing condition which the plaintiff would have experienced in any event: Athey, at para. 35. This is known as the \"crumbling skull\" rule\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "142  The crumbling skull rule can be distinguished from the well-known thin skull rule, which holds that a negligent defendant must take a plaintiff as he finds him or her. The thin skull rule makes the negligent defendant liable for the plaintiff's injuries even if the injuries are unexpectedly severe owing to a pre-existing condition: Athey, at para. 34. Thus, in a thin skull case, the defendant is liable even though the plaintiff's losses are more dramatic than they would be for the average person\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "143  The thin skull rule applies to psychological as well as physical injuries - this is the \"egg shell personality\" application of the principle: Yoshikawa, at para. 19. As the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated in Yoshikawa:\n",
      "A predisposition to suffer psychological injury in circumstances such as those brought about in a particular case by a defendant's wrongful act does not relieve the defendant of the liability to compensate the plaintiff for the injuries represented by those psychological symptoms (para. 19)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "144  The court went on to state that relief of the defendant's liability is only possible \"... if the psychological symptoms would have occurred in any event, even without the defendant's wrongful act\" (para. 19)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "145  As stated in Athey, the test for a crumbling skull claim is whether there is a \"measurable risk\" that the pre-existing condition would have detrimentally affected the plaintiff regardless (para. 35). The defence says that even before the field hockey incident, there was a real risk the plaintiff would have developed many psychological problems and that as a result, damages should be reduced since it is not likely the plaintiff would have completed his education and led a productive life\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "146  The plaintiff rejects this position, noting that despite his dysfunctional background and school truancy, Devon was never a problem student at school, had never required any mental health treatment pre-accident, and had a bright future ahead. In effect, says the plaintiff, although Devon may have a thin skull - an \"egg shell personality\" - owing to his dysfunctional family and school attendance issues, he did not have pre-existing anxiety, depression or somatoform illness symptoms that support a claim that his current psychological condition would have developed in any event\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "147  In support of its position, the defence notes the overwhelming evidence from Devon's various teachers that the unhealthy father-child relationship between Devon and Hussack Sr. was hampering Devon's social and emotional development. The father would not allow Devon any independence so as to grow and learn from his own mistakes. He was always around the school, hovering, watching out for Devon and fighting his battles-whether with the teachers or fellow students. Devon was not allowed to take responsibility for his own actions\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "148  Dr. O'Shaughnessy could not say precisely what triggered Devon's school avoidance. In his opinion Devon's school avoidance may have been an anxiety-related, family-related, mood disorder-related, or perhaps a delinquency or conduct disorder-related phenomenon. Regardless, in his view, the critical factor is the striking absenteeism from school for a number of years - a phenomenon known as school refusal. In his opinion, due to the high association between this degree of school refusal and psychiatric illnesses of different types, there was cause for serious concern here. Since Devon was exhibiting somatic complaints and stress complaints related to school refusal for approximately 22 years prior to the incident, he concludes that by the date of the accident, Devon was \"beyond the vulnerability stage\" and was likely already exhibiting signs of a developing psychiatric illness\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "149  Dr. O'Shaughnessy's opinion appears to rest largely on the literature which he says supports the conclusion that cases of school refusal in adolescents are associated with high rates of mental disorder or psychiatric illness, regardless of the presence or absence of anxiety\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "150  Particularly helpful was the evidence of Dr. Joshko, the defence neuropsychologist who conducted neuropsychological testing in this case. In his view, the modern models of school refusal include four basic types of child: (i) the child who does not want to be at school because there is something there which is anxiety provoking or which causes some strong negative effect; (ii) the child who refuses to go because he is sensitive to or uncomfortable with the social situation at school or who simply wishes to avoid an evaluation component (ie. a test); (iii) the child who refuses to attend school in an effort to gain attention from his parents; and (iv) finally the child who will not go because he would rather do other things - ie. watch TV, play video games etc. The latter two types of school refusal are not related to anxiety. In any case, Dr. Joshko agreed that there is a robust debate which continues to brew in the professional community concerning the definition and conceptualization of school refusal\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "151  Dr. Krywaniuk, a psychologist retained by the plaintiff, insisted that school refusal implied some level of anxiety in the child. This was a matter of some significance in his view since this feature appeared to be absent in Devon's case\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "152  In my view, both Dr. Joshko's and Dr. O'Shaughnessy's evidence support the conclusion that anxiety is not a necessary feature of school refusal. In other words there can be school refusal without anxiety\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "153  However even accepting that Devon may have suffered school refusal as an adolescent in the absence of any anxiety, there is still little or no hard evidence that Devon was actually exhibiting the early signs of signs of a psychiatric illness or somatoform disorder prior to the incident. On cross examination, even Dr. O'Shaughnessy conceded that in most cases of school refusal the adolescent does present with symptoms of anxiety or depression\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "154  While the evidence is clear that Devon missed a good deal of school and that his teachers and the school administrators were indeed concerned, none of them have described anything approaching anti-social, anxious or depressive behaviour on his part, or anything which would suggest the early signs of an emerging disorder or psychiatric illness. To the contrary all of the teachers described Devon as a very pleasant boy who, although not blessed with a wide group of friends, still presented as a quiet, studious, and apparently happy youth in the school environment, at least when he was there. None of the teachers testified that Devon was a problem youth, that there were any disciplinary problems, or that he demonstrated any fear of or hatred for the school environment. The school counsellor found no reason to ever offer Devon any counselling. As most every teacher testified, the problem was not Devon, the problem was his father and the bizarre father-child relationship which robbed Devon of an opportunity for the development of independence and personal autonomy\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "155  Devon's friend, Sergio Castillo, who was a fellow student in Grade 7, described Devon as one of his best friends. He said that Devon was very polite and at least in his view, he seemed to be a \"pretty popular guy\". So far as he was aware, Devon seemed to like school and did not seem fearful of school. While he admitted that Devon and others in their group of friends endured various conflicts with a group of skateboarders at school, not unlike any adolescents in conflicting cliques, he did not identify Devon as being particularly victimized or upset by these conflicts\n",
      "======\n",

      "\n",
      "157  In the end result, while Devon may well have been exhibiting signs of school refusal prior to the incident, I am unable to conclude that those school refusal features support a finding that even before the field hockey incident, he was exhibiting the signs of a developing somatoform disorder which would have naturally developed and evolved in any event. That theory is simply not borne out by the evidence. Thus the defence's crumbling skull claim cannot succeed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "158  In my view, the dysfunctional family dynamic did however leave Devon with a thin skull, making him more vulnerable generally to psychological damage resulting from his physical injury suffered during the field hockey incident, than would normally be expected. However, the fact that a plaintiff's thin skull condition was exacerbated by the actions of a family member, such as a parent or spouse, does not negate or minimize the defendant's liability\n",

      "159  For example, in Malcolm and another v. Broadhurst, [1970] 3 All E.R. 508, the husband and wife were injured by the negligent driving of the defendant. As a result of the head injuries he suffered, the husband suffered a significant cognitive loss and a change in personality, including the development of a violent temper. The wife had a pre-existing nervous disturbance which was exacerbated by the accident. While her physical injuries healed, she was ultimately rendered incapacitated solely because of the effect of her husband's changed behaviour on her vulnerable personality. Addressing the issue of the causation of her financial losses following the healing of her physical injuries, the Court said this at 511:\n",
      "The defendant must take the wife as he finds her and there is no difference in principle between an egg-shell skull and an egg-shell personality ... Exacerbation of her nervous depression was a readily foreseeable consequence of injuring her. Does the fact that it was caused, or caused to continue, by reaction to the husband's pathological bad-temper (itself the result of the defendant's negligence) put a stop to the defendant's liability? I think not\n",

It was noted that the parents' excessive anxiety over the incident contributed to the boy's worsening psychological condition. In a particularly relevant passage, the court wrote at 536:\n",
      "Notwithstanding the Wagon Mound (No 1) it is settled law that the defendant must take the plaintiff as he finds him: Smith v. Leech Brain & CO. Ltd. [1962] 2 QB 405 at 415; Beavis v. Apthorpe (at 857). The rule of the 'egg shell skull cases' should not be confined to the physical or constitutional characteristics of the particular individual. When a defendant takes a plaintiff as he finds him, he does not take him as a naked human being divorced from his environment. Clearly enough taking the plaintiff as you find him involves taking him in at least his social and earning capacity setting. The defendant who is unfortunate enough to run down a millionaire must pay accordingly. In such a case the defendant pays although the capacity which the plaintiff had was unknown or even knowable. I think that the defendant must take the plaintiff with all his weaknesses, beliefs and reactions as well as his capacities and attributes, physical, social and economic. If the result of an accident is that a ten year old boy reacts to his parents' concern over his injuries and develops an hysterical condition, no reason of justice, morality or entrenched principle appears to me to prevent his recovery of compensation\n",

The defence points to the number of ways in which, since the time of the accident, Hussack Sr. has contributed to the evolution of Devon's initial symptoms: by disregarding the advice of Devon's medical practitioners (in particular to obtain psychological treatment for the child); failing to attend follow up appointments with a number of doctors; failing to encourage Devon to comply with treatments; encouraging Devon's ever increasing dysfunctional lifestyle; obsessing over his symptoms and conditions; and failing to require that Devon attend school following the accident. The defence says none of this was foreseeable\n",

So long as the actions were foreseeable, the plaintiff says that the extent of the reaction nor the manner of the reaction need be foreseeable. The plaintiff says that for some number of years the defendant knew Hussack Sr. was overprotective, over caring and over solicitous\n",

      "164  Regarding the \"family cases\", I note that in Yoshikawa, Lambert J.A.'s remarks concerning \"a new intervening act\" arising from the \"advice and actions of family, friends and healers\" are entirely dicta and have no bearing on either the facts of the case or the outcome. The dicta appears in the judgment in the context of a discussion of the principle of proximate cause. (The dicta in Yoshikawa is discussed and accepted by Cole J. in MacLean)\n",

      "165  In Sammartino, Williamson J. refers to that dicta in Yoshikawa in the context of considering the defendant's third party claim against the infant plaintiff's parents. The defendant submitted that the infant plaintiff's recovery was stymied by his own parents' negligent actions in interfering with the rehabilitation and overprotecting him-actions which the defence characterized as an intervening act which (to use the language of Lambert J.A.) gave \"'such pronounced new impetus or deflection to the chain of causation' that the original wrongful act of the defendant can no longer be regarded legally as the cause of Sammy's condition\" (para. 95). I note that Williamson J. does not specifically adopt that reasoning, nor does he decide whether, as the defence submitted, such an intervening act must be a negligent one. Since the Court determined the parents' actions were prudent, appropriate and commendable, the novus actus interveniens defence theme failed entirely without the Court even addressing the issue of the parents' negligence, if any\n",

      "167  The more interesting case is Duwyn. There a mother left her 4-month-old son (the infant plaintiff) seated in the lap of his grandmother in the family car, with the 4-year-old son in the back seat, while she left to perform an errand. In her absence, the defendant backed his vehicle into the driver's side door of the vehicle in which the infant plaintiff was seated, denting it and breaking the window, scattering glass inside. The infant plaintiff immediately began to cry. While he was not physically injured, he was very upset and cried continuously. A short time later the mother returned to the vehicle. She became hysterical and was unable to comfort the infant. He went on to develop a full blown behavioural disorder\n",

      "\n",
      "168  Evidence was led that the mother's profound reaction to the circumstances of the accident were rooted in an experience which occurred when she was 14-years-old and while ironing, left her two-year-old brother unattended while she answered the telephone. The baby touched the iron and burned himself so badly he required plastic surgery. Being the eldest of her four siblings and effectively responsible for much of the mothering in the home, she carried that guilt into adulthood. The accident in question reawakened that old emotional response and caused her extreme reaction\n",

      "170  On appeal, the Ontario Court of Appeal considered the issue of whether the mother's actions constituted an intervening force. On a review of the whole of the evidence, the Court held at 753 that \"... what turned out to be the ineffective response of two ... conscientious, sensitive and loving parents to Brent's condition cannot realistically be considered to be outside the bounds of reasonable foreseeability\". While the Court characterized the mother's reaction as extreme, profound and even abnormal, this parental conduct could not be considered as an intervening force. As Morden J.A. notes at 753, \"... it can fairly be seen from the evidence as a whole that what 'produced' the eventual condition was parental ineffectiveness characterized by an inability to be firm with Brent-and this cannot, in my view, be considered to be an effective intervening cause at law\"\n",

C.A.) where the plaintiffs, three brothers, were passengers in the defendant's car during an accident. The defendant died, but the plaintiffs sustained no more than minimal physical injuries. The plaintiffs were young people, though of working age, and lived at home with their mother. The plaintiff's mother was \"neurotic and obsessed\" with the consequences of the accident. The Court concluded that her actions produced a \"morbid atmosphere\" in the family home which \"prevented the plaintiffs from naturally healing from the shock and nervousness\" they sustained as a result of the accident. The plaintiffs all suffered from dizziness, shyness, occasional blackouts and other symptoms resulting in an inability to work for a number of years\n",

The Court concluded that had the plaintiffs' symptoms not been exaggerated and perpetuated by them under the influence of and at the instigation of their mother, they would have resolved within a few months or at most, one year. The Court rejected the notion that the \"family hysteria\" was simply part of the circumstances of the case. As the court concluded: \"[w]hile it was true that a tortfeasor had to take his victim as he found him, he did not have to take his family.\" Thus it concluded the family hysteria which arose in this case was not foreseeable and broke the chain of causation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "173  On these authorities, the defence submits that the Court ought to find that Mr. Hussack Sr.'s actions were \"outside the bounds of reasonable foreseeability\" and caused the development of Devon's somatoform illness. Unlike the situation in Duwyn the defence submits Hussack Sr.'s actions were not foreseeable, were totally outside the normal bounds of parental behaviour and actively operated to produce harm to Devon\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "174  First, I must note that in the circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that Hussack Sr.'s gross over-reaction to Devon's injuries was unforeseeable. For many years before the accident, the defendant had witnessed and struggled with Hussack Sr.'s over-protectiveness towards Devon, his overbearing attitude and his rejection of any school based advice as to how to properly support his son at school. School administrators and teachers were all familiar with his idiosyncratic behaviours. Following the accident this pattern of behaviour shifted to pursuing a proper medical diagnosis of Devon's injury, which he was convinced was a brain injury. As Dr. Foti testified, where a child has been injured, it is not at all unusual for a parent to doggedly pursue medical information, perform internet searches, insist on medical investigations, and keep journals of symptoms observed. Hussack Sr. did all of this, except in a highly exaggerated, obsessive fashion\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "175  Second, I should note that I place no reliance on the McLaren decision. I agree with Professor Cooper - Stephenson's comment in Personal Injury Damages in Canada, 2nd ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Carswell, 1996) at 908, that this case appears to stand apart from the weight of authority. The vast majority of the decisions which have been decided since McLaren have either ignored it, distinguished it, or flatly refused to follow it. In particular I note the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision in Nader (which I will address below), which criticized the finding in McLaren that the family hysteria was not foreseeable, thus failing to observe the rule that the precise cause need not be foreseen (the Hughes v. Lord Advocate rule)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "176  Regarding the Duwyn decision, the defence submits that contrary to the case at bar, the impugned parental misconduct in Duwyn was not outside the bounds of parental behaviour. I do not agree\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "177  While the mother's actions in Duwyn were ultimately characterized by Morden J.A. as merely ineffective parenting, the expert evidence was clear that the mother's own psychological demons had resulted in \"a rather extreme reaction\" to her baby's accident (adopting the phrase used by the family and child psychiatrist who testified at trial). Not only was she extremely upset and unable to cope at the scene but she remained unable to properly parent the baby for many months thereafter\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "178  Further, it must be noted that the facts in Duwyn ruled out any thin skull analysis. While the mother's hypersensitivity pre-dated the accident, her impugned parental behaviour did not. Her inappropriate (and ultimately damaging) parental behaviour was precipitated by the accident and did not pre-date it. By contrast, in the case at bar, Hussack Sr.'s over-caring, over-protective and over-solicitous behaviour predated the accident and was well known to the defendant School District. In other words the Hussack family dynamic created a thin skull situation for Devon which clearly pre-dated the field hockey accident. Accordingly, the doctrine of novus actus interveniens has no application to Hussack Sr.'s post-accident actions\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "179  Further, while the intervening cause issue was an important one in Duwyn (although ignored in Wilson J.A's concurring reasons), in my view the far more fundamental and threshold issue which the Court grappled with at the outset of that decision concerned the foreseeability of the infant plaintiff's injury of nervous shock. In the end result, the parental conduct was not characterized as an intervening act since it was foreseeable. At 752 Morden J.A. noted:\n",
      "... I have relatively little difficulty in concluding that an accident of the kind which happened, in which the defendant's car collided with that of the plaintiffs with sufficient intensity to cause the glass to shatter throughout it, which itself was clearly foreseeable, was one which also carried with it foreseeability of some injury from nervous shock for a person such as [the infant plaintiff]. Obviously this initial shock developed into a mental disorder of a very serious nature. It is not a requirement of the foreseeability test that the defendant foresee the precise kind or severity of shock 'so long as some shock sufficiently substantial to qualify for redress actually was foreseeable'\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "180  Indeed in her concurring reasons, Wilson J.A. (as she then was) found it unnecessary to address the issue of intervening cause, and focused solely on the issue of foreseeability, as she noted at 738 and 739:\n",
      "The more difficult question is whether the full extent of the injury is compensable in light of the medical evidence that, but for the conduct of the mother, the infant's initial state of anxiety and insecurity would have been short lived?\n",
      "...\n",
      "Having concluded, therefore, that this case is one of liability for an unforeseeable degree of damage of a foreseeable type, and that aggravated injury resulting from the abortive ministrations of the mother was reasonably foreseeable within the principle of the Wagon Mound, I would reach the same result as my colleague and allow the infant plaintiff full recovery for the full extent of his injuries\n",

      "181  The last two family cases which require consideration are Nader and Malcolm\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "182  In Nader, the 10-year-old plaintiff suffered minor injuries, including superficial head injuries, as a result of a fall on February 24, 1978, when he jumped from a moving school bus before it stopped. He hit his head against the bus stop pole. Within a short period he began to exhibit symptoms of a psychiatric illness known as Ganser Syndrome, a pseudo dementia. The Court concluded that while the boy's initial complaints of headache, dizziness and difficulty in concentration probably had an organic basis in the beginning, the pseudo dementia \"gradually took over\", as the parents' concern, over protectiveness and notions of compensation were ever present. For the purposes of the judgment, the Court assumed that if the plaintiff had been separated from his parents, he would have recovered. Regarding the issue of causation, the Court said at 531:\n",
      "While it is true that the condition would not have arisen without the presence of the father, it is equally true that it would not have arisen 'but for' the accident ... I am satisfied that the accident and its immediate consequences were a cause of the onset of the Ganser Syndrome. The highest that the defendant's case can be put is that the accident and its consequences caused the plaintiff's parents to act in a way which caused the plaintiff to develop the condition known as the Ganser Syndrome. That still means that there is a causal connection between the defendant's negligence and the plaintiff's condition\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "183  The Court continues at 536:\n",
      "Moreover, I think that it was certainly foreseeable that an accident to a ten year old boy would bring about a reaction from his parents. If the plaintiff's condition is attributable either in whole or in part to the attitude of the parents, then I think that it is one of the consequences of the defendant's negligence which was within its reasonable foresight. A defendant is liable even for indirect damage which is the product of consequences which can be reasonably foreseen: The Wagon Mound (No 1) (at 426)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "184  The defence submits this case is not binding here, firstly on the ground that the finding of liability was decided on the basis of the application of the material contribution test which, following the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke, is no longer the causation test in Canada. While I agree the New South Wales Court of Appeal found liability by applying the material contribution test, the actual causation analysis was much more nuanced. At 530 and 531 of the decision, McHugh J.A. reviews the legal history of the various theories of causation, culminating in the \"more practical\" \"but for\" test. He concludes that :\n",
      "In the present case, I am satisfied that on the application of these tests the negligence of the defendant materially contributed in fact to the onset and maintenance of the Ganser Syndrome ... While it is true that the condition would not have arisen without the presence of the father, it is equally true that it would not have arisen \"but for\" the accident ... [emphasis added].\n",
      "In effect, while ultimately applying the material contribution test, the Court applied a variety of tests, including the \"but for\" test, finally concluding that the accident was the \"cause-in-fact\" of the development of the Gansner Syndrome. The fact that in Nader, the material contribution test was the prevailing causation test in that jurisdiction, does not detract from the Court's causation analysis which is helpful here\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "185  The defence also suggests the Nader decision is of limited assistance since, as Mahoney J.A. noted there, none of the family's behaviour was adduced in evidence during trial. The defence contrasts that situation with that in the case at bar where a number of teachers and physicians testified directly concerning Hussack Sr.'s bizarre overprotective behaviour which led to the development of Devon's somatoform syndrome\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "186  I do not accept that the Court in Nader was operating without fulsome evidence concerning the boy's parents. As Mahoney J.A. noted at 519:\n",
      "The trial did not proceed upon the basis of the proof, by direct evidence from witnesses who observed the relevant facts, either of what the parents said and did to the plaintiff at relevant times or of the nature of the family relationships. These matters were detailed in the written material which was admitted into evidence [emphasis added]\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "187  Thus there was evidence before the Court. While the evidence concerning the parents' actions was mixed, ultimately it was sufficient for the Court to assume, for the purposes of judgment, that if the plaintiff had been separated from his parents, his recovery would have followed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "188  Finally, in Malcolm, also discussed above, the defendant was found liable for both physical injuries and severe psychological damage suffered by the plaintiff wife as a result of changes to her husband's personality arising from the injuries he suffered in the accident. The Court held at 511:\n",
      "Once damage of a particular kind, in this case psychological, can be foreseen, as here it could, the fact that it arises or is continued by reason of an unusual complex of events does not avail the defendant, Hughes v. Lord Advocate. Moreover, it is not beyond the range of reasonable anticipation to foresee that if one does severe injury to husband and wife, when the wife is tempermentally unstable, her instability may be adversely affected by the injury done to the husband ..\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "189  The defendant has not succeeded in demonstrating that Hussack Sr.'s actions amount to a new intervening act. Hussack Sr.'s over-bearing, over-protective tendencies were well-known to the defendant prior to the field hockey incident. Moreover, as held in Nader and Malcolm, it is not \"beyond the range of reasonable anticipation\" to foresee that a parent would react strongly to their child suffering an injury. That this reaction was extreme in this case was foreseeable, and it does not break the chain of causation.\n",
      "XIII. Conclusions on causation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "190  In the end result, on a review of all of the authorities, I have reached several conclusions:\n",
      "the plaintiff has met the burden of proving that his present mental illness was not pre-existing in nature;\n",
      "there is no evidence that the plaintiff is malingering or that he is otherwise feigning his injuries or is otherwise able without intensive treatment to overcome his injuries;\n",
      "it is foreseeable that the plaintiff's initial mild concussion and resulting concussive symptoms would arise from a hit to the head with a field hockey stick.\n",
      "it is also foreseeable that a parent (and particularly this parent who was well known to the defendant) would react to the injury to his son (It is not unusual in today's world for such a reaction to include intensive Internet research, journaling of symptoms and excessive medical consultations with various specialists);\n",
      "but for the blow to the head and the mild concussion (and other concussive symptoms which followed), the father would not have reacted and the plaintiff would not have developed the somatoform illness\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "191  Thus I conclude that the plaintiff has met the burden of proving that the field hockey incident was both the cause-in-fact and the cause-in-law of the plaintiff's injuries and that they are therefore compensable in law. As noted earlier, relative to issues of foreseeability, one does not have to foresee the extent or the manner of occurrence. However, in this case, when one factors in the unusual fact that there was a substantial history between the representatives of the defendant School District and the parent, Hussack Sr.'s over-protectiveness, over-solicitousness, and over-caring behaviour is also foreseeable, although not part of the foreseeability test.\n",

      "192  The plaintiff submits that he is entitled to damages for the initial mild concussion and related symptoms, as well as the somatic injuries which developed very quickly, eventually evolving into a full blown undifferentiated somatoform disorder\n",

      "193  By contrast the defendant submits its liability for damages ought to be limited to the specific injuries caused in the field hockey accident, that is a mild concussion involving the swelling and bruising of the forehead, headaches, as well as some minor dizziness and photophobia complaints. Relying on the evidence of Dr. Keyes, the defence says that in the normal course, these specific injuries ought to have resolved within a period of approximately 3-6 months. Assuming the damages are so limited, the defence submits an appropriate award for non pecuniary damages ought to be in the range of $15,000-$20,000 (Brinkman v. Rollings, ; Moate v. Wal-Mart Canada Inc. ; Gee v. Elvira, ; Adolph v. Scotchman, ; Macalanda v. Fulgar, ; Willeson v. Calgary (City), )\n",

      "\n",
      "194  For much the same reasons as I noted earlier in addressing the causation issue, I am unable to isolate the symptoms directly related to the mild concussion injury from the somatic symptoms which followed. As Dr. Foti noted, even in the immediate post-accident phase, it is difficult here to unravel the post-concussion symptoms from the somatic symptoms since they are essentially intertwined. As I have chronicled earlier in these reasons, the immediate mild headache evolved and morphed over a brief period to include continuing headaches, head pain, photophobia, shaking and tremours, temperature control issues, and generalized joint pain\n",

      "He basically has no structure or set pattern to his day. He will never rise or go to bed at any set pattern and eating habits are variable day to day. He engages in virtually no activity or exercise. His only exercise appears to be going on the treadmill once every two weeks for anywhere from two to ten minutes duration. He rarely leaves the home and claims that even walking up the block is too demanding. At this point, his father quite literally waits on him 24 hours a day to the degree where his father does all the cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc and prepares (Devon's) food and brings it to him. Father and son indicate this pattern has been going on for some time as they feel (Devon's) joints get too sore when he climbs down stairs to obtain food and/or his tremor limits him from carrying any liquids or pouring liquids etc. ...

Dr. Nairne Stewart has opined that even with prolonged and intensive treatment, there is only a \"minor hope that (Devon) might again become functional\".

      "207  For many years before the accident Devon had missed significant portions of his school classes and as he reached the end of middle school ,he was having more and more difficulty keeping up with course work and meeting school-based criteria. My sense is that Hussack Sr. (and by extension Devon) had a false or at least an exaggerated sense of Devon's academic ability, thus justifying his absenteeism and unfortunately reinforcing his difficulty completing his schoolwork. Ironically Hussack Sr. developed various methods to shore up Devon's performance-working with him in the library over the lunch hour, sometimes completing his school assignment for him at home, and insisting the teachers provide Devon with ongoing support to identify the gaps in his work and keep pace with his classmates\n",

      "208  By way of case in point, Devon's math teacher suggested he join the Odyssey of the Mind school competition in the early part of his Grade 7 year. Any student was free to seek membership on the school team which was expected to solve various problems using a multi-team approach. While Devon insisted he had been doing well in this \"battle of intellectuals\" and was headed for a large provincial competition when the accident intervened, his math teacher revealed a different reality. He said that while Devon was indeed a very bright creative lad who obviously enjoyed the Odyssey experience, his failure to attend the team preparation meetings on any regular basis had finally cost him a place on the team. Following the first two competitions, just as the pressure mounted and the team relied more heavily on his attendance and participation, Devon's attendance dropped. The teacher finally pulled him off the active team member list. Devon did not compete in any of the competitions after December 1997, some four months before the accident. Whether Devon had simply forgotten the history of his Odyssey of the Mind involvement, or whether he has unconsciously reconstructed those events to bolster his own self esteem, or whether he simply lied, I cannot say\n",

A student is now on his own, attending classes, completing assignments and meeting exam schedules relying on his own self discipline and the study habits engrained during the high school years. All of this was lacking in Devon's case. I do not expect that given his own inflated perception of his academic talents (supported by his father's overly protective attitude) as well as his parents' chronic failure to ever insist on and support regular school attendance, Devon would have likely pursued education beyond high school\n",

      "219  Mr. Struthers of Associated Economic Consultants has applied a particular deduction to the estimated future earnings, reflecting either the average effects of contingencies for both choices and risks or the average effects of contingencies for risks alone (Exhibit 4, Tab 5A). During submissions, plaintiff's counsel agreed that based on the authorities, the \"risks only\" projections were not applicable (Bohun v. Sennewald, , ); Whetung v.

Landy has many years of experience as a rehabilitation nurse and is an expert in the field of rehabilitation case management. Despite her many years of experience and the hours she spent meeting with Devon and his father in their home, Landy admitted that at the conclusion of her assessment she was simply unable to predict or recommend any particular future care program, nor provide any estimate of the costs in a standard cost of care report. Rather she has costed out the recommendations made by various physicians who have assessed Devon in preparation for trial\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "227  Six particular items emerge: the behavioural program recommended by Dr. O'Shaughnessy, an exercise program, a social activation program, educational/vocational assessment and consultation, pain management program, and home care.\n",
      "Behavioural Program\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "228  Landy explained there are no hospital in-patient behavioural programs in British Columbia. Rather the programs are community-based. Initially Devon would be admitted to hospital and would be assessed by a psychiatric team in an acute care environment for three months or longer. A behavioural treatment program would be established by a hospital-based psychiatrist who would then work with a community-based psychologist to implement the behavioural program. Landy assessed the cost of the initial assessment by a psychologist at $3500-$6250, to be followed by regular sessions with the psychologist at $125-$275 per hour. She expected the program would carry a total cost ranging from $15,000-$20,000. There is no dispute that this component of the future care program is required. I will award $15,000 under this head.\n",
      "Exercise Program\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "229  As I noted earlier, Devon has adopted an extremely sedentary lifestyle over the last number of years. Dr. O'Shaughnessy recommended the institution of a physical activation program, both to address the issues of chronic pain as well as provide some structure to his day. While Dr. O'Shaughnessy did not specifically recommend the need for a physiotherapist, I agree that in this very complex case, given the wide scope of the physical complaints and Devon's dramatic deconditioning, a physiotherapist would be required to perform an initial assessment and design an appropriate program. The physiotherapist would instruct a kinesiologist or personal fitness trainer regarding the nature, frequency and length of the program. From time to time the trainer would meet with the physiotherapist to redesign or restructure the program as required. Landy has estimated the cost of the physiotherapist at $110 per hour and the kinesiologist at $70 per hour plus GST\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "230  While Landy has not estimated the specific length of the program, plaintiff's counsel has estimated 100 hours for same, resulting in a total claim under this head of $11,000. The defence submits that since there is no evidence specifically supporting any particular program or hours of same, it follows that the plaintiff has failed to meet the burden of proof and this claim should be denied. I do not agree. There is ample evidence this young man requires assistance in regaining some use of his body and some professional support and encouragement will be required to meet this end. As a matter of common sense, I expect that this will be a challenging lengthy exercise. I accept that $10,000 is likely a reasonable estimate of the costs involved, given the hourly rates of the physiotherapist and fitness trainer who will be involved.\n",
      "Social Activation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "231  Dr. O'Shaughnessy has also recommended that Devon requires a social activation program. He has been largely isolated at home for the last several years, but for his trips outside the home for haircuts and medical appointments. Nevertheless I am not persuaded there is any need for a separate award under this head. I note that Devon has recently met a young woman online and she has travelled to visit with him in the home for three weeks in October 2008 for three weeks and some five weeks in January-February 2009. Assuming the support of this young woman, as well as the professional support of the psychologist, physiotherapist and fitness trainer, I expect there will be ample opportunities for Devon to get out of the home and reintegrate into society without the need of any additional formal program.\n",
      "Vocational Assessment\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "232  Regarding the vocational assessment however, I agree that some professional assistance from is required. While Devon is very bright and continues to spend long hours following political development and current affairs online, the reality is that he has been outside the educational system for 11 years. At this point it is not clear what employment, if any, he would be capable of undertaking\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "233  As Dr. Krywaniuk noted, Devon requires a comprehensive rehabilitation program to deal with his emotional, social, educational and vocational challenges. Such a program would focus on his potential competitive employability or perhaps his ability to undertake a volunteer position. An educational consultant would determine what educational programs or career training programs might be undertaken. A vocational consultant would assess his aptitudes, identify his limitations, liaise with any potential employer and provide the employer with any support required on an ongoing basis\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "234  Landy has costed out the initial vocational assessment at $1200-$1500 plus the ongoing consultation to assist in vocational placement at $75-$100 per hour. She prices the educational consultant at $125-$135 per hour plus GST. She has not however specifically costed out a program since, as she has testified, it is impossible for her to predict what lies ahead\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "235  However adopting those figures, plaintiff's counsel submits a total claim of $25,000 as follows: $11,500 for initial vocational assessment and 100 hours of ongoing vocational consultation; and $13,500 for 100 hours of assistance from educational consultant\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "236  I do not accept the defence submission that Devon is able to find whatever support he requires in the community in the form of various publicly-funded programs. Doing the best I can with the information at hand, I award $15,000 under this head of damage.\n",
      "Pain Management Program\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "237  Adopting the recommendations of Dr. Joshko, Landy has costed out a comprehensive non residential pain management programs at approximately $17,850. I am not persuaded that any such program is required. All of the doctors involved have agreed that Devon suffers a somatoform disorder and that there is no physical basis for his complaints of pain. Neither Dr. Wade or Dr. Stuart have recommended a pain management program. The only individual who has made this recommendation is Dr. Joshko who is a psychologist. I find there is no evidence supporting this claim.\n",
      "Home Support/Exterior Maintenance\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "238  Defence counsel seeks an award of $778,723 for ongoing homecare support, based on Landy's costing out of a daily housekeeper for three hours at $29.93, including GST. Mr. Gibbens submits that given his bleak prognosis and his father's poor health, someone will eventually have to replace Hussack Sr., who does far more than three hours of work a day waiting on Devon's needs\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "239  I have difficulty with this submission. First Hussack Sr.'s description of the many services he performs for Devon spring from his own insistence in and reinforcement of a belief that Devon is physically disabled. The behavioural program will be removing this false belief system and rehabilitating Devon. While it is true that the prognosis is bleak, there is no expert evidence before me to support a continuation of this particular dynamic which can only reinforce Devon's perception of his plight\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "240  Further Landy only suggested that this home care support be provided to Devon in the initial stages of his rehabilitation, assuming he left the family home and relocated to his own apartment or home. Until such time as his physical conditioning and social activation programs had prepared him to undertake the tasks of day to day living-home cleaning, grocery shopping, meal preparation, etc., the home care support worker would fill the gap. It is notable however that this home care support has not been recommended by any of the experts who have weighed in here\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "241  Given the lack of any professional recommendation for this item and the fact that it rests on an assumption Devon will live alone in the early stages of his rehabilitation (which I do not accept will necessarily be the case), I am not satisfied the plaintiff has proven the necessary evidentiary foundation for this claim.\n",
      "XVIII. Summary - Future Care Costs\n",
      "======\n",

      "242  In summary, I have made the following awards:\n",

      "\n",
      "243  Relying on the decision in Crane v. Worwood ,  (S.C.), the plaintiff seeks an award of $10,000 as compensation for the many services which Hussack Sr. has provided to his son over the years since the accident, services which it is submitted are outside the normal duties of family members, were needed because of the injuries at hand, and would have been required to be provided by someone outside the family, had Hussack Sr. not done so (Brito v. Woolley, )\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "244  Adopting the cautious and restrained approach which must be taken to such \"in trust\" claims (Gill v. Probert  (S.C.)), I do not accept that such an award ought to be made in this case\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "245  I note that even to the present date, Hussack Sr. testified that he spends 1.5 hours daily preparing Devon's breakfast, a further hour preparing lunch and finally 2-3 hours preparing dinner. He carries meals and dishes back and forth to Devon's room, sets the shower temperature to prevent him from scalding himself and attends on his every need. While I do not accept these wildly exaggerated accounts of the time Hussack Sr. spends servicing Devon's daily needs, his description of the services provided is nevertheless disturbing since, as Dr. O'Shaughnessy has testified, Hussack Sr. has effectively infantilized his son and this dynamic has contributed both to the development and persistence of his ongoing disability\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "246  While I have resolved the causation issue in Devon's favour, it remains that Hussack Sr.'s own overly protective and overly solicitous attitudes and actions have played a role in creating Devon's original vulnerable mental state, his reaction to the head injury, and the reinforcement of the somatoform complaints which followed. His continued obsessive attending on Devon has only reinforced this disability. In these circumstances I agree with the defence that it would be entirely inappropriate that Hussack Sr. be compensated for the services provided.\n",
      "XX. Mitigation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "247  The defence submits that the overall award of damages in this case ought to be reduced by some 30-40% in respect of the damages which accrued prior to 2003 (when he became an adult) and thereafter by some 50%, by virtue of his failure to take appropriate steps to mitigate his damages in this case\n",

Evers, ). Then from 2003 onwards the defence says that Devon was required, like any other adult, to take whatever recommendations were made to mitigate his damages\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "249  The defence does not fault Devon for failing to seek psychiatric treatment for the somatoform illness once it became entrenched. It accepts that an individual's failure to accept underlying psychological reasons for his symptoms and his continued attempts to find an organic cause for his difficulties are simply part of his somatoform illness (Samuel)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "250  Rather the defence submits that Devon's failure lay in his refusal to follow any of his doctors' advice over the years-to follow an exercise program, to regularly attend medical appointments, to attend school and maintain a normal lifestyle, to follow the recommended drug treatment program for depression, and finally to attend counselling. The defence position is that had Devon truly believed his symptoms were from a brain injury, he had a duty to implement the recommendations of his physician which were aimed at alleviating his symptoms. In contrast to the plaintiff in Samuel who actively pursued every possible means of alleviating what she believed to be a physical disability, the defence says Devon took no such steps\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "251  I have some difficulty with this argument since the injury occurred at a time when Devon was only 13-years-old, and as I have noted earlier, was already the product of an unhealthy parent-child dynamic, which had made him psychologically over dependent on his father. As Dr. Krywaniuk testified, it is not likely Devon had the insight or judgment required to understand what was happening to him nor how he was becoming increasingly dependent on his father. By the time he reached adulthood, the somatoform illness was well entrenched. I see Devon's failure to act on and accept the many recommendations made by his physicians, including consulting with a psychologist, as reflections of that disorder, entirely reinforced if not supported by his father. If one focuses solely on the recommendations directed to improving his physical condition, it must be said that it is unlikely any of those recommendations would have assisted to any significant degree, given the ongoing psychiatric illness and the lack of any treatment for that illness\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "252  In the end result, I will not reduce the award made to reflect any failure on Devon's part to mitigate his loss.\n",

While there is no evidence that Devon is legally incompetent, he is suffering a psychiatric illness and he clearly remains heavily dependent (both psychologically and physically) on his father. To that extent I am concerned that in future he may possibly have limited control of the award of damages which will be paid out in his favour. If counsel are able to obtain instructions to take steps to create a trust fund or structure some other vehicle for securing this damage award, I am prepared to entertain submissions to create a Court Order to formalize such an arrangement.

Parent rolls are large rolls of paper product which are stored until they can be returned to the Plant to be processed for packaging into the final product sold by Scott or until they can be shipped to other companies who use the paper to produce their own finished product. Once parent rolls and product were moved from the Plant to the Warehouse, they were moved by lift trucks and stored in stacks in the Warehouse\n",

      "8  Prior to engaging First and forwarding its product to the Warehouse for storage, handling and shipping, Scott had stored its products at the Plant or at various third party warehouses. In addition to storing the inventory of Scott at the Warehouse, First also provided labour, space management and shipping co-ordination services to Scott in what was described by First as a \"converting\" operation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "9  In order to handle the parent rolls, First employed one \"electric clamp\" forklift and one \"propane clamp\" forklift. The configuration of the propane clamp forklift was described at Trial as being a short wheelbase \"box car special\" that had the advantage of a shorter turning radius while having the identical lifting power of the electric clamp forklift\n",

      "\n",
      "10  At the end of August 2000, a Toyota propane forklift was leased by First from Mason to assist in the storage of parent rolls and product (\"Original Forklift\"). The Original Forklift was a stock Toyota propane forklift but prior to its arrival at First, the Original Forklift had been equipped with venting on the forward and side areas of the hood\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "11  When use of the Original Forklift began, lift truck operators noticed that it would overheat due to paper debris being sucked up into the body of the vehicle by the operation of the radiator cooling fan. From time to time, operators also noticed that they could smell paper smouldering within the machine as a result of contact with various hot elements associated with the engine and exhaust system. As a result of these occurrences, operators were forced to stop the Original Forklift and allow it to cool before cleaning it and putting it back into service\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "12  First sought assistance from Mason regarding these problems. After several visits to the Warehouse by Mason personnel in November 2000, a determination was made by First and Mason to obtain an air compressor to \"blow out\" the Original Forklift at various intervals and to have the exhaust pipe wrapped with fibreglass insulation in order to shield paper and debris from the hot surface of the exhaust pipe\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "13  Following implementation of the compressor and exhaust wrapping, the problem with smouldering paper was greatly reduced although instances of fires continued as a result of contact between paper and hot elements of the machine. Subsequent testing established that even a wrapped pipe would be hot enough to ignite paper. The overheating problem was also managed through the use of blowing out the machine with the compressor at the end of the shift and at intervals during the day\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "14  The evidence of various Scott employees regarding their use of compressors established that the practice of blowing down machines with compressed air as a response to overheating and smouldering paper or tissue paper fires within the machine was also adopted by Scott and was viewed as a reasonable response to this problem. Scott did not have any of the exhaust pipes on their propane forklifts wrapped with asbestos or fibreglass tape. It was the evidence of representatives of Mason that, notwithstanding their long relationship with Scott and others in the paper industry who handled similar material, Mason had never wrapped an exhaust pipe on a Toyota propane machine prior to wrapping the exhaust pipe on the Original Forklift\n",

Approximately one week prior to the Fire, an employee accidentally ran the Original Forklift into a structure within the Warehouse. The accident occurred on Friday, July 20, 2001. On Monday, July 23, 2001, Mason was called to the Warehouse for an inspection of the damaged Original Forklift. Following that inspection, Mason determined that the Original Forklift would have to be taken for repair.

The Forklift was owned by Mason and leased to First\n",

In this regard, Mr. Bodnar was asked the following questions and gave the following answers at his Examination for Discovery:\n",
      "Did you learn at some point in time prior to the fire that there was no wrapping on the exhaust pipe? No asbestos wrapping?\n",
      "Yes. The first day I did my inspection I noticed right away.\n",

      "You assumed that -\n",
      "It's a loaner machine. I doubt there's any other machines out there that had the pipe wrapped. That was just my opinion. Something I wouldn't even ask - this is a loaner, of course it's not going to be wrapped.\n",
      "Did that concern you, that you were going to be using -\n",
      "It did because I had concerns before we had it wrapped so I would use it. Sure enough, it started overheating right away.\n",

      "Yes. Uh-hum.\n",
      "Just the same as you had with the permanent lift truck?\n",

The Defendants state that the Warehouse Management Agreement included a provision requiring Scott to obtain insurance including \"insurance of its inventory and property within the Warehouse\" and that such insurance was to name First as an additional insured and was to stand as the primary insurance coverage. The Defendants state that, by the terms of the Warehouse Management Agreement, Scott is barred and otherwise estopped from claiming against First to the extent of the indemnity which would have been provided by such insurance. The Defendants state that it was an express or implied term of the Warehouse Management Agreement that the parties would restrict recovery between them for any loss or damage to the amount of available insurance and that Scott is therefore barred by the terms of the Warehouse Management Agreement and is otherwise estopped from claiming against the Defendants in total or, in the alternative, to the extent of the indemnity that would have been provided by the insurance that Scott was obliged to obtain and maintain under the terms of the Warehouse Management Agreement\n",

First submits that the Canadian Standard Contract Terms and Conditions for the Merchandise Warehousemen excludes liability for loss and damage due to fire, inherent defects, lack of special care or precaution, and injury to articles insufficiently protected or arising from the nature of the goods so that the alleged loss and damage claimed by Scott is excluded\n",

      "42  Regarding the alleged duty of care under the Act or as an occupier of the Warehouse under the Occupiers Liability Act, First states that it has satisfied any duty of care owed by it to Scott. In further answer, First states that Scott specified and directed that First use a Toyota forklift truck to perform work at the Warehouse and was at all times aware of the use by First of such a forklift truck and the risks inherent with its use. First also states that Scott at all material times had knowledge equal to or superior to that of First relating to the risks associated with the use of such trucks. In this regard, First submits that Scott operated several such forklifts every day at the Plant without wrapped pipes in identical or worse conditions of debris, Mason had never wrapped an exhaust pipe on a forklift other than the Original Forklift, Toyota never recommended or required that exhaust pipes of forklifts be wrapped, Toyota had not established the wrapping of exhaust pipes to be a solution to the problem of paper debris, and the \"blow down\" procedure used by First's staff was identical to the procedures employed by the personnel of Scott at the Plant\n",

Prior to occupying the Warehouse, various individuals at Scott met to determine how much product could be stored at the Warehouse. It is alleged by First that it was determined that the space available at the Warehouse was the same as the space that had been available at one of the previous warehouses managed by First and used by Scott. Because Scott had stored approximately six million pounds of parent roll material at the previous location, First states that Scott concluded that the same amount of product could be stored at the Warehouse if the parent rolls were stacked as high as 22-1/2 feet if 90 inch rolls were stacked three high and 60 inch rolls were stacked four high\n",

In particular, Scott failed to wrap the parent rolls in order to avoid paper sloughing off the rolls creating a housekeeping issue and fire hazard, it required the storage of parent rolls in such a quantity and configuration at the Warehouse with the knowledge that such quantity and configuration created an increased fire hazard, it sent parent rolls to the Warehouse in such quantities that Scott knew could not be stored safely or in compliance with \"instructions\" that Scott had received from its insurer, FMG Global, it demanded that First utilize a Toyota Series 6 forklift at the Warehouse when they knew or ought to have known the dangers of using such a forklift, and that Scott failed to warn First about the risks inherent with the use of Toyota Series 6 forklift trucks, including the Forklift.\n",

      "failure to take any or any reasonable steps to minimize the risk of paper and paper debris accumulating within the body of the Forklift;\n",
      "failure to take any or any reasonable steps to minimize the risk of ignition of paper and paper debris;\n",
      "failure to warn First of the risk of accumulation of paper and paper debris, and the ignition thereof, inherent in the use of the Forklift in a paper warehouse facility such as the Warehouse;\n",

      "WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "50  The exhaust system of the Original Forklift was known to get hot enough that paper that came in contact with it could smoulder and ignite. That was why it was decided by First to have Mason wrap the exhaust of the Original Forklift. Because First was handling domestic parent rolls that were not \"wrapped\", there was paper product in the aisles and against the bottom of the stacks of parent rolls in the Warehouse. Mr. Bodnar had immediate concerns regarding the Forklift: \"Sure enough, it started overheating right away.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "51  I find that it was paper debris coming into contact with the unwrapped exhaust system of the Forklift that caused the Fire. Burning tissue debris was seen by Mr. Nijjar to be trailing behind the Forklift. The fact that the burning paper was outside the Forklift, allows me to conclude that the paper had not been sucked up into the Forklift. This incident occurred only days after the Forklift had gone into service to replace the Original Forklift. This spatial and temporal proximity between the use of the Forklift with the unwrapped exhaust system and the burning paper is sufficient to allow me to come to the conclusion that the Fire was caused when paper came into contact with the unwrapped exhaust of the Forklift\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "52  An inspection of the Forklift following the Fire disclosed no evidence of fire within the Forklift. I find this to be further evidence that the Fire was caused by paper coming into contact with an external part of the Forklift. I find that the unprotected exhaust of the Forklift came into contact with paper debris, either in the location where Mr. Bodnar had deposited a parent roll or in the aisle as he moved the Forklift back to that part of the Warehouse where he was to pick up another parent roll. I find that the heat of the unprotected exhaust of the Forklift caused the paper which was in the aisle or which had been blown into the aisle from debris at the foot of a stack of parent rolls to ignite, the ignited paper landed at the base of a stack of parent rolls, the paper transferred the flame to the parent rolls, and the fire spread from there.\n",
      "WERE THERE OTHER POSSIBLE CAUSES OF THE FIRE\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "53  There were theories elicited from witnesses called by First that there were other causes of the Fire. Mr. West gave evidence concerning the possible role played by a melting plastic radiator coolant overflow hose within the Forklift. It was alleged that this overflow hose had been installed by Mason other than in accordance with the instructions from the Toyota Third Parties. Mr. West noted that a similar hose melted during \"testing\" and suggested that this could promote adhesion to tissue debris. However, Mr. West acknowledged that, given the proximity of the hose to the exhaust system, the hose would have undergone this melting within a short period of time after having been installed. There was no evidence as to when the overflow hose in the Forklift had been installed. I cannot conclude that the plastic radiator coolant overflow hose melted at the Warehouse where the Forklift had been used for less than a day and a half or that the alleged faulty installation caused or contributed to causing the Fire. No theory was presented how paper two to three feet long might have come in contact with the plastic radiator coolant overflow hose, been ignited, and then expelled from the Forklift in order that it would be streaming behind the Forklift\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "54  Mr. Lee gave evidence at Trial that the Warehouse contained metal halide lights which had been known to rupture and cause fires in other locations. I can find no facts which would allow me to conclude that such a rupture occurred and caused the Fire. There was no evidence that the lights in the Warehouse had ruptured. In particular, no witness testified that they saw a light fixture rupture or that they saw burning fragments from a ruptured bulb fall from the ceiling, either in the vicinity of the parent rolls, the Forklift or elsewhere. There is no evidence that a light failure occurred in the time leading up to the Fire. The existence of the unshielded metal halide lights at the Warehouse was addressed by a field engineer from FM Global during a May 2000 inspection. The field engineer spoke to representatives of First and advised them that turning off the lights on weekends would be a satisfactory response to the existence of the metal halide lights because, when metal halide lights are cycled on and off on a regular basis, a light which is nearing a failure point will not turn back on. The evidence of Mr. Shaw of First was that the lights were cycled on and off on a daily basis and on the weekends\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "55  I also reject the hypothesis presented on behalf of First that the Toyota Third Parties were liable for the Fire because tissue paper was drawn into the body of the Forklift as a result of the negative air pressure created by the exhaust fan and that, after coming into contact with an exposed portion of the exhaust pipe, caught fire and escaped from the body of the Forklift. I am satisfied that this theory is disproven on the evidence due primarily to the inability of paper to escape once it has entered the body of the Forklift and the inability of ignited paper to move past the radiator fan to outside of the Forklift. I accept the evidence of Jeff Colwell, a professional engineer, that paper, once inside the body of a forklift, is drawn upwards towards the radiator with significant force so that the paper cannot get past the radiator and outside the vehicle unless manually forced past the radiator. I also take into account that there was no evidence of fire damage within the body of the Forklift after the Fire. I find that it would not have been possible for paper to be drawn into the Forklift, ignited and then expelled from the Forklift\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "56  I find that any hypothesis that the Fire was caused by an alleged improperly installed coolant hose, by ruptured metal halide lights or by paper igniting once in the body of the Forklift is pure conjecture. The only conclusion that I draw from the facts is that the Fire was caused by the Forklift either running over or into the paper that then caught fire after making contact with the unwrapped exhaust system. I find that ignition of paper debris on the exposed exhaust pipe was the only cause of the Fire. This cause of the Fire is completely consistent with the observations of Mr. Nijjar. The question which then arises is whether First can be held liable for the Fire.\n",

      "\n",
      "58  First submits that the conduct of Scott was a clear acceptance of the terms contained within what was forwarded to it by First. Scott submits that the contract between the parties was partially in writing and partially oral, and that what was forwarded only existed in the form of a proposal and that there was no \"meeting of the minds\" sufficient to bind the parties to all of the terms contained in what was forwarded and that, in any event, First and Scott did not act as if what was forwarded was in force\n",

      "\n",
      "59  In the late 1990s, a decision was taken by Scott to centralize a number of its functions including warehousing and distribution. Maurice Silcock was hired as the V.P. of Logistics for Scott and was charged with securing all required warehousing space for Scott. Discussions took place between Mr. Silcock of Scott and Mr. Chicoine of First. The decision was reached that warehousing services would be provided by First in Toronto and Calgary on a \"cost plus\" basis. A Memorandum of Agreement was prepared in November of 1998 in anticipation of a more formal agreement between the parties relating to Toronto and Calgary warehousing. This Memorandum of Agreement was never signed by the parties. Despite that, the parties proceeded with the planning and implementation of warehousing operations in Toronto and Calgary\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "60  I find the financial basis of the agreement between the parties relating to the Warehouse is set out in an October 15, 1999 email between Mr. Nanji of First and Mr. Silcock of Scott. The email states in part:\n",
      "As to operating the building, we are very open as long as we have no risk and make a reasonable margin. ... The best all around option that I would suggest is that we do it the same way as Toronto on a cost plus basis with a productivity and a continuous improvement guarantee. [emphasis added\n",

      "61  By a February 14, 2000 email transmission, First informed Scott that it would provide various draft agreements for each of the three operations \"that [Scott] are waiting upon so that [the parties] may review them together\". Jordan Slatt of First was asked by Mr. Nanji of First to draft the agreements relating to the Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver warehouses. Mr. Slatt sent a copy of a template agreement to counsel for First on February 25, 2000. Counsel made some comments regarding the agreement and Mr. Slatt incorporated some of these changes in the template agreement. Mr. Chicoine of First stated at Trial that he contacted Mr. Silcock of Scott and told him that he had a draft agreement and that he wanted to discuss it. They arranged to discuss the draft after an operations meeting in the late spring of 2000\n",

Mr. Chicoine stated at Trial that they did not talk about the \"content of the agreement, but that he went through it and \"showed him what was in here\". Mr. Chicoine stated at his Examination for Discovery that it was his expectation that Mr. Silcock would eventually get back to him with affirmation that the proposed terms were acceptable or, alternatively, would raise any concerns so that the parties could then negotiate further.

      "82  The July 23, 2001 letter to Mr. Silcock of Scott dealt not only with the Calgary operation but also a proposed three-year agreement on behalf of Scott relating to the storage and distribution levels in Ontario and Quebec and a right of first refusal in favour of First for five years relating to the \"external storage and distribution needs within Canada\" of Scott. While there is a purported cancellation of the Warehouse Management Agreement, no agreement by Scott to be bound by the July 23, 2001 letter is in evidence.\n",
      "WHAT WAS THE CONTRACT\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  It is clear that the Warehouse Management Agreement and Appendix \"C\" had many deficiencies. Some of the drafting is incomprehensible. There was no Appendix \"B\". There was no paragraph 17(C). There was no indication that the changes made internally by First in January 2001 were ever communicated to Scott. Finally, Scott never executed a copy of the Warehouse Management Agreement. Despite that, I am satisfied that the draft Warehouse Management Agreement, Appendix \"A\" to the Agreement and Appendix \"C\" to the Agreement accurately reflect the contract which existed between First and Scott relating to the operations at the Warehouse and the obligations which existed between the parties\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  I find that the conduct of Scott after the Warehouse Management Agreement and what was referred to as Appendix \"C\" were forwarded amounts to an acceptance of the terms contained within the Warehouse Management Agreement. The \"financial aspects\" set out in the Warehouse Management Agreement were expressly accepted by Mr. Silcock and the parties acted in accordance with those \"financial aspects\". At no time did Scott state that any of the terms set out in the Warehouse Management Agreement were unacceptable or did not reflect the agreement between the parties. From January 2000 to the date of the Fire, First provided the services described in the Warehouse Management Agreement, including providing operating budgets and the provision of services for the handling and storage of the products of Scott. Scott paid in advance each month, First prepared a reconciliation between the amount paid and the amount owed, and there was an adjustment between the parties if Scott had overpaid or underpaid. The Warehouse Management Agreement contained terms that both parties would obtain and maintain insurance and both parties did so\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  Even though nothing was ever signed by both parties and even though Scott did not write or verbally accept the terms set out in the Warehouse Management Agreement, I find that the conduct of the parties was such as to incorporate the matters set out in the Warehouse Management Agreement. Subject only to paragraph 1 of the Agreement that the Warehouse Management Agreement would prevail over anything to the contrary in Appendix \"C\" and that no amendments or understanding modifying, amending or otherwise varying the Warehouse Management Agreement would be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties, what was set out in Appendix \"A\" and Appendix \"C\" to the Warehouse Management Agreement also form part of the contract between the parties. Accordingly, what are the provisions in the contract between the parties which affect the questions which arise in this Action?\n",
      "(a) Contractual Standard of Maintenanc\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  Appendix \"A\" to the Warehouse Management Agreement provides for \"STANDARDS FOR PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTOR - MINIMUM COMPETENCIES REQUIRED\". Appendix \"A\" required First to \"maintain the Warehouse in food grade condition and cleanliness at all times\". I find that Appendix \"A\" to the Warehouse Management Agreement forms part of the contract between the parties\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "87  Mr. Shaw was the Director of Operations at the Warehouse for First. Mr. Shaw admitted under cross-examination that the Warehouse did not meet the standard set out in Appendix \"A\":\n",
      "And food grade condition, a phrase that you used on your examination for discovery, food grade condition means super clean?\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "And this First warehouse on Derwent Place was not kept in food grade condition was it?\n",
      "It was not super clean as a result of the parent rolls, correct\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "88  Under paragraph 7(a) of the Warehouse Management Agreement, First represented that it would perform the services required under the Warehouse Management Agreement: \"... in an efficient, effective and professional manner, and properly, safely, efficiently and professionally operate and manage the Warehouse for the purposes herein described, all in accordance with the highest industry standards;\" I find that the provisions regarding cleanliness set out in Appendix \"A\" is not in conflict with the provision of cleanliness set out in paragraph 7(a) of the Warehouse Management Agreement. I am satisfied that \"food grade condition and cleanliness\" is in accordance with the \"highest industry standards\". I make this finding in the absence of expert opinion in this regard. If I am incorrect in arriving at this conclusion, then I also find that the condition in the Warehouse could not be described as being in accordance with the \"highest industry standards\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "89  In support of its defence to this Action, evidence was presented by witnesses for First regarding the housekeeping procedures which were said to be in effect: (a) First had a daily cleaning procedure in place whereby forklift truck operators were required to sweep the parent roll storage sections of the Warehouse clean at the end of the day shift; (b) Forklift truck operators were also required to sweep various areas of the Warehouse including the loading/unloading dock areas and the parent roil storage sections throughout the course of their shift where time permitted; and (c) Forklift truck operators would as necessary pick up large pieces of parent roll debris from the floor of the Warehouse\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "90  The operations in the parent roll storage areas led to considerable tissue paper debris. That debris was an obvious potential fire hazard. Mr. Klann, who was the supervisor in the Warehouse for First until early 2001, testified that employees under his supervision would sweep the Warehouse \"continuously during the day if it needed to be done\" and that he would also sweep in the Warehouse. Mr. Woykin, who succeeded Mr. Klann in that position, gave similar evidence. Mr. Shaw, their superior at First, made this acknowledgement during his cross-examination:\n",
      "And it's fair to say, sir, that if your employees had not been continually sweeping during the shift, the debris problem could very well have gotten out of hand?\n",
      "Correct\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "91  I have concluded that First was of the belief that what they had put in place was in accordance with the \"highest industry standards\". However, I find that what was actually happening in the Warehouse varied from the testimony of Messrs. Woykin, Klann and Shaw. At his Examination for Discovery, Mr. Bodnar confirmed that, once the Warehouse became full so that there were considerable parent rolls of Scott's stored at the Warehouse:\n",
      "There is quite a bit of debris around. ...\n",
      "It flakes off the rolls from the pressure of clamping it; cracks the paper; rips the paper. From driving by because these - you travel quite fast in these machines. Just from the wind going by would unravel the roll. There's many sources, reason why paper comes off. The way they come from the factory, they've only got one little piece of paper holding it closed and they can come undone, unravelled. Just basically from clamping, unclamping them. They have moved so many times.\n",
      "As the roll came unravelled not much you can do about that amount of rolls, but anything that fell on the floor, pieces of paper, you didn't want to be driving over big pieces and stuff. Nothing you can do about small, like hand-size, pieces of paper and stuff. They always continuously - generally bits of pieces we got off the machine, pick them up. Throw them in the garbage. At the end of the day we gave the warehouse a complete sweep up and down every aisle. In between the rolls almost. The warehouse floor was pretty spotless at the end of the day.\n",
      "Not much time for picking up small pieces [during the day]\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "92  Mr. Bodnar admitted that the parent roll area would not be regularly swept during the day, that he and Mr. Nijjar would stop their vehicles occasionally to remove very large pieces of debris, but that paper debris would accumulate on either side of the aisles and would pile up at the base of the stacks of parent roll. Mr. Bodnar also stated that the forklifts produced considerable exhaust which had the effect, in the words of Mr. Bodnar, of the wind going by and unravelling the rolls\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "93  In these regards, Mr. Bodnar was asked the following questions and gave the following answers at his Examination for Discovery:\n",
      "Again, just to get a sense of how significant this problem was with the accumulation of paper debris, is it the case that at virtually every row of rolls of paper that started along the aisles you would look at the bottom of rolls and see some paper debris lying at the bottom of those rolls?\n",
      "Oh, yes. That is where it would all blow from, from the forklifts driving by. It would all blow towards the sides. That was the paper that we didn't worry about because it doesn't get in your way at all; it was blown off to the side. If it was something, anything that was big enough to stay in the middle of the aisle, basically, you didn't want to be running over it and dragging it below your machine.\n",
      "But I suppose the paper debris that is getting sucked up by vacuum effect from the bottom of the lift truck, that's quite possibly paper debris that is sitting at the bottom of those rolls?\n",
      "Possibly. I never really took notice where it was coming from. There was paper debris up against the bottom of the rolls. But there was always paper debris in the middle of the aisles that hadn't been blown to the side yet. I never took notice where it was coming from.\n",
      "Again, as you have told me, it simply wasn't practical to stop your lift truck, get out, push that paper out of the way?\n",
      "No. No.\n",
      "There wasn't anyone around designated with the job of sweeping the aisles and keeping them clean?\n",
      "It would have been far too dangerous to be in that area. Right\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "94  Although it may have been the intent of the management of First to have employees continually sweeping up debris during shifts, I find that this did not occur and that the debris problem did get \"out of hand\". As well, I find that neither Mr. Nijjar nor Mr. Bodnar stopped to pick up or sweep aside the large piece of paper that caught fire. As a result of the large piece of paper catching on fire and landing at the accumulated debris at the bottom of a parent roll, the fire spread and resulted in the destruction of the product of Scott at the Warehouse. While the floor of the Warehouse may well have been \"pretty spotless at the end of the day\", it was clear that, in the words of Mr. Bodnar there was \"quite a bit of debris around\" lying at the bottom of the parent rolls. I believe that it is more than speculation to assume that the fire would not have spread as rapidly if there had not been accumulated debris at the bottom of the stack of parent rolls\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "95  In view of what was actually happening at the Warehouse, I find that First failed to maintain the Warehouse in a condition that met or exceeded professional warehousing management practices, and certainly not in what could be described as \"food grade condition and cleanliness\". Rather, First operated the Warehouse and the storage of goods in such a manner as to create excessive waste paper and paper debris during shifts at the Warehouse. It allowed excess waste paper and paper debris to accumulate during a shift, it did not allow forklift drivers to sweep up debris during shifts, it failed to warn Scott that the degree of accumulation of paper debris and the operation of the Forklift created an unreasonable risk of fire, and it failed to warn Scott that the Forklift would be operated in the Warehouse with no or insufficient safeguards to minimize the build up of paper debris and the possibility it would catch on fire.\n",
      "(b) Contractual obligations relating to the Storage of Produc\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "96  Under the Warehouse Management Agreement, First made the representation that it would manage the Warehouse \"in an efficient, effective and professional manner ... all in accordance with the highest industry standards\" (at para. 7), that it would not take any action which would cause or contribute to \"undue or accelerated damage of such goods and products\" (at para. 7(ii)), and would \"properly and safely maintain, and keep in sanitary, neat and orderly condition, all goods and products (at para. 7(iv)). Under Appendix \"A\" of the Warehouse Management Agreement, First agreed to \"strive to keep product loss [of product under the control of First] to a minimum, whether due to inventory shrinkage, damage or any other reason\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "97  First was aware of the smouldering problem, and took steps to deal with the overheating of the engine of the Original Forklift. At his June 1, 2005 Examination for Discovery, Paul Klann, the former manager for First at the Warehouse was asked the following questions and gave the following answers:\n",
      " Q  Were you also aware that Mr. Bodnar could smell paper smouldering inside his lift truck; within the body of his lift truck? \n",
      " A Yes, I was. \n",
      " Q  So in addition to the overheating you were aware that one of the consequences of this accumulation of paper debris was that paper could have been heating and smouldering due to contact with hot metal surfaces within the lift truck? \n",
      " A That's correct. \n",
      " Q Was that a concern of yours as well? \n",
      " A Yes, it was. \n",
      " Q  Was that a concern of Mr. Bodnar's, as far as you could appreciate? \n",
      " A Yes, it was. \n",
      " Q  Was that one of the factors that led you to deciding to contact Mason Life and ask them for assistance? \n",
      " A  Yes. ... What I recall is them sending somebody to the location and looking inside the machine and finding an area that would have created the heat. ... After what I believe was some trial and error we found it to be the pipe, the exhaust pipe of the machine itself. \n",
      " Q  After Mason Lift came to your warehouse and wrapped the exhaust pipes did that remedy or ameliorate the overheating problem with the lift trucks to any extent? \n",
      " A I don't believe it remedied the overheating. \n",
      " Q Did it remedy the smouldering problems? \n",
      " A Yes. \n",
      " Q  Why do you say that? What recollection do you have of that being the case? \n",
      " A  They had tried a couple of things in the past and the moment it didn't work I called Mason Lift again to bring a mechanic in and the last wrapping the pipe after that point there were no more smouldering issues and basically we thought we had it fixed. \n",
      " Q  Is what you're telling me you were told by Terrence Bodnar after the exhaust pipe was wrapped the smouldering has gone away, so that's how you know it solved the smouldering problem? \n",
      " A  I know it solved the smouldering one. I never saw any smouldering since that point.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "98  First knew of the hazard presented by the storage of unwrapped parent rolls of tissue paper. Mr. Shaw was asked whether the unwrapped rolls created a debris or housekeeping problem for the operations of First and he answered: \"Yes, they did\". Mr. Shaw admitted at Trial that First was aware of the flammability of the paper debris:\n",
      "And you understood, Mr. Shaw, that Scott was looking to First to store its inventory safely?\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "You knew, Mr. Shaw, or at least you came to understand from your, over the course of your first months in the warehouse, you knew tissue paper is a very flammable substance?\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "You knew that it is easily ignited?\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "And you knew how important it was to avoid exposing Scott inventory in your warehouse to the risk of catching fire?\n",
      "Correct\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "99  Mr. Bodnar and therefore First was well aware of the problem of paper coming into contact with the exhaust system of the Original Forklift. In this regard, Mr. Bodnar was asked the following questions and gave the following answers at his Examination for Discovery:\n",
      "Your understanding prior to July 31st, 2001 was that the temperature of the exhaust system on the lift truck was hot enough - I'm talking about the surface of the exhaust pipes ... of the exhaust manifold was hot enough to ignite tissue paper?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Was that something that you had observed or discussed before or was that just an assumption you made?\n",
      "We hadn't discussed it. I observed it. Yes.\n",
      "Where did you observe it? In what circumstances?\n",
      "Operating the machine. It overheated. The temperature - there wasn't air coming out at the bottom but the temperature was really high on it and I smelt something smouldering, smoke. The first time I ever smelt it that's when I stopped, turned the machine off, opened the bonnet and the paper under there - it wasn't really on fire; it was smouldering. It was turning brown kind of.\n",
      "Where was this paper located that was turning brown?\n",
      "That is the part I have difficulty with, is where the exhaust - I can see part of the exhaust between the engine compartment and the radiator and there was a piece of paper like touching, but I think it was part of the exhaust.\n",
      "Around the muffler? That far back?\n",
      "Yes. Yes.\n",
      "That is on the opposite side of the radiator in the shaker screen, is it?\n",
      "It wasn't the muffler; it was the exhaust pipe. If I remember - like you're saying the muffler was on the opposite side of the - toward the back of the machine. I can't recall what it looks like now.\n",
      "But was it your experience that paper debris could get sucked up and get sucked through the shaker screen and the radiator into that back area where the tail pipe and the muffler were located?\n",
      "It has to come up past the exhaust pipe first to get to the shaker screen and the radiator. And being such a suction I guess since it's happened earlier, no paper had ever gotten stuck by the exhaust pipe, it all went to the shaker screen. The radiator blocked the flow of the air and the machine overheated. It's only a matter of time before it starts - you know, before it got near the exhaust. Sooner or later it was bound to happen, which it did. That's when I opened the bottom and it's smouldering and there was a brown piece of paper there.\n",
      "And this incident happened when? How long before the July 31st fire?\n",
      "I can't remember. Quite a few months before. I'm not sure.\n",
      "You have a clear recollection, though, that it really - \"hey, this is a problem; a fire could start\"?\n",
      "Not really then. It was a concern. I mean - like because I had been operating the machine quite a bit, it had overheating problems, so this was just one time - it's like a little bit of paper got stuck near the exhaust. So it wasn't a big concern. I had brought it up with my supervisor and that was noted. And we just kept the machine clean, back to work. If it overheated we stopped again and did the same routine.\n",
      "So before the wrap was installed how many times a day on average were you stopping the forklift because of the smell of smouldering paper? Would it happen every day?\n",
      "Smouldering of paper, no. There was a toss-up between overheating and smouldering of paper. There was always an issue every day if it wasn't overheating then there was smouldering. Sometimes it could overheat four days in a week, one day, a bit of a smouldering smell. Or it could smoulder two or three days in week and overheat the rest or both together\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "100  Mr. Bodnar and therefore First was well aware of the fire risk created by paper debris accumulating in the engine compartment of the Original Forklift as well as the smouldering of papers due to the high temperature of the exhaust system:\n",
      "Tell me about that, about getting the exhaust pipes on the forklift wrapped. How did that come about?\n",
      "Well, after how many times we had these issues about smouldering paper we thought this could get out of hand if we're not careful. We had a mechanic come in one day. Not for that issue; he was there and somehow the issue came up: Well, you can wrap these pipes with this special material, asbestos. I'm not sure who looked into that; whether it was my supervisor, my manager. And a little while later a mechanic came back had wrapped the pipes for us. Didn't take him very long.\n",
      "You started off by saying \"we thought this could get out of hand.\" You're referring to the smouldering of the paper?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "When you said \"we\" again do you mean you individually or is this something you had been discussing with other people at First?\n",
      "With my supervisor, Dan [Woykin] or Paul [Klann]. Yes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "101  Mr. Shaw testified regarding the steps taken by First to address fire risks. Mr. Shaw agreed that he was \"hypersensitive\" to these risks. Mr. Shaw acknowledged that he regarded these smouldering incidents in the Original Forklift as a serious problem:\n",
      "And then, Mr. Shaw, after that propane lift truck went into operation, you began hearing of the lift truck drivers experiencing what we've been calling thermal events, including smouldering of paper debris; correct?\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "You regarded this smouldering as a serious problem?\n",
      "Yes\n",

      "102  Under the contract between the parties, First was obligated to perform in and \"effective and professional manner ... while in accordance with the highest industry standards\" and was obligated to properly and safely maintain all goods and products of Scott. First addressed the smouldering and fire risk by having the exhaust pipe of the Original Forklift wrapped. First also purchased an air compressor so that the lift truck operators could use it to \"blow down\" their lift trucks to rid the engine compartment of paper that had been sucked up onto the shaker screen of the radiator\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "103  I find that First was in breach of the contract between the parties when it failed to wrap the exhaust of the Forklift. By failing to do so, First did not perform its services in an \"efficient, effective and professional manner\", did not operate and manage the Warehouse \"in accordance with the highest industry standards\", failed to wrap the exhaust of the Forklift so as to not \"cause or contribute to undue or accelerated damage\" of the goods stored by Scott at the Warehouse and failed to keep the Forklift \"in good working order at all times\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "104  The damages incurred by Scott flow from the breaches of the contract by First when it failed to maintain the Warehouse in food-grade condition and cleanliness at all times and when it failed to maintain and protect the product of Scott in accordance with the highest industry standards. The question which then arises is whether First also failed to meet the duty of care that it owned to Scott.\n",
      "WHAT DUTY OF CARE WAS OWED BY FIRST\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "105  To establish a claim for negligence, Scott must satisfy the onus of showing that First owed it a duty of care, that First breached that duty of care, and that damages resulted from the breach. I find that, at common law and pursuant to the provisions of the Warehouse Receipt Act, First owed Scott a duty of care. The question which arises is whether First breached the relevant standard of care, whether any breaches caused the Fire, and whether any breaches resulted in damages being suffered by Scott\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "106  The burden is on Scott to demonstrate that the practices of First fell short of the general industry practice. The Defendants assert that the applicable standard of care should be based on the standard practice of the industry, being the warehousing and handling of paper products. Because the Defendants produced no independent or reliable evidence with respect to the appropriate standard of care and because I am not in a position to conclude that the care can be anything less than what is set out in s. 2(4) of the Warehouse Receipt Act (\"... that care and diligence in regard to the goods as a careful and vigilant owner of similar goods would exercise in the custody of them in similar circumstances\"), I am satisfied that the duty of care is as a \"careful and vigilant owner\". In this regard, s. 2(4)(a) provides that any warehouse receipt cannot contain a term or condition that is \"contrary to any provision of this Act ...\". Accordingly, any attempt in the contract between the parties to reduce the care and diligence that had to be shown by First as a \"careful and vigilant owner\" cannot prevail\n",

Hanke, , where the Chief Justice on behalf of the Court stated that the \"but for\" test requires the Plaintiff to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the damage would not have occurred but for the negligence of the Defendant, and that there must be substantial connection between the acts of the defendants and causation of the damage\n",

Accordingly, I am satisfied that, if the standard of care set out in the Warehouse Receipt Act is not found to be the care exercised by First, the lesser standard imposed under the Occupier's Liability Act is not met as well\n",

      "\"It would be very dangerous doctrine, for which there is not a vestige of authority, to hold that a depositor of goods for safe custody, who, by himself or his servants, had had an opportunity of observing certain defects in the storehouse, must be taken to have agreed that any risk of injury to his goods which might possibly be occasioned by these defects should be borne by him, and not by his paid bailee.

Applying this to a case like the present, where for the period of the working hours the ordinary conditions of a complete bailment in fact prevail, and the bailee's servants are in charge and know all about it, but during the rest of the 24 hours the bailor's servants are in charge and know all about it, it would seem to follow that the onus of proof cast upon the bailee only applies to damage originating during the period of working hours. It seems to me impossible to throw upon a bailee the onus of accounting for injury happening while he and his servants are away and the bailor is there: and at the same time unreasonable to alter the rule if the injury happens while the bailee or his servants are there and in charge, even though some of the bailor's servants may be there as a term of the bailment\n",

A careful and vigilant owner would and should have foreseen that there was a risk of fire igniting due to smouldering paper debris coming into contact with various parts of a propane lift truck and if the Warehouse was not kept in a \"food-grade condition\" so that paper debris was allowed to accumulate at the base of the stored parent rolls during each shift. A careful and vigilant warehouseman in the position of First would have taken steps to sweep up the paper debris not only in the aisles but also at the base of the stacked parent rolls on a regular basis and not just after each shift. I find that these failures amount to a breach of the duties owed by First to Scott. I am satisfied that Scott has demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that the damage which occurred would not have occurred but for the negligence of First in this regard. First has not shown that the duty that it owed to Scott has been discharged. As the standard of care if higher than merely not acting negligently, First has not met the onus of showing that the duty imposed upon it has been discharged.

      "119  In this case, the elimination of much of the risk posed by the unwrapped exhaust would have been a simple matter - all that would have been required was an instruction to Mason at the time the \"replacement\" unit was ordered; or, failing that, a request to Mason to have a mechanic attend and wrap the exhaust pipes once the Forklift had been delivered. This step would not have been complicated. As noted during the examination in chief of Mr. Larsen of Mason, the wrapping process would have taken less than two hours. A careful and vigilant warehouseman in the position of First would have undertaken the wrapping of the exhaust pipes before the Forklift was used in the Warehouse.

Second, there is no evidence that Scott was ever advised that the amount of debris generated by its own operations would have made it desirable to wrap or shield the exhaust systems of the lift trucks it was using in order to protect its product from fire at locations other than the Warehouse. Third, the experience of Scott with smouldering and fire stands in distinct contrast to the experience of First.

I also find there was no duty to warn Scott as a renter of equipment from Mason or as a party who had knowledge that First was renting Toyota equipment from Mason. I find that the knowledge of First that the exhaust system would have to be wrapped, shielded or otherwise protected to safeguard against the risk of fire and the decision to proceed to use the Forklift in spite of the known danger, breaks the chain of causation between the alleged negligent failure to warn and the loss\n",

It is submitted by First that Scott had knowledge of the following: (a) that unwrapped parent rolls created debris by sloughing and unwrapping which was unavoidable and ordinary in the handling of parent rolls with clamp roll trucks; (b) debris created from the parent rolls would get into lift trucks as a result of the vacuum suction created by the operation of the lift trucks; and (c) debris in lift trucks could smoulder and potentially ignite from a number of hot structures within the vehicle\n",

Scott did wrap its parent rolls destined for sale and \"export\" to other converters.

      "146  Scott made the decision that \"local\" parent rolls would not be wrapped. Once that decision was made, it was incumbent upon First to sweep the floors with sufficient frequency that debris would not accumulate. The contractual obligation on First was to see a cleaning of the Warehouse in accordance with the highest industry standards and in food grade condition and cleanliness \"at all times\". That contractual obligation was not to be in effect only at the end of each shift. While there would have been pressure on First to reduce its costs, the contractual relationship between the parties was that First was working on a cost plus basis so that any additional cost to sweep the floors would have been a cost that would have been passed on to Scott\n",

      "149  I have reached a similar conclusion regarding the submission of the Defendants relating to the stacking height of parent rolls. Before the Warehouse was occupied, FM Global as the property insurer of Scott analyzed the sprinkler system of the Warehouse and recommended a maximum storage height of 15 feet for parent rolls. What was recommended was described as follows: \"for best protection, the following storage limitation should be implemented\" and that the storage height of unwrapped parent rolls on end \"should be kept to a maximum height of 15 ft for Zones 5 and 6\". It is further noted:\n",
      "For storage scenarios different than described above some sprinkler systems will need to be reinforced/redesigned. It is therefore very important that these guidelines be followed to ensure that you are adequately protected\n",

These recommendations were followed for a short time but I find that instructions were later received from Scott to return to the former storage heights so that the 60-inch parent rolls would be stored four high so 20 feet in height and the 90-inch parent rolls would be stored three high so 22-1/2 feet in height\n",

While Scott would naturally wish to keep expenses to a minimum, I cannot conclude that it controlled the operations of the Warehouse.

To the extent that what is set out in Appendix \"C\" conflicts with what is in the Warehouse Management Agreement, the provisions of the Warehouse Management Agreement prevail.

      "175  The evidence of Mr. Lebel was that this \"Delfour Receipt\" was a standardized pre-printed form which was generated by the software used by First. It was the testimony of Mr. Shaw of First that, if anyone from Scott had asked to see the \"original warehouse receipt\" referred to in the document stamp on the bill of lading, the Delfour Receipt is the document they would have been given. This is further evidence that Appendix \"C\" was not dealt with by First as the warehouse receipt. The accounting employees of Scott were given the front page of the Delfour Receipt as part of the process of reconciling the inventory that was in the Warehouse. Scott was not provided with the part of the form that included the terms printed on the reverse side, which included this attempted limitation of liability:\n",

      "180  Fourth, it can hardly be said that liability could be limited under the Delfour Receipt even though the evidence allows me to find that Scott was never provided with copies of the reverse side of the Delfour Receipt. At Trial in this regard, Mr. Shaw confirmed that each bill of lading received from Scott \"would be treated as an individual receipt and then once they got entered into our system, the warehouse receipt would be printed off when you confirmed it\". Paper copies of the documents were then kept at the Warehouse but would have been lost during the Fire. On re-examination, Mr. Scott was asked the following questions and gave the following answers:\n",

      "181  I am satisfied that the intent of the parties to provide for full indemnification as set out in paragraph 12 of the Warehouse Management Agreement is reinforced by the requirement in paragraph 17D of the Warehouse Management Agreement which required First to obtain and maintain \"industry standard Warehouseman's Legal Liability Insurance\" covering all risk of loss of inventory and property belonging to Scott with the proviso that the \"Damaged or lost inventory and products\" insured under that policy would be valued at the \"selling price to the trade\" of Scott.

The British Columbia Court of Appeal held that the clause did not impair the obligation of the warehouseman to exercise the standard of care required by the statute. Regarding the obligation to take care, McIntyre J. stated:\n",
      "... the parties to a storage contract coming within the provisions of the Warehouse Receipts Act may not by private contract stipulate for some other and possibly lower standard of care thereby relieving the warehouseman of his statutory duty. I agree with the approach of McFarlane J.A. in the Court of Appeal when he said:\n",
      "I look at the language of the statute itself, and I point out that it does not speak of impairing the liability or responsibility to pay damages for the failure to exercise care and diligence. It speaks of impairing the obligation to exercise care and the degree of care is set out in the statute. In my opinion, what this statute says is that a provision which impairs the obligation may not be included in a receipt. Now it is said that a clause limiting liability for breach may be such that it would incline the warehouseman to act carelessly and not take the care required by the statute with respect to the goods. It is said it follows from that that the obligation is thereby impaired. I do not agree. I think the impairment spoken of here is an impairment of the degree and nature of the care and diligence referred to in the section, and I am firmly of the opinion that a clause limiting the liability of a warehouseman to fifty dollars per package in the case of this plywood is not one which impairs that obligation.\n",

With respect to finished goods, there is no agreement. Scott submits that a unit is a case of finished goods. First submits that a unit is a \"lift\" or pallet: the assembly of stacked cases of finished goods shipped to the Warehouse.

Subsequent correspondence continuously discussed the number of cases. There is no evidence of any written or oral discussion in which lifts or pallets were utilized as a unit of measure. Scott and First agreed to measure the productivity of the work within the Warehouse through \"Key Performance Indicators\". Many of these Indicators were based on \"per case\" units of measurement.

The evidence of Mr. Lavik of First was to the same effect\n",

      "\n",
      "190  The unit of measure utilized by the parties in their daily operations was cases. The Bills of Lading prepared for shipments of product from Scott to the Warehouse signified the number of cases. As acknowledged by Mr. Woykin of First, once the shipments of cases had been received from Scott, First would fax back a stamped acknowledgment of the number of \"pieces\". The number of \"pieces\" corresponded to the number of cases set out in the Bills of Lading.

Filling these orders was one of the responsibilities of First. If a customer ordered a number of cases that did not correspond with a number of cases of that product on a lift, Warehouse employees would \"break\" apart a lift to make up the order.

Scott will maintain general liability insurance, tenant's legal liability insurance, and insurance of its inventory and property within the warehouse.\n",

      "If the comprehensive general liability policy contains a general aggregate, that aggregate limit shall apply separately, per location, so that the Warehouse will have its own aggregate limit. All insurance policies contemplated hereunder shall constitute and respond as primary coverage to any insurance otherwise available Scott and any of its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, servants and agents, its affiliated, related, parent and subsidiary companies, or its and their appointees, successors and assigns.\n",
      "All insurance must be with a licensed insurance company. The Contractor and Scott will provide one another with a copy of the insurance policy or policies and certificates of insurance, upon requests, which must evidence that the Contractor has procured the insurance required hereunder at the minimum limits specified in this Agreement.\n",

      "Scott shall, at its own cost and expense, insure and keep insured any of its own property in, on or about the Warehouse, in which Scott itself has an insurable interest, including, without limitation, Scott'[s] inventory, furniture, fixtures; and equipment.\n",

      "The Contractor shall obtain and maintain industry standard Warehouseman's Legal Liability Insurance that covers against risk of loss of inventory and property belonging to Scott or its divisions, subsidiaries, affiliated or related corporations, and arising from or relating to the Contractor's gross negligence, which insurance shall be in the amount of (Cdn.) five million dollars. Damaged or lost inventory and products insured hereunder will be valued at Scott'[s] selling price to the trade.\n",

      "\n",
      "196  Instead, the question raised by First is said to arise as a result of the provisions in the Warehouse Management Agreement which impose upon First and Scott obligations to arrange for insurance\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "197  First submits that the paragraph 17 insurance provisions of the Warehouse Management Agreement provide a complete bar to the claims advanced by Scott against First. First relies on the following Supreme Court of Canada decisions in this regard: Agnew-Surpass Shoe Stores Limited v. Cummer-Yonge Investments Ltd., ; Ross Southward Tire Ltd. v. Pyrotech Products Ltd.,  [Pyrotech]; and T. Eaton Company v. Smith, . This \"trilogy\" of cases dealt with the impact of insurance covenants in lease agreements\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "198  Agnew-Surpass was decided on the basis that the provisions of the particular lease taken as a whole led to the conclusion that the landlord's covenant to keep the premises insured ran to the benefit of the tenant so that any subrogated claim of the landlord's insurer against the tenant failed, notwithstanding that the tenant's negligence was the cause of the loss\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "199  In Pyrotech, the tenant had paid the premiums for the fire insurance coverage of the landlord and Laskin C.J. writing for the majority stated that the insurer of the landlord was barred from proceeding against the tenant:\n",
      "Counsel for the appellant did not urge (indeed, he stated that it was not necessary to his position), that the landlord was in breach of a covenant to insure and that the covenant should have embraced risk of loss by fire resulting from the tenant's negligence. Rather, it was his contention that under the provision of the lease respecting payment of insurance rates by the tenant, the risk of loss by fire passed to the landlord, at least upon the presentation by the landlord of the insurance bill, and that the matter thereafter was between the landlord and its insurer. I agree with this contention ... (p. 39).\n",
      "Counsel for the respondent contended that there was no exculpatory provision in the lease to relieve the tenant of liability for negligence nor could any such term be implied. Such a view is too sweeping in ignoring the effect of the provision as to payment of insurance rates. The tenant may well be liable to answer for negligence in other respects but, in my opinion, it is entitled to rest in respect of loss by fire on the discharge of its obligation to pay for fire insurance (p. 40)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "200  The decision in T. Eaton Company, supra, also concerned the covenant of the landlord to insure with the insurance premiums being paid by the tenant. For the majority, Laskin C.J. stated:\n",
      "... The simple question before this Court is whether [the subrogating insurers] are precluded by the terms of the two Leases from succeeding in their claim, having regard to the fact that the landlords had each covenanted in the Leases to insure the premises against fire .... (at p. 752)\n",
      ".... If [the tenant] can escape this liability in the present case, it can only be on the basis that the landlord's covenant to insure is a covenant that runs to the benefit of the tenant, lifting from it the risk of liability for fire arising from its negligence and bringing that risk under insurance coverage.\n",
      "Had the landlord insured without giving a covenant to that effect in the Lease, the tenant's risk of liability for fire resulting from negligence would be unquestionable; and if the landlord collected from his insurer, the latter would have an equally unquestionable right of recovery from the tenant in a subrogated action. (at p. 754\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "201  These cases are generally recognized as standing for the proposition that, in the context of a commercial lease, a covenant to insure by a landlord should flow to the benefit of a tenant unless that result would be inconsistent with something in the lease itself: North Newton Warehouses Ltd. v. The Alliance Woodcraft Manufacturing Inc.  (C.A.) at para. 33. This principle has also been extended to construction contracts: Madison Developments Ltd. v. Plan Electric Co.  (C.A.)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "202  Scott takes the position that First did not pay the property insurance costs of Scott so that the decision in Pyrotech has no bearing on the questions which are before the Court. Scott submits that these cases are of no assistance to the Defendants because: (a) there is no language in the Warehouse Management Agreement which suggests an intent that the property insurance policy of Scott should benefit First; (b) there is a valid commercial reason for the parties to a warehousing agreement to stipulate that it is incumbent upon the bailor to insure its property against loss; (c) there is a critical distinction between leases and construction contracts on the one hand and contracts of bailment on the other hand regarding the insurable interest of the parties in the bailed property; and (d) barring a claim against a bailee in respect of losses arising from a breach of its duty of care because of an insurance provision would effectively extinguish the rights of a bailor in entirety and such an interpretation of an insurance clause would contravene the common law obligations of a warehouseman and would make meaningless the requirement that First act as a careful and vigilant owner\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "203  Clauses in contractual relationship between bailors and bailees which stipulate that the bailee is not an insurer of the goods of the bailor and that the obligation to obtain insurance rests with the bailor are commonly found. I am satisfied that such clauses are simply a means of stipulating that the warehouser does not accept the risk of loss to goods which may arise other than as a result of its own fault. In Rose v. Borisko Brothers Ltd. , aff'd , the warehouse receipts provided that the goods were stored at the bailor's risk in case of fire and that the storage rates did not include insurance. On a review of authorities, including Pyrotech and T. Eaton Co., O'Brien J. concluded:\n",
      "I am satisfied, on the basis of the cases to which I have been referred, that before an insurance policy will bar subrogation there must exist some special relationship between the insurer and the person against whom subrogation is sought. In general terms, the cases stand for the proposition that an insurer cannot assert against a third party any rights which the insured has by contract put beyond his own reach. In this case, I find neither any special relationship that should preclude subrogation nor any contractual terms that would prevent subrogation in this case.\n",
      "(at p. 691\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "204  This conclusion was affirmed by the Court of Appeal:\n",
      "Further, we agree with the trial judge that there was in this neither any special relationship between the parties nor any contractual term that would prevent or restrict the insurer's right of subrogation.\n",
      "(at p. 606\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "205  I am satisfied that the landlord-tenant and construction project cases that have found a bar to subrogation can be distinguished from cases involving bailor and bailee. A warehouser does not have a generalized property interest in the goods which it stores. On the other hand, tenants have an insurable interest in the continuing existence and availability for use of demised premises. Similarly, the insurable interest of all trades and subtrades in a construction project is obvious and was recognized in Commonwealth Construction Co. v. Imperial Oil Ltd., \n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "206  The right to claim under an insurance policy can only exist where the claimant has an insurable interest. First does not have an insurable interest in the goods of Scott. Instead, First had a lien on the goods and that is the extent of its interest. First expressly disclaimed all right, interest and title in the goods stored by Scott, but excepted from this disclaimer its rights under the statutory lien which was available to it\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "207  If adopted, I am satisfied that the submission of First would result in an impairment of the duty of care owed by First to Scott. There appears to be no Canadian decisions dealing with the question of the submission that First makes. In this regard, Scott relies on two United States decisions dealing with the interplay between the statutory duty of care and insurance provisions. The decisions confirm that no subrogation bar arises where the loss has occurred due to the fault of the warehouser. I adopt the following decisions and the conclusions that are reached in them\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "208  In Brown v. Sloan's Moving & Storage Company, 296 SW2d 20 (S.C.Mo., 1956), the warehouse receipt provided that the bailor \"... assumes responsibility ... for ... fire .... The depositor must carry own insurance against fire and other losses or damage to property stored.\" The Court held: \"It would seem that the provision in the storage order and warehouse receipt, insofar as the provision is construed as relieving the warehouseman-defendant from the exercise of the prescribed degree of care is invalid. The warehouseman may not avoid liability for his negligence.\" (at p. 25)\n",

Lake Erie Warehouse, Division of Lake Erie Rolling Mill Inc., 375 NYS (2d) 918, 49 A2d 492, the warehouser's \"Rate Schedule Agreement\" provided that the warehouser would be exempt from liability when the bailor had secured insurance, and where the bailor had obtained a policy of all risks insurance. The New York State Supreme Court Appellate Division, overturning the trial judge, and held that the contract's exculpatory provisions were ineffective under the Uniform Commercial Code\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "210  In addition to having the potential effect of impairing the duty of care owed by First to Scott, I am also satisfied that acceding to the submission made by First would make meaningless the indemnification contained in the Warehouse Management Agreement. Any such acceptance of the position advanced by First would have to be in very specific language. That specific language cannot be found in the Warehouse Management Agreement. Accordingly, I am satisfied that there is no bar to subrogation.\n",

      "1  The plaintiff, Jason Sean Nadeau, was injured on July 1, 2005, when he was struck by a motor vehicle. He was attending a music concert at an outdoor venue called The Bluffs. The Bluffs are located on an Indian Reserve on the west side of Lake Okanagan, directly across the lake from the City of Kelowna. This trial deals only with the issue of liability with regard to the parties who are represented and participated in the trial. Counsel have agreed that the issue of damages, if there is liability, can be dealt with by a judge other than myself\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "2  There are a number of other defendants who did not appear and were not represented at the trial. No claims were pursued at the trial with regard to those defendants. Plaintiff's counsel, at the opening of the trial, advised that service had been effected in some cases by substitutional service against the other defendants. He advised that he would be seeking judgment against those defendants at the end of the trial. I advised him that he could consider applying to the registrar for default judgment if he felt it was appropriate and after considering the consequences of doing so. I advised him that if he were seeking judgment after the trial, that would have to be based on the evidence which was led at the trial, including, if any, evidence of negligence. Ultimately, no applications were made with regard to any of the defendants or parties not represented at this trial\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "3  One of those parties, John Karroll, was called as a witness. He was not represented by counsel. I asked plaintiff's counsel whether any claims were being made or pursued against Mr. Karroll or his business, Skyz the Limit, or Swak Management Inc., his employer. I was concerned that if claims were being pursued against Mr. Karroll or these companies that he be aware of that so he could consider whether he required the assistance of counsel. Plaintiff's counsel advised me that they did not believe they were pursuing any claims against these parties. In defence of counsel's uncertainty on this issue, I should point out that he was required to take over the file on short notice when the counsel who was scheduled to take the trial found he had a scheduling conflict. The large number of defendants is a result of counsel's caution in naming all of the potential defendants who may have contributed to the plaintiff's injuries in order to avoid potential limitation problems. The claims against those parties who were not in attendance at the trial were not pursued during the trial, nor was evidence led with regard to those claims, nor were arguments made with regard to any of those potential claims\n",

      "4  Counsel who were present were prepared to proceed and, given the length of time that has passed since the accident occurred, it is understandable they would want some resolution with regard to the issue of liability of the parties who were represented at the trial. Despite concerns I have about proceeding in this fashion, including the potential splitting of a trial, I felt it was appropriate to do so given the great deal of time which has passed since the accident. I was also advised by plaintiff's counsel that any of the other defendants may be judgment-proof in any event. However, proceeding in this fashion is not something I would recommend. This may lead to complications in determining liability if any of these other defendants are in fact pursued to judgment\n",

The statement of defence denies that the plaintiff was involved in an accident at all, although that is not in issue at trial. The statement of defence also alleged that the plaintiff failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain the identity or ownership of the vehicle. However, I was advised at trial that was not an issue or defence being pursued. The statement of defence denies that the accident occurred on a highway and, therefore, argues that the provisions under s. 24(1) of the Act dealing with uninsured drivers do not apply. The defence also refers to the Negligence Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 333 and alleges contributory negligence against the plaintiff\n",

Access to The Bluffs is from a public road onto a dirt road that leads to an entrance with four ticket wickets. People drive their cars through this entrance and into a large field which is used as a parking lot. There is a long fence which separates this parking area from the area surrounding the stage. This fence has two entrances - one described as the main entrance. Concert goers park their cars and then walk through this main entrance. Ahead of them and to their right, away from the stage, was a beer garden. To their left were concession tents that ran along the fence. Ahead of them was a large field which faced the front of the stage. This large field was the viewing area\n",

      "13  A supplementary dirt road also led from the area of the four ticket wickets off to the left and then to the northeast end of the fence which separated the general parking area from the concert area. There was a gate at that location, but no physical barrier; this was referred to as the secondary gate. This gate opened up to an area to the side and back of the stage. Inside this area was a fence which extended from the side of the stage and then back again towards the east enclosing an area behind the stage. There was a physical gate which was controlled by security guards that allowed entry to this area behind the stage. The area behind the stage has been referred to as the \"VIP area\". There were some motorhomes in that area which were used by the performers, as well as a good deal of equipment that would be used by the performers. Access to this VIP area was strictly controlled. The area between the secondary gate and the VIP parking area was open and there was no barrier which prevented passage from the area generally used by the concert goers to view the stage and this area. Parking was allowed in this area, and it was referred to as the secondary parking area during the trial. This was also referred to as the \"overflow parking area\"\n",

      "15  Mr. Nadeau accompanied two friends who were performing at a music concert scheduled for the weekend. They attended on June 30, a Thursday. They parked in this secondary parking area. Two of them had to return to their home to make some changes to their program and, when they returned, they bypassed the line of traffic after the wickets and came to the main gate. They were allowed to drive through the main gate, past the concession stands and back down to the secondary parking area. This was not the normal way to access the secondary parking area. Normally access to the secondary parking area would be through the secondary gate\n",

There was some opportunity for Mr. Jong and members of his performance group to perform again on July 1, although they did not do so. They did, however, stay into the evening. This time they came through the secondary gate and parked in the same secondary parking area. The event was not as busy as it was the day before. There were a number of vehicles parked in the secondary parking area\n",

She had called him from Vancouver and was upset that he had not gone to Vancouver with her, but rather chose to attend the concert with his friends. Mr. Nadeau was trying to make amends for not being in Vancouver. The call lasted approximately one half hour. He was in the secondary parking area where vehicles did come and go. Sometimes he was standing and sometimes he was squatting. He was facing east, away from the area occupied by the main concert goers and the concession tents, and looking towards the lake which backed the venue. There was some ambient light, but this particular area was not lit\n",

He saw a light reflecting on some leaves along the fence between himself and the lake. The light was coming from behind him. He turned and saw a vehicle which he said was some distance away. He thought it was unusual for a vehicle to be coming from that direction which was in the area of the concession tents. He assumed he was clearly visible and that the driver would see him, or that some of the security people on site would deal with the vehicle. He turned away again, looking back to the east. He again looked over his left shoulder just as the vehicle struck him and he was run over by the vehicle. He was rolled or dragged under the vehicle until it stopped. He is not sure what distance that may have been\n",

      "19  When the vehicle stopped, he was still under the vehicle and between the front and rear passenger side wheels. His head, and probably his shoulders, were partially out from under the vehicle, but the rest of his body was extended under the vehicle towards the driver side. Someone in the rear passenger side of the vehicle got out, looked at him, and said words to the effect that they had hit somebody and they needed to get out of there. The person jumped back into the vehicle and it proceeded to drive over Mr. Nadeau's chest with the rear passenger wheels. He was shocked when the person jumped back into the vehicle and he realized they were going to drive over him. He attempted to flex his chest muscles, but said he could feel or hear his ribs breaking as the truck drove over him. Despite his injuries, which included some fractured ribs and a broken pelvis, he attempted to stand up to chase the vehicle. Mr. Nadeau was subsequently taken by ambulance to the Kelowna General Hospital to be treated for his injuries. He remained in hospital for almost a month. He was in a significant amount of pain and heavily medicated for at least part of the time he was in the hospital. It appeared, while he was in court and either observing the trial or giving his evidence, that he continues to suffer a good deal of discomfort. I am not dealing with the issue of damages, but it would appear that he has a significant claim. He was approximately 31 years of age at the time of the accident and has not been working since the accident.\n",

He did get a chance to notice the colour of the vehicle when the passenger's door was open close to his head. The interior light illuminated the inside of the door and he could tell that it was black or dark in colour. He did have an opportunity to observe the passenger who stepped out of the vehicle and was able to note that the person was a black person. He could see that the vehicle had what he described as \"Nerf Bars\" or a form of tubular running boards along the side of the vehicle. He noted the Nerf Bars were silver in colour. He also noted that the tires were a \"beefy\" tire or had course treads. When the vehicle passed over him the second time and then left the scene, he was able to see the back of the vehicle and could tell that it was an SUV-type vehicle\n",

He gave this license plate number to Mr. Nadeau, who was in the hospital at the time. He wrote it on a card and left it for him to give to the police\n",

      "27  At the scene, his friend, Mr. Jong, attended immediately after the accident and heard Mr. Nadeau say that it was a black SUV and made some comment about black people. Mr. Nadeau could not recall speaking to the ambulance attendants or the medical personnel in the days immediately following the accident. There were records filed, being the crew report from the ambulance, which does not add much. There was also an admission history and physical report from the Kelowna General Hospital dictated July 2, 2005. This simply describes the injuries and some social background, as well as the results of some laboratory tests\n",

      "29  Sean Wylie, a retired member of the RCMP, but Staff Sergeant on July 5, 2005, was also in attendance at the accident immediately after it occurred. Mr. Nadeau told him that he had been run over, perhaps by a dark coloured Escalade. He made a note to that effect, but he did not recall the exact conversation. In his handwritten notes he noted a dark coloured SUV - maybe an Escalade\n",

It is not clear where this information came from, although it may have come from Mr. Nadeau. It does not add much to the evidence about which vehicle struck Mr. Nadeau\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  There was a further consultation report dated July 4, 2005 by Dr. Schuster. Mr. Nadeau does not recall meeting with Dr. Schuster, but it is reasonable to assume that the clinical history came from Mr. Nadeau. He described being run over by an SUV and he \"... recalls everything about the accident except the license plate of the vehicle.\n",

      "32  Mr. Andrew Burpee, who was then an RCMP Corporal, now retired, spoke to Mr. Nadeau at the hospital on July 2, 2005. He said Mr. Nadeau was apparently in pain and medicated, and he did not feel it was appropriate to try and get a statement from him on that occasion. He described him as quite uncomfortable and groggy. Mr. Nadeau did, however, tell him on that occasion that the vehicle was a black SUV, possibly a new Ford Explorer, but he was not sure, and that an individual got out of the vehicle and that the person was possibly black. Eventually the RCMP were unable to pursue their investigation because there was no physical evidence and no witnesses other than Mr. Nadeau\n",

      "33  RCMP Constable Stephen Moore spoke to Mr. Nadeau on July 4, 2005. This occurred at the Kelowna General Hospital. Mr. Nadeau was in bed, he was conscious and talkative. He described the vehicle as having passed over him, or run over him, and that he got up after the vehicle passed over him. He described the passenger as being a black person, about 5' 6\". The vehicle was described as a full size SUV, black in colour, that it may be a \"Chev,\" that he thinks he saw a \"Chev\" emblem, and it had large \"beefy\" tires. He also said it could be a Hummer-type vehicle. Constable Moore was of the opinion that Mr. Nadeau was not in any condition to give a recorded statement at that time\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  Mr. Nadeau did give the police a piece of paper with a license plate number on it. This was the license plate number for the Mutanda vehicle. Mr. Nadeau has no recollection of how he got that license plate number, but Mr. McMann was clear in his evidence that he gave it to Mr. Nadeau. Mr. Nadeau was challenged in cross-examination about his earlier reluctance to name Mr. McMann as the person he received the document from. It was suggested even at trial he was reluctant to do so. My assessment of his evidence was that he did not have any personal knowledge or recollection of who gave him the document, but has since learned that it was Mr. McMann\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  On July 9, 2005, Mr. Nadeau gave a statement to RCMP Constable Wolstrom. Mr. Nadeau was in the hospital, but they left the hospital with Mr. Nadeau in a wheelchair. They went to a park across the street. He recognizes his signature on the document which was marked as exhibit 5, but does not recall signing it. This is not surprising given the length of time that has passed. At pages 5 and 6 of this statement, Mr. Nadeau mentions two memories:\n",
      "The first memory I have is the vehicle ran me over with the back passenger tire. Then broke my rib cage. Then they stopped, got out of the vehicle and saw that they hit somebody, then they got in their vehicle and drove away.\n",
      "The second memory I have is: that they drug me for 15 to 20 feet, while I screamed at them to stop. They stopped their vehicle, got out and looked underneath. They realized they hit somebody, so they got back into their vehicle, instead of pulling out from underneath, they drove over me with the back passenger's tire, then fled\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  In this statement he confirms that he did tell the people who came to assist him that he had been run over by a black SUV\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  In the statement he describes the vehicle as a \"Black SUV, Suburban or a Yukon, I'm pretty sure it was a Chevy. It had big silver [Nerf] bars (running boards).\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  He was asked to describe the occupants and his answer was \"I couldn't tell you. There was blood in my eyes. I was in shock.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  In his evidence at trial, he said he could not remember mentioning blood in his eyes. In other statements, and in his evidence at trial, he described the passenger who got out as a black person, and in some of the statements gave evidence about his height and the clothing he was wearing. At trial, he explained that when he gave this particular statement, he thought they were asking him if he could identify the people inside the vehicle as they drove away. However, I can only assume that he is trying to explain the statement because earlier on he said he could not remember even giving the statement\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "40  He said that when he gave the statement he was in pain and simply wanted to get back to the hospital. He said that his inability to describe the occupants did not apply to the person who got out\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "41  On July 19, 2005, a letter was sent from Mr. Nadeau's counsel to an ICBC adjuster. Mr. Nadeau did not recall the statement, but did recall speaking to his lawyer. In this statement he mentions the way in which the accident occurred, but the only description of the vehicle is that it was a black SUV, and that a black man got out of it at some point\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "42  Mr. Nadeau also gave a statement to an insurance adjuster on January 5, 2006. He did not recall giving that statement, but recognizes his signature on a copy of that statement (exhibits 7 and 8), which appears to be a type-written version of the same statement. In that statement, he gives a more detailed description of the black male who got out of the vehicle as a \"black male in his early 20s with baggy jeans and a ball cap and a t-shirt over a basketball jersey.\" In the statement, he described the vehicle as \"... a large model SUV, black in colour.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "43  He gave a further statement to RCMP Constable B. Singer on September 27, 2006. This has been marked as exhibit 9. Mr. Nadeau said exhibit 9 could be the statement he gave\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "44  Mr. Nadeau was cross-examined about questions he gave during his examination for discovery, and particularly Q.485. It was suggested to him that he did not know if the vehicle was a Ford, a Chevy or a GMC and his answer was \"No.\" At trial, he explained that answer by saying he thought he was being asked whether he knew the type of vehicle while he was under the vehicle\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "45  In re-examination he was asked about the statement in which he mentioned two memories. He said that he has no recollection of having two memories and that he has one distinct memory which is about how the accident happened, and that was the evidence he gave at trial\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "46  Mr. Nadeau's statements varied depending on who he was talking to. That is not unusual because the purpose for which people are asking him questions may also vary. The medical providers are more interested in treating him rather than the specifics of the accident. In addition, his physical and mental condition varied over time from the initial treatment in the hospital when he was medicated and in some pain. However, it would have been obvious to Mr. Nadeau that the precise description of the vehicle was important when he was speaking to the police or the adjuster. I accept that when Mr. Nadeau gives his evidence about the photographs in exhibit 1, tab 9, that he believes the Nerf Bars in that photograph and the vehicle was identical to the one that ran over him. However, it should be noted that these photographs were taken approximately two and a half years after the accident and while the vehicle was owned by someone else. There is no evidence that there is anything particularly distinctive about the Nerf Bars or the tires which were on that vehicle. I would also note that from the photographs there is no Chevrolet badge on this vehicle. The rear of the vehicle does have the word \"Chevrolet\" on it in small letters that are smaller than the license plate numbers, and there is no reason to believe that Mr. Nadeau would have been able to see that. In fact, his evidence at the trial was that it was the shape of the vehicle that helped him identify it as a Chevy product\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "47  There was evidence from some of the other witnesses that there were perhaps two or three other similar vehicles, or perhaps even half a dozen, or several similar vehicles at this concert. There is nothing particularly distinctive about this vehicle other than it is a black Chevy SUV-type vehicle. Despite Mr. Nadeau's assertion that the vehicle in the photographs in exhibit 1 are identical to the vehicle that struck him, I find that he is not able to give any better description, other than it was a black SUV-type vehicle, perhaps a Chevy-type with Nerf Bars and \"beefy\" tires, and that one of the occupants was black\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  Mr. Usseni gave evidence at the trial. He confirmed that he was contacted by the RCMP in the fall of 2005 to ask whether he or the vehicle had been in Kelowna on the July 1 long weekend. The RCMP first spoke to his wife who was the owner of the vehicle and left a telephone number for him to contact them. He contacted the RCMP immediately and acknowledged that in fact he and the vehicle were at the concert on July 1, 2005 in Kelowna\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "49  He confirmed that he had the use of the vehicle with the consent of his wife. His evidence is that Mr. James Mugambi, the brother of the concert organizer, Tosh Mugambi, and James Kibigi, were with him. His evidence is that he has known these individuals for a long time and has known Tosh Mugambi, Tosh's mother and sister, for many years\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "50  Ms. Mutanda also gave evidence and was cross-examined about her contact with the RCMP. For some reason, the RCMP initially asked her about where the vehicle was on the long weekend in May of 2005. They returned a second time and asked her about where the vehicle was on July 1, 2005. She believed that the vehicle was in the Vancouver area, and that her husband, Mr. Usseni, was also in the Vancouver area. She was not definitive in her answers, but thought that they had spent some time together, at least on one day of that weekend. She did recall that her husband had taken the vehicle to Kamloops on the August long weekend of that year for a soccer tournament. Even in her evidence at the trial, her memory was unclear about the July 1 weekend. It was suggested to Mr. Usseni that he had asked his wife to lie for him, but that is inconsistent with him readily admitting that he was with the vehicle in Kelowna when he first spoke to the police\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "51  Mr. Usseni's evidence was that he had been invited to the concert by the organizer, Tosh Mugambi, and that he had attended other concerts that Mr. Mugambi had organized. He did not have a pass. When they arrived at the concert, he says the vehicle was parked in the general parking area, and he, James Mugambi, and James Kibigi walked through the main gate. They were admitted by Tosh Mugambi's mother. He said he did see Mr. Mugambi at the concert, but Mr. Mugambi was quite busy. After the concert, he and James Mugambi and James Kibigi went to Tosh Mugambi's place, socialized for a while, spent the night, and then returned to the Lower Mainland the following day. He was adamant that the vehicle was with him throughout the entire time, and that he would not have allowed James Mugambi to drive it\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "52  His evidence about how he learned of the accident was somewhat confusing and unusual. When interviewed by the RCMP and at trial, he indicated that after they had left the concert that he heard the two James talking about some friend, advising them that somebody had been run over, perhaps by a white Escalade, and that it occurred in what he said was the VIP parking area. I do note that Staff Sergeant Wylie said he was alerted by a young black male that somebody had been injured, and he went to the place where the accident occurred with this young black male. When other people arrived, the young black male was gone. The question arises whether this person could have told one of the James about the accident, or told someone else who told them about the accident. However, Mr. Usseni said it was his impression that they had received this information from a friend who had heard it on the radio. This would have been within an hour of the incident actually occurring. His memory of this is quite indistinct. It is highly unlikely that the local radio station, or any radio station, would have been alerted to and reported the accident within one hour of it occurring\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "53  Tosh Mugambi's evidence was led by filing his examination for discovery. His evidence is problematic. I did not have the opportunity to observe him giving his evidence and can make no comment about his demeanour. However, he said that the security at the venue and the parking arrangements were arranged by the owner or manager of the venue. This is inconsistent with that of Mr. John Karroll who managed the property for the owners or occupiers. Mr. Karroll's evidence was clear that the concert organizers, in this case Mr. Mugambi, would be responsible for providing security, and that they would set up the VIP parking and any other parking arrangements in the manner in which they saw fit. I accept Mr. Karroll's evidence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "54  Tosh Mugambi's evidence was that he did not see his brother at the concert, although he thinks he might have seen Mr. Kibigi. He denied that James Mugambi and James Kibigi stayed at his residence that night. However, his evidence was also that there were probably 30 or more people who were at his residence and stayed, and they came and went and he did not really know who they all were. He did say that after the concert he went out drinking, but clearly at some point in time he returned to his home where there were a number of people in attendance\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "55  Tosh Mugambi also denied any knowledge of Mr. Usseni. This seems unusual because Mr. Usseni's evidence is fairly detailed about his relationship with Mr. Mugambi. He says he knows Mr. Mugambi and has known him for over 10 years. He knows Mr. Mugambi's brother, James, and Mr. Mugambi's mother and sister. He says he has been to Mr. Mugambi's home in Kelowna in 2005, and at his mother's home in Kelowna. He also gave evidence that he had been to Mr. Mugambi's clothing store in Kelowna. Mr. Usseni's wife knew of Mr. Mugambi, but did not really know him herself. She thought that her husband might know Mr. Mugambi through his activities in soccer. I am not sure why Mr. Tosh Mugambi would deny any knowledge of Mr. Usseni, but Mr. Usseni's evidence is certainly more believable on that point\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "56  It would have been helpful to have evidence from Mr. James Kibigi and Mr. James Mugambi. I was told at the beginning of the trial that some of the parties were difficult to serve and had been served substitutionally. I am not sure whether that applies to either these individuals. However, at his examination for discovery, Tosh Mugambi confirmed that he did not speak to his brother often, and that he thought he might live in the Vancouver area. He believed his brother was in contact with his mother. His mother lived in Kelowna, and there is no indication it would be difficult finding her and, perhaps through her, finding Mr. James Mugambi\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "57  Mr. Tosh Mugambi, at his examination for discovery, gave evidence that he was a good friend of Mr. James Kibigi's, and that Mr. Kibigi was living Grand Prairie, the same place Mr. Tosh Mugambi was living at the time of the discovery. The discovery occurred in Grand Prairie. He gave evidence that he sees Mr. Kibigi from time-to-time, and that it is unusual that his evidence was not available. Mr. Kibigi filed a defence to these proceedings and was represented by counsel\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "58  The onus is on the plaintiff to prove its case, including whether or not Mr. Usseni was driving the vehicle that struck the plaintiff. Mr. Nadeau suggests I draw an adverse inference because neither of these witnesses were called, but in the absence of any evidence of the efforts to obtain their evidence, either through examinations for discovery or demands to have them produced for trial, or efforts to subpoena them as a witness for the plaintiff, adverse or otherwise, I am not prepared to do so. It is of note that defences were filed on their behalf and they were represented at the trial\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "59  Mr. Nadeau argued that I should reject Mr. Usseni's evidence because his evidence seemed to be inconsistent with that of Mr. Mugambi's and common sense. It was suggested that if he was such a good friend of Tosh Mugambi's, the organizer, and had Mr. Mugambi's brother with him, that he would have had a special pass and admission to any parking areas other than perhaps the VIP area. It was suggested that he would have also had access to the VIP area itself and he says he did not. It was suggested this was not believable because he made comments about the trailer or motorhome used for performers to change, and that perhaps they had another area where they relaxed in. It was suggested this knowledge is inconsistent with not having access to that area. It was also suggested that his evidence about Tosh's mother letting him into the concert was inaccurate because Tosh Mugambi said his mother did not have anything to do with the concert. However, I do not place much weight on Mr. Tosh Mugambi's evidence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "60  It was pointed out that in Mr. Usseni's examination for discovery he thought they had stayed two nights at the concert, and yet at trial he was clear that they only stayed one night. His evidence at the examination for discovery, however, was not very clear. He was asked whether he could have been there three days after he said he thought it was two and he said it \"... could have been,\" but he could not remember the exact numbers and simply that it was \"normal\". He did advise they were to stay longer, but the concert did not last as long as expected\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "61  He was cross-examined about a sketch that he had produced of the concert site. This was produced when he gave his statement to the insurance adjuster on January 30, 2008; two and a half years after the accident. He was being cross-examined about that statement and diagram almost five years after it was created. On that document is an asterisk or a star which seems to be made in the same area where the accident occurred. He was asked what that represented and he said he simply could not remember at this time. It was suggested that this was highly suspicious because the mark appeared to be in a similar area to where the other sketches showed Mr. Nadeau being struck. It was suggested that he would not know where this occurred unless he was actually driving or in the vehicle at the time of the accident. It was suggested that it was his evidence that he made all of the marks on that document. The sketch was put to Mr. Usseni. I note the sketch was drawn on January 30, 2008; two and a half years after the accident. This was also almost five years before the trial. He was asked if the handwriting on the sketch was his and he agreed it was. He was asked if it was all his handiwork, and his response was yes, that he was trying to show what he remembered, but he is not a very good artist. During the trial, he was having trouble remembering what some of the marks on the sketch might be. I have listened to his evidence again, and it was not specifically put to him that he had made this asterisk on the sketch, although that is a reasonable inference\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "62  The significant passage of time, the understandable impact it has had on people's memories, the diminishment of those memories, and the absence of witnesses who could have given evidence, creates problems in determining what did happen on a balance of probabilities. The determination on the balance of probabilities is simply a determination of something as being more likely true, or that something being true is more likely than not. It is not close to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. However, it is also more than a mere speculation or a guess\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  Mr. Nadeau's case against Mr. Usseni really relies on the evidence that he was there with his wife's vehicle, which was a black Chevy-type SUV. He himself is black and at least one of his passengers, if not both, are also black. The vehicle that struck Mr. Nadeau was a black SUV-type vehicle, perhaps a Chevy, and that one of the passengers was a black person\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  The evidence about the license plate number is not of particular assistance. It is admitted that Ms. Mutanda's vehicle was there and that Mr. Usseni had her permission to operate it. Mr. McMann said he obtained the license plate number from the vehicle at a motel, but Mr. Usseni denies the vehicle was ever there. This conflict in the evidence between Mr. McMann and Mr. Usseni is problematic. It raises suspicions about Mr. Usseni's evidence. I ask why Mr. Usseni or Mr. McMann would lie about seeing the vehicle at a motel the following day. The fact that it was at the motel, if that is the case, is not evidence that the vehicle was involved in the accident, but does raise questions about Mr. Usseni's credibility. In his evidence at trial, Mr. McMann expressed some fear or reluctance to go to the motel on his own because all these black people would be there. He also explained that he did not give the information directly to the RCMP because he did not want Mr. Tosh Mugambi to know he had done so because Mr. Mugambi owed him money. He also said that he was concerned that he might be the subject of a police investigation involving the disappearance of somebody and did not want to come to the attention of the police, although he had nothing to do with the disappearance of anyone. Mr. McMann is presented as simply someone who knows Mr. Nadeau and an unbiased, upright member of the community. However, his explanation for his conduct certainly strikes me as odd\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "65  Mr. Nadeau's confidence about his ability to identify the vehicle increased over time, which is unusual. I am not suggesting that he is being dishonest, but it raises some questions about the reliability of his evidence. He seems to have become more certain that it was a Chevy-type vehicle after he received the license plate number from Mr. McMann. It was also suggested that Mr. Usseni's evidence was not credible because of the conflicts between his evidence and that of Mr. Tosh Mugambi's. I do have some problems with Mr. Usseni's evidence, but not because of anything Tosh Mugambi may have said in his examination for discovery. Mr. Tosh Mugambi's evidence was inconsistent with other witnesses on a number of points, and I am not satisfied his evidence is reliable or credible\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "66  The most that can be said is that the vehicle owned by Ms. Mutanda that was at the concert was similar to perhaps as many as a half of dozen other vehicles also at the concert. It was not particularly distinctive. Mr. Nadeau had very limited opportunity to make observations of the vehicle having just been run over and considering the lack of light in the area where the accident occurred. I have some suspicions about Mr. Usseni's evidence about how he learned of the accident, but his evidence was not very precise about that and he did not give any evidence that he had heard about the accident by hearing it on the radio himself. He simply had some vague recollection of how the two James might have heard about it\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "67  Mr. Usseni's evidence is that he did not have any special pass to get into the concert or to park the vehicle in any particular area. It was suggested that if he was with Tosh Mugambi's brother and friend, Mr. Kibigi, and if he was a friend of Tosh Mugambi's, he would have had access to special privileges, including access to the VIP area. However, this is inconsistent with the evidence of Tosh Mugambi which Mr. Nadeau also relies on to refute Mr. Usseni's evidence that he stayed at Mr. Mugambi's residence that night. I am satisfied that Mr. Usseni did not have any special access privileges, including access to the VIP area. He was able to enter the concert without having a ticket or a pass because of his relationship or connection to Mr. Tosh Mugambi\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  Mr. Nadeau argues that I should draw an inference that the mark on exhibit 11, the sketch prepared by Mr. Usseni, shows the place of the accident, and Mr. Usseni could only have known that at the time he made the sketch if he in fact was the person driving the vehicle that struck Mr. Nadeau. Mr. Usseni's evidence about the sketch is not very clear and, as I said earlier, probably because of the amount of time that has passed from the accident and from the time that the sketch was drawn. He did say that it was his handiwork, but it was not put to him that he in fact placed the asterisk or star on that sketch. He was asked about what it might mean and he simply could not remember. Mr. Usseni did indicate that he was aware or heard about an incident that occurred in what he described as the VIP area. This may be an explanation for why the asterisk is on the sketch. He may have simply been asked to indicate what he knew or what he had heard. This is equally consistent with him knowing indirectly where the accident may have occurred\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "69  Mr. Usseni says that he was aware that the accident purportedly happened around the VIP area, and that this was based on the discussions he heard between the James. To infer that Mr. Usseni told the adjuster that the asterisk marks the place of the accident, or admitted that he was the driver, would also require that I infer somehow the adjuster had suppressed this evidence. Alternatively, if the adjuster passed that evidence on to Mr. Usseni's counsel, that they were a party to the suppression of the evidence. I am not prepared to draw the inference that this mark, whatever it was, indicates that Mr. Usseni knew precisely where the accident happened, or that he was the driver of the vehicle that ran over Mr. Nadeau\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "70  The absence of the evidence, particularly any evidence from Mr. James Mugambi or Mr. James Kibigi, also raises some suspicions, but is not sufficient for me to draw an adverse inference against anyone. Ultimately the onus was on the plaintiff to prove its case on the balance of probabilities. This has been made more difficult because of the difficulties Mr. Nadeau had identifying the vehicle that struck him, the passage of time which has occurred, and the lack of evidence from witnesses who might have been able to add something\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  The consequences of my decision are significant to both the plaintiff and the defendants, Mr. Usseni and Ms. Mutanda.

There was an area for visitor parking and there were signs indicating the lot was a tow away zone. The court considered the definition of \"highway\" and the definition of \"public\" and referred to R. v. Joe.

The English authorities talked about \"public access\" and a private road could fall within the definition of a highway, if the public have access to it in the sense that the owner tolerates the public use of that road. The use of the road by trespassers would not fall within the definition of \"public access\". In para. 7, recording from Harrison v. Hill, [1932] S.C. (J.) 13, and the comments of Lord Justice General Clyde, pp. 16-17:\n",
      "In arriving at these conclusions I am partly influenced by the broad consideration that, as the statute is intended for the protection of the public, it is natural to suppose that the statutory traffic regulation should apply to any road on which the public may be expected to be found. Hence the inclusion of such private roads as the public (generally) is, as matter of fact, allowed to use, and the exclusion of those which the public (generally) cannot lawfully use at all\n",

Past considerations of \"access to the general public\" under the Motor Vehicle Act support this analysis.\n",
      "[9] In Laroque v. Lutz and Vusko , Ruttan J. considered a logging road open to the public on the weekends. He held that an accident occurred on a \"highway\" when it happened during the time when the public could use the road. In Ries et al v. Unger et al (unreported, B.C.S.C., June 9, 1980), Murray J. held that a privately owned parking lot was a \"highway\" when used in conjunction with a shopping centre and intended to be used by members of the public\n",

      "93  The court also considered R. v. Joe and R. v. Sport in paras. 10 and 11. The court also noted the difference between the British Columbia approach and the English approach because the British Columbia law deals with \"general public access\" not simply \"public access\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "94  The court noted that there are two definitions of \"highway\" in the Motor Vehicle Act, and that they must be read differently because of the word \"general\" in dealing with roads used for the general public and dealing with roads used for passenger vehicles and the word \"public\" in dealing with parking lots and service stations. The court went on and said at paras. 15 and 16:\n",
      "[15] A working definition of \"general public access\" from Joe and Sport and the dictionary could be:\n",
      "\"the unrestricted entry to all members of the population within implied limits for a purpose unrelated directly to the ownership of the land\".\n",
      "In the Motor Vehicle Act, this is further restricted to the general public using land for the passage of vehicles. In contrast, combining the Harrison discussion of the absence of the word \"general\", a definition of \"public access\" could be:\n",
      "\"entry to all members of the public who enter by legal right, or by implied or express permission of the owner, and as a matter of fact the public enters the property unmolested by the owner\".\n",
      "This definition would still exclude private property on to which owners and guests drive but which the general driving public would not normally enter. For example, the unfenced parking lot of an apartment building would be open to public access. But a security-guarded underground parking lot to another apartment building would not have public access because the owner definitely does not allow unrestricted entrance.\n",
      "[16] The distinction between \"general public\" and \"public\" makes sense in that the streets, lanes and highways are generally open to every member of the driving population. Access to private property is logically a more restricted group who enter by express or implied invitation. Under our legislation, this is further reduced to only that group who enters for the purpose of parking or servicing the vehicle or by public invitation. In the present case, the owner does not offer this property to the public for parking nor is there an invitation to the public to enter. It falls below the threshold of the Act's definition and should not be included as a highway. Accordingly the accused's conviction cannot stand and the appeal must be allowed\n",

      "96  In dealing with this issue, it would be easy to focus on the definition of \"public\" and whether the particular person was a member of the public. So long as the private property is used for parking or servicing of vehicles at the invitation of the person who controls it or the public has access to it for those purposes, even if not a specific invitation, it will be a highway. The property remains a highway even if members of the public who are not invited use it as well. It remains a highway even if it is used for other purposes so long as it is also used for the parking or servicing of vehicles again by invitation or as a result of the public having access to the property for those purposes.\n",

The entire grounds consisted of a field or pasture land with a permanent stage. Concert goers and anybody else attending or having business at the concert would pass from a public road onto private property through the area where the ticket wickets were set up. If they continued approximately straight ahead on what I will refer to as the main road, they would come to a fence that divided this first part of the property from the area which included the stage, the beer garden and the concession stands. There were two gates in this fence. This road led to the main gate. The concert goers would park outside of this fence, somewhere in this field, and then pass through the main gate on foot\n",

This was some distance from the main gate, and there was another gate in the fence. There was nothing barring this gate. It was an opening in the fence. Unless there was somebody there to control the entry, vehicles could pass through this gate and they would be behind and to the side of the stage. There was an area directly behind the stage which had been fenced-off and had a gate that closed and security. This is described as the VIP parking area. Some of the performers had motorhomes or trailers there where they would change or get ready for their performances. Their equipment would be stored in this area. Access to this area was strictly controlled throughout the entire concert. The area to the side and back from the front of the stage, which was between the VIP area and the fence with the two gates, was also used for parking. It has been described as secondary parking, and the gate did allow access to it as a secondary gate. It has also been described as \"overflow parking\". People did not have to be VIPs to have access to this area. The evidence is unclear as to exactly what the restrictions were for parking in this area, and I am satisfied that it was fairly fluid\n",

However, there is no evidence about what passes were needed, even when this area was controlled by security. There were passes for security, crew, media, artists, guests, all access and production. It is not even clear that everybody that entered this area with a vehicle required a pass. They used their pass to get into this parking area. On July 1, when they returned, Mr. Jong's memory is that they passed through the secondary gate and that he had to show a pass to security people at this gate. He recalls there were a couple of rows of parked vehicles in this area. He says that later in the evening, before the accident, when he came and went, that there was no security at this gate, he was not stopped, and was not required to provide any pass. Mr. Nadeau's evidence as well is that he does not recall any security at this gate later that evening on July 1, when they attended. Mr. McMann's evidence was that initially, in the secondary area, people needed a pass to park in this area, but then things got slack. Mr. Tosh Mugambi could only be sure that the VIP area was being strictly controlled. There were a number of different kinds of passes. The concert goers had ticket stubs, but there were a large number of different kinds of passes, artist passes, VIP passes, guest passes, and the guest could be anybody, including volunteers, or anybody who happened to receive a pass from either one of the organizers or even the owners of the property who had a number of passes\n",

However, that was not consistent throughout the concert, and I am satisfied that by the evening of July 1, this secondary area was no longer being controlled or restricted by the organizers or by security. The public had access to this area for the purposes of parking. The primary parking for the concert goers was in the general parking area, but there was no longer any control or restrictions on parking in the secondary area. Therefore, I am satisfied that for several hours before and, certainly at the time of the accident, this was a place in which the public had access for the purposes of parking. The public at this time included concert goers who might proceed through this secondary gate and clearly included anyone who was there in order to carry on the business of putting on or assisting in some way with the concert, or their friends or supporters.

      "Comeau v. Siemens\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "124  This involved a plaintiff being struck while crossing a parking lot. The case really depends on its facts. The defendant driver had entered the parking lot from the street without paying proper attention and struck the plaintiff. There was nothing negligent in the plaintiff's actions in walking across the parking lot to get to a street in broad daylight. The accident was caused by speed and inattention of the driver and not by any negligence on the part of the pedestrian.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "125  In this case, the plaintiff, a 16-year old girl, climbed a fence to get into a pool described as the \"source pool\" at a hot springs. The Court of Appeal dealt with what was then the Contributory Negligence Act, and said:\n",
      "[19] I think that such an approach to apportionment is wrong in law. The Negligence Act requires that the apportionment must be made on the basis of \"the degree to which each person was at fault\". It does not say that the apportionment should be on the basis of the degree to which each person's fault caused the damage. So we are not assessing degrees of causation, we are assessing degrees of fault. In this context, \"fault\" means blameworthiness. So it is a gauge of the amount by which each proximate and effective causative agent fell short of the standard of care that was required of that person in all the circumstances.\n",
      "[20] The approach to apportionment that I have described is supported by the decisions of this Court in Ottosen v. Kasper  (see particularly at p. 277) and Dao v. Sabatino  (see particularly at p. 75). In the Ottosen case the point was put in these words:\n",
      "The words used are the words of fault. The question that affects apportionment, therefore, is the weight of fault that should be attributed to each of the parties, not the weight of causation.\n",

      "...\n",
      "[24] In the apportionment of fault there must be an assessment of the degree of the risk created by each of the parties, including a consideration of the effect and potential effect of occurrences within the risk, and including any increment in the risk brought about by their conduct after the initial risk was created. The fault should then be apportioned on the basis of the nature and extent of the departure from the respective standards of care of each of the parties. In making that apportionment in this case I would apportion 60% of the fault to the defendant, Harrison Hot Springs Hotel, and 40% of the fault to the plaintiff, Cassandra Cempel.\n",

The plaintiff passed through the parking lot on her way to school, a path taken by many students. She dropped her cell phone and bent to pick it up. At that moment, the defendant driver backed his truck up running over the plaintiff. The driver was found entirely liable for the accident in the circumstances of that case. In dealing with the issue of contributory negligence, the trial judge said:\n",
      "[74] The plaintiff helpfully provided the Supreme Court of Canada authority of Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd., . In that case, the Supreme Court of Canada at para. 76 adopted the test for contributory negligence that was set out by Denning L.J. in Jones v. Livox Quarries Ltd., [1952] 2 Q.B. 608 (Eng. C.A.) at p. 615, as follows:\n",
      "Although contributory negligence does not depend on a duty of care, it does depend on foreseeability. Just as actionable negligence requires the foreseeability of harm to others, so [too] contributory negligence requires the foreseeability of harm to oneself. A person is guilty of contributory negligence if he ought reasonably to have foreseen that, if he did not act as a reasonable, prudent man, he might be hurt himself; and in his reckonings he must take into account the possibility of others being careless\n",

      "128  The plaintiff in the case at bar had been drinking and he knew that alcohol was being served at this music concert. He was also aware that vehicles were coming and going from this particular area and that it was dark. He was aware of the vehicle moving in his direction, but assumed that either the driver of the vehicle or somebody else, perhaps security personnel, would direct the vehicle away from the area in which he was crouched down or squatting.

However, in the circumstances, he should also have taken steps to protect himself from the potential harm that could ensue if the driver did not do so. It would have been a simple matter for him to have kept an eye on the vehicle which he knew was travelling towards him. Although I am satisfied that the driver of the vehicle must bear the majority of the responsibility for the accident, Mr. Nadeau's failure to keep a lookout in the circumstances, also contributed to the accident\n",

However, as I have pointed out earlier, there was nothing he could have done to prevent the rear wheels of the vehicle passing over him after it had stopped with him still under the vehicle. I apportion the liability 85 percent against the driver and 15 percent against Mr. Nadeau. This apportionment relates to the injuries he suffered when he was first struck by the vehicle and before the rear wheels of the vehicle passed over him. This may create some difficulties in determining which injuries were caused by which incident, but in the particular circumstances of this case, there were two distinct actions by the driver, the first of which Mr. Nadeau was contributory negligent towards the second in which he was not.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "12  In 2004, Mr. Reynolds moved from Calgary to Naramata with Christine Brennan, his common law spouse of 22 years. They purchased an older home in Naramata that year which required extensive renovations, both for living and to accommodate the business operated by Mr. Reynolds\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "13  After purchasing that home, Mr. Reynolds immediately undertook significant renovations to its basement in order to accommodate the necessary production, packaging and shipping facilities for the aromatherapy business. He has operated that business from there since that time\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "14  After completion of work on the business part of the home, Mr. Reynolds also began to do renovations to its upstairs, as well as considerable work on the surrounding yard which was also in need of repair, and much new landscaping\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "15  All of that work on the home and yard, other than the work on the business premises, was carried out sporadically and primarily by Mr. Reynolds himself when he had time but with some assistance from relatives when available. The planned renovations were not, however, fully completed in the five years prior to the collision\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  The home-based business of Essential Nature Inc. was also a very hands-on endeavour for Mr. Reynolds. He not only oversaw all of its operations but also developed various blends of oils and other products. He also imported the oils to create the products for packaging and sale, and branded and packaged them at the home in Naramata. Mr. Reynolds was also his company's primary salesperson and travelled extensively throughout western Canada to market its product both to retailers and at various trade shows\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  The evidence establishes that before the collision Mr. Reynolds was in good health, was very energetic and worked long hours, both in his business and at home, with very little time off from either pursuit. His work days were long and at times either physically or mentally demanding, or both. However, he very much enjoyed what he did and was good at it\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  Mr. Reynolds' weekends and those nights when he did not work in the business were also busy. They were filled with work on the various house renovations he undertook, as well as his landscaping efforts. As noted above, Mr. Reynolds did most of the renovation work himself. He enjoyed it and was either capable at it from the start or learned how to do various aspects of it, both for his own satisfaction and because it was economically advantageous to do so\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  Mr. Reynolds also much enjoyed cooking and undertook much of that task, as well as the bulk of the household shopping and house cleaning. While Ms. Brennan did some of that work in the home and also assisted from time to time in the business when able to do so, her ability to do so was compromised by her affliction with serious and often long-lasting migraine headaches which frequently incapacitated her\n",
      "======\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "23  Before turning back to Naramata after the accident, Mr. Reynolds phoned Ms. Brennan to tell her what had happened. He became very emotional\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  That emotional distraught was the harbinger of things to come. Mr. Reynolds subsequently endured anxiety, verging upon near panic, about driving on highways especially in winter and even as a passenger\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "25  That anxiety has precluded him from doing much of the travel by car or truck that he used to do for both business and pleasure\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  After trying to cope with those anxiety issues without medical assistance for more than a year after the accident - by driving with others or by flying to tradeshows at considerable expense - Mr. Reynolds eventually decreased the number of trade shows in which his company would be involved\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  Also, since June 10, 2010, after a referral from his family doctor, Dr. Douglas Leitner, Mr. Reynolds has been intermittently seeing Ms. Ann Reinders, a Registered Clinical Counsellor, who has tried to help Mr. Reynolds with his anxiety issues surrounding driving, as well as other areas of his life where anxiety has interfered with his depressed mood and other emotional problems, and also the chronic pain he has endured, emanating from the collision and its physical and emotional impact upon him\n",

      "During his first sessions Mr. Reynolds described the issues he was struggling with. These included but were not necessarily limited to:\n",
      "* Ongoing anxiety.\n",
      "* Driving anxiety, or anxiety as a passenger in a vehicle, were especially problematic. He described how winter driving and highway driving are incredibly difficult for him. Even being a passenger on winter highway drives, set him into a near panic state.\n",
      "* Ongoing headaches and persistent severe neck pain and soft tissue discomfort.\n",
      "* Difficulty sleeping. He cannot lie down to sleep so sits propped up and any movement in the bed results in dizziness and fear.\n",
      "* He has had an attack of severe vertigo and lives in fear of recurring attacks.\n",
      "* He described a \"sense of doom\" that occurs when winter weather threatens.\n",
      "* He described himself as feeling constantly afraid, and needing to push himself to keep going.\n",
      "* Mr. Reynolds described \"a sense of shame\" that he has not been able to recover and feels that he is being negatively judged by others. He described \"a sense of being less than.\" and fights with the idea that, \"I should just be able to suck it up.\"\n",
      "* He also described a sense of \"disconnection\" and \"difficulty in staying on task.\" This in turn affects his ability to work efficiently.\n",
      "* He stated that he is \"never able to be still and always has to be on the go.\" This in turn leads to a sense of exhaustion.\n",
      "* Mr. Reynolds's symptoms were so severe that he had given up driving distances, and needed to fly to carry out his business. He stated that any turbulence in the air also increases his anxiety.\n",
      "* He stated that he has become less social as a result of symptoms and is much more introverted than before the accident.\n",
      "Mr. Reynolds was very clear that all of this is a huge change from his pre-accident personality. He stated that, \"I was a very competent and confident person.\" \"I had a sense of adventure. I was raised in Saskatchewan and was a confident winter driver.\"\n",
      "When he returned in March 2012 he described how:\n",
      "\"It feels as if I am slipping again.\"\n",
      "He related a number of incidents where he had panic attacks as a passenger in a vehicle.\n",
      "He was still experiencing severe headaches and neck pain.\n",
      "He had developed a fear of heights that he had never had before [the] accident and told me that scenes on television could activate this.\n",
      "He also continued to feel judged by others and a sense of shame that he was still experiencing difficulties\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  Ms. Reinders' report of Mr. Reynolds' condition and his statements to her concerning the effects of the collision upon him is consistent with his testimony at trial, as well as the observations of all of the lay witnesses who testified, all of whom I find to be credible witnesses upon whose evidence I can safely rely\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  Ms. Reinders reached the conclusion with respect to Mr. Reynolds' condition that:\n",
      "My professional opinion is that the symptoms that Mr. Reynolds described fall under the three categories of arousal, withdrawal, and intrusion, which are experienced after trauma. These come about as a result of a dys-regulated nervous system, due to the exposure to a life-threatening event that he was unable to protect himself from, and which left him overwhelmed and helpless. My belief is that his symptoms of vertigo, and his fear of the vertigo returning, further added to his anxiety. The presence of persistent pain and its impact on all facets of his life also played into his emotional health struggles. These were all issues that occurred after the accident and which he had not experienced before\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  Concerning her treatment of Mr. Reynolds, Ms. Reinders wrote in her same report:\n",
      "... I worked with Mr. Reynolds to establish a sense of being safe in my office and in establishing a strong therapeutic relationship.\n",
      "Initially the focus was on trauma education so that Mr. Reynolds had an increased understanding of his symptoms such as anxiety, and how they relate to a dys-regulated nervous system.\n",
      "I also included education about grief and loss, and how these are major issues when there is a loss of pre-accident function and life-style.\n",
      "I lent Mr. Reynolds the book \"Crash Course - A Self Healing Guide for Auto Accident Trauma & Recovery\" by Dianne Poole-Heller. This provided further education and information about trauma and healing specific to motor vehicle accidents. This was especially useful due to the limited ability for Mr. Reynolds to attend counselling consistently due to financial constraints.\n",
      "Interventions used included teaching Mr. Reynolds grounding, present moment awareness, mindfulness, breathing, and visualization strategies, in order to self soothe and settle his feelings of anxiety and help him learn to self-regulate.\n",
      "We discussed the link between stress, hyper-arousal, and pain, and the importance of using his strategies on an ongoing basis in order to minimize all three.\n",
      "Time was spent looking at creating pre-sleep routines in order to improve sleep patterns.\n",
      "We addressed Mr. Reynolds' feelings of vulnerability and helplessness, as well as his sense that, \"I should be able to cope better', which is essentially shame, often a component of trauma.\n",
      "During the appointments on March 2nd 9th and 16th 2011 a combination of EMDR, visualization and mind body strategies were used to work with persistent images and sensations from the accident.\n",
      "Strength based conversations were also a consistent part of the counselling process in order to build a stronger sense of agency and coping\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "32  As to her assessment of the effect of those interventions, Ms. Reinders wrote:\n",
      "In my opinion Mr. Reynolds was a highly motivated client and worked hard both during and between sessions. He was at all times fully engaged in his counselling.\n",
      "He made good initial gains in learning to self-soothe and use the strategies taught to self regulate. He always left sessions calmer than when he arrived and with an increased sense of being able to cope. He expressed that the understanding about how his symptoms were a consequence of the neuro-physiology of trauma was reassuring to him and thus deceased his sense of \"not being good enough.\"\n",
      "When left without counselling support it was difficult for Mr. Reynolds to continue to use his coping strategies, due to the pressures of work, ongoing pain and financial stress.\n",
      "After the sessions in March 2011, [Mr.] Reynolds appeared to make a real shift in his ability to cope with his driving anxiety and he did not return to counselling for almost a year. Unfortunately he was unable to maintain this level of progress and on his return to counselling in March 2012 he was struggling with many of the same issues.\n",
      "I believe that more continuous counselling would have supported him in being able to maintain his progress.\n",
      "He pushed himself to drive despite his anxiety and certainly made gains in his ability to do this, as he had driven to Saskatchewan prior to his appointment in March 2012.\n",
      "His ongoing pain and vertigo symptoms complicated his progress and when seen for the last time in November 2012 he stated, \"This has all be going on for so long. I feel fried, like my skin is really thin and I have no protection.\n",
      "======\n",

      "33  As to her analysis of Mr. Reynolds' present situation and future intervention to assist him, Ms. Reinders wrote:\n",
      "In my opinion [Mr.] Reynolds continues to suffer from symptoms in the three post trauma categories of arousal, intrusion and withdrawal.\n",
      "His ongoing anxiety, pain, issues with balance, and his fear of re-triggering a major vertigo attack impact all aspects of his life including his social life, his relationship with his wife, his work, and financial status. He is no longer able to take part in many leisure activities he enjoyed before his accident, such as skiing. This has led to unresolved grief and loss that further impact Mr. Reynolds.\n",
      "Managing his ongoing pain and sleep disturbances continue to be issues that should be addressed in counselling.\n",
      "...\n",
      "He continues to suffer from many of the symptoms he described when first attending counselling in June 2010.\n",
      "Counselling sessions were not started until over a year after the accident and were then intermittent due to a lack of funding and lack of financial means.\n",
      "He has attended a total of twelve counselling sessions. When contacted in July 2013 Mr. Reynolds was clear that he very much wants to return to counselling to work on the issues that are still outstanding.\n",
      "I have found Mr. Reynolds to be a motivated client who wants to be as well as possible.\n",

      "34  In summary, after reviewing all of the medical and lay evidence in this case, I have concluded that in addition to the mood anxiety issues, and sleep and pain issues specifically referred to by Ms. Reinders, Mr. Reynolds also suffered the following injuries that were caused by the defendants' negligence:\n",
      "Neck injuries (primarily on the right side) and associated headaches which manifested within 24 hours of the collision and have persisted with little abatement. His neck pain is also exacerbated by forward flexion. Also associated with the persistent neck pain and headaches is occasional reduced sensation in the 3rd to 5th digits on the right hand.\n",
      "Low back injuries primarily on the right side in respect of which Dr. Heather Underwood, a specialist in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, said in her medical-legal opinion of June 13, 2013:\n",
      "... Mr. Reynolds had no previous history of low back pain, to my knowledge. He did not seek any therapeutic treatments for his back prior to his February 25, 2009 accident.\n",
      "Post-accident, discomfort involving the right greater than left low back region was reported. He reported intermittently having exacerbation of his discomfort. At the time of my assessment, he reported recently have a flare of the low back region with radiation to the posterior aspect of the right leg with pain but no overt numbness. He denied any weakness of the lower extremity. Stiffness involving the right hip was also reported.\n",
      "At the time of my assessment, it was difficult to fully discern range of motion as he is hesitant with movements due to his fear of dizziness. He did not appear to have any limitations in forward flexion of the back. He did have some reduced lumbar lordosis and prominence of the right ribs compared to left, so there does appear to be a rotational component in the lumbar spine. He had no overt discomfort with stressing of the lumbar spine or pelvis. Reflexes were symmetrical. Lower extremity strength was normal. He had no gross abnormalities involving the hip, knees, or ankle region.\n",
      "Mr. Reynolds' low back pain appears to be musculoligamentous in nature. It is currently occurring on an intermittent basis. His most current exacerbations are likely related to his intermittent neck pain and discomfort with positioning. No overt signs of facet tenderness or radiculopathy were noted at the time of my assessment. There was no evidence of overt disc protrusion.\n",
      "Vestibular injuries causing dizziness directly related to or emanating from his neck injuries, giving rise to a sense of disequilibrium aggravated by certain neck movement of prolonged holding of his neck in one position while doing certain tasks. This also results in nausea and sleeplessness. Concerning these injuries, including a suggestion by the defence that some of Mr. Reynolds' vestibular symptoms were not directly related to the collision, Dr. Holly Stevens, a specialist in Otolaryngology, observed Mr. Reynolds and also sent him for testing related to his vestibular symptoms. In her medical legal opinion dated July 2, 2013, Dr. Stevens stated:\n",
      "Shortly after the motor vehicle accident, at least within a couple of days, he began to complain of a vestibular problem which he described as feeling like he was not completely on balance, moving forward when he was not, or having the floor drop beneath him. Since the accident he has never felt completely normal. His sense of disequilibrium is aggravated by certain movements of his neck such as turning it quickly to the left or right, having his neck in certain anterior flexed positions for prolonged times (such as working on the computer or mixing his oils), and lying prone. These positions are often associated with some degree of neck spasm. When his neck is aggravated his vestibular symptoms are worse. He complained of tinnitus immediately after the accident and this is still present, although less severe than it was previously. He has not complained of hearing loss.\n",
      "...\n",
      "In the summer of 2009, about 5 months after his motor vehicle accident, Jeff awoke with acute rotary vertigo which was consistent with BPPV. He was seen by a physiotherapist and had a particle repositioning maneuver done. He did not have a recurrence. His symptoms during that episode were very typical of BPPV and completely unlike the ongoing chronic vestibular symptoms that he has suffered since his motor vehicle accident, both before and after the acute BPPV episode. It is possible that his preceding injury could have contributed to that, but BPPV is common and this could have been a spontaneous event. At any rate, he has not suffered from it consequently. It is significant, however, in that the experience was very trying for him and he is very fearful of that occurring again.\n",
      "He saw Dr. Eytan David who performed an independent medical exam. Dr. David suggested to him that BPPV might be playing a role in his current symptoms and that repeated maneuvers to alleviate BPPV might be worth trying. At that time, Mr. Reynolds was not willing to do this. On the basis of my examination, I do not think that BPPV is a contributing factor to his current vestibular symptoms. He has also been demonstrated to have a vestibular abnormality on the basis of other testing which is mentioned below.\n",
      "Mr. Reynolds was sent to the Neuro-otology Unit on 2 occasions; on January 13, 2011 and March 21, 2012. The report of Dr. Art Malinson is available. The vestibular evoked myogenic potentials were abnormal bilaterally and he also had abnormalities on the dynamic posturography. A repeat test in March of 2012 showed some improvement although the results were still below normal. Similarly his VEMP testing did show improvement but there were still abnormalities. These 2 tests are objective evidence of a vestibular disturbance.\n",
      "After the initial visit in November of 2010 I reviewed Mr. Reynolds in March and August of 2011, and April of 2012. During that time, Mr. Reynolds' vestibular symptoms had not improved. He constantly had the sensation of disorientation in space. This sensation was worse when his neck was in spasm or in pain. Although as a child he had motion sickness as an automobile passenger, he had always been able to drive a car without any difficulty whereas post traumatically motion sickness has occurred even when driving. He has tolerated this as best he can and takes Gravol when necessary, but it has made driving long distances very difficult or impossible for him.\n",
      "Jeff was seen again on July 2nd. His vestibular symptoms, disorientation in space, feeling like he is on a boat, a sensation of bobbing plus the motion sickness while driving persist. At that time his standard Romberg with eyes closed caused him to sway abnormally and even with eyes open he was unsteady. He has difficulty maintaining tandem gait with eyes open and cannot perform it with eyes closed. There is limitation of his neck movement. He was seen again on July 23 having agreed to have a Dix Hallpike maneuver. This caused neck pain and gave him a sense of moving and feeling unsteady but did not elicit the classic rotary vertigo and nystagmus typical of BPPV.\n",
      "Mr. Reynolds has seen a number of health practitioners for his symptoms and his treatment to date has been appropriate and helpful to the extent possible. He should continue with his physiotherapy and should also continue with balance improvement exercises which have been given to him.\n",
      "It is my opinion that the neck injuries are the primary causation of his ongoing vestibular symptoms. Tearing or strain of ligaments, muscle fascia and tendons produce neck pain and inflammation resulting in irritation and stimulation of nerve roots involved with the vestibular system. The exact mechanism of cervicogenic vertigo is not known but the syndrome is documented in the literature. [footnote omitted.] As demonstrated by VEMP (vestibular evoked myogenic potential), there is a relationship between the neck and the otoliths and his VEMP has been demonstrated to be abnormal.\n",
      "Since his motor vehicle accident in 2009, he continues to be symptomatic with respect to his vestibular symptoms. From a practical perspective this affects him when driving as it causes significant motion sickness and this limits his capacity to travel and market his business. It also affects his ability to maintain the fiscal aspects of business (working on his computer) as well as the production aspects (producing his oils). Similarly, his domestic capabilities have been compromised. This has been well outlined in the report by Dr. Drummond. However I expect there are also less tangible effects on his function, as in my experience with these patients, it takes extra effort and energy to cope with chronic vestibulopathy.\n",
      "The other disabilities relate to his soft tissue injuries and other musculoskeletal problems as reviewed by others. However what has not been considered to a great extent is the consequence these injuries have played in Jeff's sleep. He has difficulty getting to sleep, sleeps for brief periods, and wakes up. He usually feels unrested. He is most likely sleep deprived. This makes coping with all the other issues much more difficult.\n",
      "I think it is highly unlikely that Mr. Reynolds will ever return to his premorbid state. He is still hopeful that he will continue to improve and is reluctant to modify his lifestyle as a result of his motor vehicle accident. However he realizes that he is not capable of functioning at the level that he did previously. Consequently he has employed extra people to help him at work and at home. This will allow him to concentrate his efforts in the areas that are most important to him, even though it may aggravate his symptoms. The occupational therapist is working hard with him to maximize his function and minimize his symptoms to the extent that is possible.\n",
      "Going forward, because his sleep disturbance is a significant problem, I feel it is worthwhile for him to be evaluated by a sleep therapist and I have referred him to Dr. Cridland at The Kelowna Sleep Clinic. I suggested he might see a certified vestibular therapist, who also practices in Kelowna, and Jeff prefers not to drive that distance. Although his vestibular symptoms decrease his productivity, he does not consider this to be his prime disability and is more interested in concentrating on his musculoskeletal problems. He can practice vestibular exercises at home and I think it is reasonable for him to forego this assessment now. He has agreed to try amitriptyline to see if it will increase his vestibular tolerance. I have started him on 10 mg at bedtime.\n",
      "Although he is still hopeful that he will undergo a complete recovery, it is my opinion, especially considering the chronicity of symptoms, that this is unlikely\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  I find that the assertions made by Mr. Reynolds to both Dr. Stevens and Dr. Underwood to which I earlier referred are consistent with his own evidence at trial which I find to be credible\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  I also accept Dr. Stevens' opinion concerning Mr. Reynolds' vestibular injuries, and find that her observations of Mr. Reynolds' condition and symptomology is both reliable and accords with the preponderance of the medical and lay evidence concerning Mr. Reynolds' health since the collision.\n",
      "V. CAUSATION\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  The totality of the medical evidence in this case leads me to conclude the injuries to which I have alluded in the foregoing section of this judgment were all caused by the defendants' negligence. Although the defendants asserted that the serious episode of vertigo suffered by Mr. Reynolds about five months after the collision was spontaneous and unrelated to the accident, and while I accept Dr. Stevens' opinion that that single episode may be unrelated to the collision, I also accept her opinion that it is not likely a contributing factor to his ongoing vestibular symptoms.\n",
      "VI. ONGOING EFFECTS OF INJURIES AND \n",
      " PROGNOSES\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  As indicated in the various medical opinions provided on behalf of the plaintiff, the injuries which he suffered in the collision have now been ongoing for almost five years with little improvement. Although it remains possible that with continued counselling his mood and anxiety issues and his fear of driving may subside, the fact that they have persisted for so many years convinces me that it would be overly optimistic to find that those conditions will be greatly ameliorated even with the treatment recommended by Ms. Reinders\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  Similarly I find that Mr. Reynolds' still continuing problems with vertigo as well as the pain emanating from his neck injuries which deprive him of regular sleep, as well as with the incidence of migraine headaches which he continues to suffer are unlikely to substantially improve with time\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "40  The effects of the injuries suffered by Mr. Reynolds have had a severe impact upon his life in the years since the collision and will likely continue to preclude any return to his pre-collision condition\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "41  While Mr. Reynolds' injuries and the effect of them have not precluded him from working in his business they have compromised the amount of work he is able to do, to the extent that he has had to either reduce the amount of work that he undertakes -- for example, attendance at trade shows requiring travel -- or has had to hire others to do some of the work he would otherwise have been able to do himself. I will address more fully the extent of those limitations when discussing his claims for damages for past and future income losses\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "42  Along with the negative impact of his injuries on his work capacity, those injuries have dramatically altered Mr. Reynolds' ability to do those things which he previously did and enjoyed outside of work. Lack of sleep, anxiety, pain, vertigo, and fear of exacerbation of the effects of vertigo have all dominated and continue to dominate his life both with respect to his ability to enjoy life and also with respect to his ability to do household tasks and yard work, all of which I will discuss in more detail when considering the quantification of his damages claims.\n",
      "VII. ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "43  In determining the appropriate compensation for Mr. Reynolds' losses caused by the defendants' negligence, I have done so based upon my findings that the effects of those injuries have already been suffered for almost five years and that while he may obtain some relief in future from that suffering through medical intervention or counselling, it is likely that his suffering will continue at a high level for the foreseeable future.\n",
      " A. Non-Pecuniary Damages\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "44  The purpose of non-pecuniary damages in personal injury cases is to compensate the injured party for their pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of enjoyment of amenities caused by the fault of a tortfeasor\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "45  In Stapley v. Hejslet,  [Stapley] at para. 46, Kirkpatrick J.A. set out a useful, non-exhaustive list of factors that offer guidance as to what may influence an award of non-pecuniary damages. The list included the:\n",
      "age of the plaintiff;\n",
      "nature of the injury;\n",
      "severity and duration of pain;\n",
      "disability;\n",

      "loss or impairment of life\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "46  Kirkpatrick J.A. went on to say:\n",
      "I would add the following factors, although they may arguably be subsumed in the above list:\n",
      "impairment of family, marital and social relationships;\n",
      "impairment of physical and mental abilities;\n",
      "loss of lifestyle; and\n",
      "the plaintiff's stoicism (as a factor that should not, generally speaking, penalize the plaintiff: Giang v. Clayton,  (QL), )\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "47  With those considerations in mind I will now assess the compensation to which I consider Mr. Reynolds is entitled for his pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life, for the injuries he suffered as a consequence of the defendant's negligence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  Mr. Arnold, on behalf of Mr. Reynolds, asserted that an appropriate award of non-pecuniary damages in this case would be from $130,000 to $170,000. He seeks an award of $150,000. In support of that submission he referred me to the following decisions in which the plaintiffs suffered similar injuries to those from which Mr. Reynolds suffered: Eccleston v. Dresen,  ($120,000 in non-pecuniary damages); Houston v. Kine,  ($110,000 in non-pecuniary damages); MacKenzie v. Rogalasky,  ($110,000 in non-pecuniary damages); Zen v. Redhead,  ($110,000 in non-pecuniary damages); Crane v. Lee,  ($110,000 in non-pecuniary damages); Felix v. Hearne,  ($200,000 in non-pecuniary damages); and Cantin v. Petersen,  ($150,000 in non-pecuniary damages)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "49  Ms. Harris, on behalf of the defendants, suggested that the range of non-pecuniary damages for the injuries suffered by Mr. Reynolds should be considered as being from $40,000 to $90,000, and submits that an award of $50,000 would adequately compensate Mr. Reynolds for his non-pecuniary losses. In making that submission she referred me to: Verhnjak v. Papa,  ($40,000 in non-pecuniary damages); Moukhine v. Collins,  ($90,000 in non-pecuniary damages); and Yang v.Chan,  ($60,000 in non-pecuniary damages). In suggesting that $50,000, rather than up to $90,000, would appropriately compensate Mr. Reynolds for his non-pecuniary losses in this case, Ms. Harris submitted that Mr. Reynolds' injuries are not as disabling as those suffered by Mr. Moukhine because, like Mr. Yang, Mr. Reynolds is able to continue to work. She also submits that the amounts awarded to Mr. Reynolds should be somewhat lower than that received by Mr. Yang because of a greater likelihood of improvement to his symptomology when compared to Mr. Yang\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "50  Other cases are of some, but limited, assistance in assessing an award of non-pecuniary damages. Each person who endures a debilitating injury is unique and the nature of the injuries suffered by plaintiffs and their life circumstances will rarely be identical\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "51  In my opinion, the evidence in this case supports an award of damages for Mr. Reynolds' pain and suffering at a more substantial level than that suggested by the defendants. Their submissions do not, in my respectful view, sufficiently address the chronicity of Mr. Reynolds' injuries and their effect upon his daily living, and places undue emphasis on the likelihood of an amelioration of the effect of those injuries in the future, given the length of time for which they have now persisted\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "52  Mr. Reynolds suffered serious and debilitating injuries in the collision, which have had a profound impact upon his enjoyment of life. The most serious of those injuries are the injuries to his neck and the vestibular injuries he suffered which separately or in tandem have caused fear of further injury from rapid movement, migraine headaches, anxiety, fear of driving and other travel, and sleeplessness. The injuries are still unresolved and will likely continue to affect all aspects of his enjoyment of life\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "53  I accept the evidence of the lay witnesses that prior to the collision Mr. Reynolds was a man of almost boundless energy and enthusiasm for life. While he still tries hard to work in his business and does so with some success, his enjoyment of his work is now compromised by his medical conditions caused by the collision. His life is now far more one-dimensional than before, with work and the energy required to continue with his business now dominating all other aspects of life for which he now has both less energy and time because of the toll that simply working now exacts\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "54  As to the prognoses for improvement in future, Dr. Underwood opined that it is extremely guarded. Dr. Stevens concluded that it is highly unlikely that Mr. Reynolds will return to his pre-collision state. She also stated that Mr. Reynolds downplays his symptoms\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "55  Although I consider the award for non-pecuniary damages suggested by the defendant to be inordinately low, I also do not agree with Mr. Arnold's submission that an award of $150,000 is appropriate in this case. In my view, the injuries suffered by Ms. Felix which resulted in a non-pecuniary damage award of $200,000, and by Ms. Cantin which resulted in a non-pecuniary award of $150,000, were more serious and debilitating than those suffered by Mr. Reynolds. They involved more serious physical injuries requiring surgery, and more severe psychological problems in the case of Ms. Felix, and more cognitive and psychological problems in the case of Ms. Cantin\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "56  In all of the circumstances I find that an award of $120,000 will appropriately compensate Mr. Reynolds for his past, present and future pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. That award recognizes the impact of the debilitating effect of the neck injury suffered by him and the related dizziness and vertigo that are similar to those suffered by Mr. Moukhine and Mr. Yang, both of whom were awarded $90,000, but also allows compensation for the debilitating effects of his past, present and future mood and anxiety disorders and the sleeplessness which has so dominated his life since the collision and will likely continue.\n",
      " B.  Past Income Loss and Loss of Future Earning Capacity\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "57  Quantification of Mr. Reynolds' loss of income since the collision before trial and assessment of his loss of future earning capacity are the most difficult issues that arise for determination in this case\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "58  That is so because, notwithstanding the debilitating effects of the injuries suffered by Mr. Reynolds, he has with considerable effort been able to continue to do much of the same work he once did to allow his business to prosper. To the extent he has been unable to do so by his own efforts in the various aspects of the business which he previously did largely by himself, he has by careful use of replacement labour, both paid and unpaid, been able to not only maintain but increase the profitability of his aromatherapy business\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "59  These issues of past income loss and loss of future income earning capacity are further complicated by the methodology by which Mr. Reynolds sought to quantify his losses, by separating from his business operations those aspects of costs and alleged diminished profits related to the company's decreased participation in trade shows from its increased overall profits, from the overall operations primarily conducted from the business conducted from the home. Mr. Reynolds justifies that approach by reason of his anxiety related to travel which resulted in not only his hiring of staff to do much of the work at trade shows he would otherwise have done himself, and by reason of the fact that he chose to reduce the company's participation in trade shows because of those increased costs which adversely impacted the profitability of its participation in trade shows\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "60  Although in most cases quantification of past income loss and assessment of future loss of earning capacity require somewhat different analyses because of what is known as a fact at the time of trial as opposed to what the evidence establishes is likely to occur in future, in this case counsel for Mr. Reynolds has advanced his claims for both past and future earnings losses as claims for loss of earning capacity. He has done so because of the allegation in both instances that although the company operated by Mr. Reynolds has prospered, notwithstanding his injuries and diminished ability to perform work he would otherwise perform, that has been accomplished only by assiduous use of paid and unpaid replacement labour which he submits should be compensated for by an award of damages for loss of earning capacity\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "61  In Perren v. Lalari, , [Perren], our Court of Appeal settled the question of how claims for impaired earning capacity can be addressed. After a long discussion and review of different approaches that had been applied in past cases, Garson J.A. stated for the court at para. 32:\n",
      "[32] A plaintiff must always prove, as was noted by Donald J.A. in Steward, , by Bauman J. in Chang, , and by Tysoe J.A. in Romanchych, , that there is a real and substantial possibility of a future event leading to an income loss. If the plaintiff discharges that burden of proof, then depending upon the facts of the case, the plaintiff may prove the quantification of that loss of earning capacity, either on an earnings approach, as in Steenblok, , or a capital asset approach, as in Brown. The former approach will be more useful when the loss is more easily measurable, as it was in Steenblok. The latter approach will be more useful when the loss is not as easily measurable, as in Pallos, , and Romanchych. A plaintiff may indeed be able to prove that there is a substantial possibility of a future loss of income despite having returned to his or her usual employment. That was the case in both Pallos and Parypa, . But, as Donald J.A. said in Steward, an inability to perform an occupation that is not a realistic alternative occupation is not proof of a future loss\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "62  Mr. Reynolds asserts that while that analysis specifically concerned claims for future impaired earning capacity, it is equally appropriate to the consideration of his past income loss claims with the only real difference being that for the past loss of earning capacity claim, it is based on what he submits has in fact occurred to date as opposed to whether the evidence establishes a real and substantial possibility of a future event leading to income loss\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  In presenting his claims for past loss of income and future loss of income earning capacity, Mr. Reynolds postulated two methods of assessment. Both are essentially based upon an earnings approach rather than a loss of capital asset approach. Having said that, however, Mr. Arnold also relies upon the \"capital assets\" principles enunciated by Finch J. (as he then was) in Brown v Golaiy  [Brown], which have been approved and frequently referenced by the Court of Appeal on numerous occasions, including in Perren\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  In Brown at page 4, Finch J. stated:\n",
      "The means by which the value of the lost, or impaired, asset is to be assessed varies of course from case to case. Some of the considerations to take into account in making that assessment include whether:\n",
      "The plaintiff has been rendered less capable overall from earning income from all types of employment;\n",
      "the plaintiff is less marketable or attractive as an employee to potential employers;\n",
      "the plaintiff has lost the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities which might otherwise have been open to him, had he not been injured; and\n",
      "The plaintiff is less valuable to himself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour market\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "65  The first method of assessment of his claims for loss of past and future earnings (which Mr. Arnold has characterized as the \"simple method\"), is based upon Mr. Reynolds' evidence that he believes he needs one full time person to make up for the loss of his pre-collision ability to both manage the affairs of the company and participate fully in all aspects of production, marketing and distribution in the \"main business\" of the company. His assertion that one full time employee would compensate for his loss of ability to do all he previously did is based on his evidence that he worked much faster than others in the various tasks that now require replacement of his labour, and he can no longer do the heavy lifting of product involved in the storage and mixing processes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "66  Mr. Reynolds suggests that the cost of that one full time person should be assessed at $15 per hour for a 40 hour week and 48 weeks per year, for a total of $33,547 per year, inclusive of Workers' Compensation Benefits. Based on those calculations, Mr. Reynolds postulates past loss of income of approximately $145,000, calculated as being approximately $120,000 attributed to the \"main business\" and $25,000 to \"tradeshows.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "67  Concerning his claims for future loss under the \"simple method\" advanced by Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Arnold has submitted that based upon the cost of one full time employee at a rate of $33,547 per year, now necessary because of the effects of the collision upon Mr. Reynolds' work capacity for the next 20 years (assuming a pre-accident anticipated retirement age of 70, and discounted for the present value of money), should result in an award of approximately $485,000 for the \"main business.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  In addition, Mr. Reynolds suggests that an award of approximately $400,000 should be made to compensate for his lack of capacity to obtain the benefits of trade shows he can no longer do because of his post-accident condition. That award is postulated on seven shows per year at $4,500 per show for 15 years to age 65, discounted for the present value of money\n",

      "69  In total, based upon that \"simple method\" of assessment, Mr. Reynolds suggests awards of approximately $145,000 for past earnings lost and $885,000 for future loss of earning capacity\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "70  Under the alternative method of analysis postulated by Mr. Reynolds (characterized by Mr. Arnold as the \"Analysis of Business Records Complex Method\"), the claims advanced would also result in a past income loss award of approximately $145,000, and future loss of capacity awards of $750,000, assuming a 15 year period of loss, and $880,000, assuming a 20 year loss period\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  The analysis provided by Mr. Reynolds in support of the \"complex method\" for past income loss seeks to compare the cost of wages other than payments to Mr. Reynolds as a ratio of the business income of the company in the two years prior to collision, with the increasing ratio of such third party costs in the years 2009 to 2012\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "72  Based on the numerous assumptions made by him, Mr. Reynolds calculates that the business incurred additional expenses of approximately $115,000 in the \"main business,\" incurred because Mr. Reynolds was incapacitated from doing all the work he could otherwise have done. He also compared the ratio of costs associated with trade shows to the profit he assessed was made in the years prior to collision, with ratios in years that followed prior to trial which, by his calculations, resulted in a total loss of past income from tradeshows of approximately $29,500. In result, the total award for past income loss under the \"complex method\" would be the same approximately $145,000 that would result from application of the \"simple method.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "73  Concerning calculations under the \"complex method\" for future loss of income earning capacity, Mr. Reynolds extrapolated additional expenses of approximately $30,000 per year because of the need to retain increased third party labour to replace his own work, arising because of his diminished capacity. Use of those amounts for a 10 year period would result in additional costs to the \"main business\" of $260,000, based upon present values of money. For a 15 year period, the loss would be approximately $360,000, and for 20 years would be approximately $430,000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "74  As to the tradeshow component of his future loss of earning capacity, Mr. Reynolds calculated additional costs of approximately $4,450 for seven shows per year (totalling $31,500 per year), required because of his incapacity to do the work on those shows as he had previously done. Based on 10 years of additional costs of tradeshows on those calculations, Mr. Reynolds would be entitled to an award of approximately $280,000, based upon the present value of money for the tradeshow component of the business. For 15 years it would be approximately $395,000, and for 20 years it would be approximately $450,000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "75  In summary therefor, Mr. Reynolds asserted entitlement to:\n",
      "an award of approximately $145,000 for past loss of earning capacity under either the \"simple\" or \"complex\" analysis;\n",
      "an award of approximately $885,000 for future loss of earning capacity based upon a \"simple\" analysis; or\n",
      "an award for future loss of income earning capacity of from approximately $530,000 to $750,000 or $880,000, depending on whether the calculation is based upon a 10, 15 or 20 year period of anticipated loss under a \"complex\" analysis\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "76  Under either analysis the future loss of capacity claim is based on a roughly equal attribution of losses to the \"main business\" and the \"tradeshow business\" of his company\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "77  Mr. Reynolds also submits that there should be no taxes or employment insurance deductions from the past loss award because it is comprised of gross expenses paid to third parties. In making that submission he relies upon Bjarnason v. Parks,  [Bjarnason], and Kilian v. Valentin,  [Kilian]\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "78  In answer to Mr. Reynolds' claims for past and future loss of earning capacity, the defendants submit that he has failed to prove that he has suffered any such losses or, alternatively, that if he has proven any loss, it is negligible\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "79  In making those arguments on behalf of the defendants, Ms. Harris submits that Mr. Reynolds' alleged losses fail to account for the fact that, notwithstanding his stated inability to work to the capacity he did before he was injured, his business has continued to grow in the period up to December 2012, for which he claims losses. She also questions why no up-to-date financial records were produced for the almost full year prior to trial and suggests that I should assume that the business continued to grow\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  Ms. Harris also submits that Mr. Reynolds' claims are based upon the erroneous assumption that the company's increased expenses in labour costs, allegedly arising from his incapacity, constitutes a valid basis upon which to quantify his purported losses. She makes the point that given the significant growth of the company's business it is not possible to attribute all of the increased labour costs to his inability to do all of the work he once did because that argument assumed that he had unlimited capacity to do more work when he was already working more than full time before the collision\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "81  Ms. Harris also submits that it is artificial to attempt to segregate the costs associated with trade shows and the drop in associated profits from those shows from the business as a whole which operates as a single business and which has continued to grow and prosper since the collision\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "82  In short, the defendants say that Mr. Reynolds has failed to prove what percentage of increased staffing would have been necessary in any event to accommodate an increase in gross sales from approximately $233,000 in the year before the collision to $253,000 in the year of the collision and ultimately to $385,000 in 2012. They say that without attribution of the increased in staffing costs to cope with growth and the labour intensive cost of production, the damages he postulates as having been suffered because of his own incapacity are without evidentiary foundation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  The defendants say that the lack of reliable evidence tendered by Mr. Reynolds concerning his alleged past loss of income earning capacity also renders his claim for future loss of capacity unproven because he has failed to establish a real and substantial possibility of a future event leading toward an income loss, as required by Perren. They submit that Mr. Reynolds is now working differently than he previously did, but with more effective use of his talents so that any assessment of loss of capacity must reflect the fact that by doing so he has been able to not only maintain but improve the business performance of his company. They accordingly say that no award for his future loss of earning capacity is warranted\n",

      "84  I agree, in part, with the submissions made by the defendants\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  Most specifically I agree with the proposition that it is artificial to attempt to separate the costs associated with alleged loss of profits from trade shows from the overall performance of the business. While it is possible to do so arithmetically, the assumptions upon which the purported separation are based are not sufficiently proven to accept that a reduction in trade show attendance has negatively impacted the overall performance of the company in the dramatic fashion now postulated by Mr. Reynolds. I am satisfied that as the astute businessman he is, if Mr. Reynolds was satisfied that attendance at more trade shows would increase the company's business to the extent that he now suggests, he would take steps to ensure participation in more shows and would, if necessary, either expend more outside resources on them or modify the extent of his own participation in other aspects of the business to allow him to devote more time to trade shows\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  I also agree that the arithmetic assertions and calculations relied upon by Mr. Reynolds in support of his \"Analysis of Business Records Complex Method\" approach to his past and future loss of earning capacity is overstated to the extent that it fails to account for the increased cost of third party labour, by way of either wages or additional subcontracting costs that would likely have been incurred in the past and will likely also be incurred in future, notwithstanding Mr. Reynolds' injuries, because of the company's increase in the sales of its product in the years after the collision\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "87  Having said all of that, however, I do not agree with the defendants' submission that Mr. Reynolds has not proven any past loss of income or has not established a real and substantial possibility of future loss of earning capacity, by reason of the injuries that he suffered due to the defendants' negligence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "88  I say that because, while the defendants' arguments criticize Mr. Reynolds' approach to the question of whether he suffered any loss, because of a failure to prove the extent to which increased costs would have been incurred in any event to account for increased growth, they also fail to recognize that Mr. Reynolds has been rendered less able to function in his work because of the debilitating nature of his injuries.\n",

He requires the assistance of others to unload such ingredients for storage and then to the area where they can be mixed. He suffers similar difficulties with shipping the product once it is ready for delivery to customers\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "90  The evidence also establishes that due to his experience with the mixing of ingredients for various products -- a time consuming and exacting task -- he is able to do that work much faster than those whom he can train to do the same work. He also is able to clean a pouring machine in 20 minutes, while those whom he has been able to train to do that task take 60 minutes. He is also able to \"multi-task\" in various job functions, which the less experienced individuals he has hired to help are unable to do\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "91  Further, due to his fatigue and the stress of doing the exacting work of mixing various very expensive ingredients, he is not able to work the same productive hours he previously worked and is unable to work as many hours as he previously did before the injury. I accept Mr. Reynolds' evidence that he is now working about one half of his pre-accident hours with output also at about 50% of that before the accident\n",

      "['50%']\n",

      "92  Also, while I do not accept that the separation of the \"trade-show\" expenses from the other expenses of the company is a reliable method by which to assess the value of Mr. Reynolds' loss of capacity, the fact remains that his inability to participate in the number of trade shows he previously did, because of the labour and other expenses now associated with them, does now and will in future make him a less valuable marketing executive than he was prior to the collision\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "93  After considering all of the evidence in this case, I have concluded that Mr. Reynolds has established a past loss of income because of the limitations on his ability to work as he previously did. While I acknowledge that the business of the company has grown, notwithstanding those limitations, the defendants' suggestion that he has suffered no loss does not account for the fact that but for the defendants' negligence, Mr. Reynolds would have been able to perform more of the work required to earn profit on his own and would also likely have been able to gain more income for the company by more participation in marketing and sales than he was able to engage in due to his limitations\n",

I find that he will, for the foreseeable future, continue to be physically disabled from heavy lifting, the loss of his ability to multi-task as he once did or replace his efficiencies and expertise in the mixing of ingredients and cleaning of machinery, as well as the fatigue and stress associated with his present condition and its impediment to productive work. His inability to participate in the number of trade shows he previously did because of the labour and other expenses now associated with such participation will, in future, continue to make him a less valuable marketing executive than he was prior to the collision\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "107  I say that because, in my opinion, the loss of future earning capacity award in this case should not be based upon an income stream analysis. It is, in my view, more appropriately assessed as the loss of capital asset with the valuation of the cost of replacement labour being considered but not arithmetically extrapolated. In my view, such a mathematical approach does not adequately reflect still unknown contingencies which may positively affect his future capacity to do more or more efficient work for the company\n",

      "108  I also reach that conclusion because I am not satisfied that the evidence as a whole supports a finding that Mr. Reynolds' disabilities will continue wholly unabated for a particular number of years. While I do not agree with the defendants' submission that the medical evidence supports a finding that his condition will be much improved in the near future, I am also not satisfied that it will continue to the end of his working life. Further, while Mr. Reynolds suggests that he had no plans to retire at 65, I am not satisfied that the evidence supports a finding that he would have continued to work at the same pace at which he worked before the collision until even age 65, had his work capacity not been impaired by his injuries\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "121  McTavish assists in the resolution of many of the issues I have identified. concerning the various issues raised by Mr. Reynolds' claims under this head of damages. More specifically:\n",
      "Huddart J.A. wrote at paras. 21-23:\n",
      "[21] As I noted earlier in these reasons, the essence of the appellants' submission with regard to future loss of housekeeping capacity is that the respondent is not entitled to pecuniary damages for the work done by others that she is unable to do as a result of the accident unless she is likely to hire replacement labour, because only then will she be seeking pecuniary damages. To the extent she herself performs the tasks with difficulty, they are to be compensated as non-pecuniary general damages, and thus subject to the overall limit.\n",
      "[22] The respondent's view is that the award quite properly reflects her reduced housekeeping capacity and the need for the provision of services by others whether or not she is required to pay for them at their reasonable value. Moreover, she views the trial judge as having made a finding of fact upon evidence that she would have hired household assistance if it were not provided by family members. In her view this finding wholly satisfies the test for recovery of compensation for future diminished housekeeping capacity if such a finding is necessary for recovery.\n",
      "[23] As I noted earlier, the majority in Kroeker chose to leave unsettled the proper approach to the assessment of a claim for loss of future housekeeping services. However, I consider they rejected the approach put forward by the appellants when they approved that taken in Fobel v. Dean  (Sask. C.A.), including this passage Gibbs J.A. quoted at para. 25:\n",
      "The trial judge properly noted and concluded that the authorities (notably Daly) establish that it was not necessary for Mrs. Fobel to prove that someone will be employed to do the work in the future in order to be entitled to an award for pecuniary loss of housekeeping capacity. ...\n",
      "She went on to say at paras. 26-29:\n",
      "[26] The difficulty, of course, in compensating the provider of unpaid services for the loss of ability to provide those services is that articulated by Taylor J.A. for the minority in Kroeker. It is not that housekeeping services do not have economic value or cannot be valued in monetary terms. It is because the capacity to do unpaid work extends far beyond housekeeping services. It includes the loss of the ability of a person to contribute his or her working capacity to others for little or no remuneration; it includes hobbies.\n",
      "[27] For such reasons, Mr. Justice Taylor would have treated the loss of housekeeping capacity as a cost of future care component, or alternatively, in all situations where the plaintiff does not spend or is not likely to spend money for replacement services, as a factor in the determination of non-pecuniary damages to the extent the plaintiff's pain and suffering or loss of amenities, as the case might be, was affected by the loss of domestic self-sufficiency.\n",
      "[28] This is a useful distinction. The opportunity cost to a service provider will often be a realistic measure of the value of lost housekeeping capacity.\n",
      "[29] If a plaintiff's claim for loss of housekeeping capacity is viewed as a need for care in the form of household services and those household services have been provided by a family member or friend in the pre-trial period, it has long been recognized that a plaintiff may recover damages for those services whether or not she pays for them. In Roach v. Yates, [1937] 3 All E.R. 442, the wife and sister-in-law of a gravely injured man, gave up paid employment in order to nurse the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought to recover as special damages an amount equal to the lost wages of the two women, and as a cost of future care, an amount equivalent to their expected loss of wages in the future. The English Court of Appeal held that he was entitled to recover the damages he claimed.\n",
      "She stated at paras. 43 and 46:\n",
      "[43] As I have noted, the majority in Kroeker quite clearly decided that a reasonable award for the loss of the capacity to do housework was appropriate whether that loss occurred before or after trial. It was, in my view, equally clear that it mattered not whether replacement services had been or would be hired. It did not adopt the analogy with future care as a general rule. Nor did it permit, nor in view of the authorities to which I have referred could it have permitted, a deduction for the contingency that replacement services might not be hired. Allowances for contingencies are for risk factors that might make the loss of capacity more or less likely.\n",
      "...\n",
      "[46] In sum, the possibility that the respondent may not hire someone to perform the household duties does not constitute a contingency of which account must be taken on the principles set down in Athey v. Leonati, , supra. A plaintiff need not prove she will hire someone to perform household tasks in order to be fully compensated for the loss of her ability to do the work herself.\n",
      "She concluded at para. 68:\n",
      "[68] In my view, when housekeeping capacity is lost, it is to be remunerated. When family members by their gratuitous labour replace costs that would otherwise be incurred or themselves incur costs, their work can be valued by a replacement cost or opportunity cost approach as the case may be. That value provides a measure of the plaintiff's loss. Like the trial judge I would prefer to characterize such compensation as general damages assessed in pecuniary terms, reserving special damages for those circumstances where the plaintiff actually spent money or incurred a monetary liability, although I do not wish to state a settled view on that question in the absence of full submissions as to the consequences of the distinction, if any\n",

They are currently sleeping in the living room as their bedroom is under construction. The spare bedroom has also been under construction as it was painted with toxic paint and so the whole ceiling has had to be removed. The restorers are working in there and he is hopeful that it will soon be finished.

      "Past losses:\n",
      " 1) House cleaning: (claim $1,667.50)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "136  I allow this claim as presented. I find the costs incurred to be reasonable and appropriate given Mr. Reynolds' post collision limitations, notwithstanding that they were incurred more than four years post collision. To the extent that they were not incurred earlier I find that he was coping as best he could without third party assistance but also without being able to do all that he would have otherwise done.\n",
      " 2) Window washing: (claim $252)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "137  I also allow this claim as presented. Again, I find the costs incurred to be reasonable and appropriate given Mr. Reynolds' post-collision limitations, notwithstanding that they were incurred more than four years after the collision. I find that his injuries limited his ability to do that work even though he engaged outside assistance only once in almost five years.\n",
      " 3)  Landscaping and yard work (including lawn mowing; spring and fall clean-up; snow removal and wood chopping: (claim $11,542.34)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "138  I will allow $6,000 as a global award in relation to the claim presented in part because I am satisfied that some of the claim as presented relates to work done by others that improved the property rather than maintained it. While it is true that the evidence establishes that Mr. Reynolds had been doing yard work and landscaping improvements on his own or with the help of family for the four years prior to the collision, it also establishes that given the many other aspects of his life requiring his time and attention the work was proceeding at a very slow pace\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "139  To the extent the property was improved, Ms. Brennan as an owner was also benefited so that the award should reflect that fact as I will later discuss\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "140  My assessment that $6,000 is an appropriate award for the claims advanced under this aspect of Mr. Reynolds' claim also reflects my concern with the reasonableness of employing different commercial service providers for lawn mowing, yard clean-up, snow removal and wood chopping in a rural community where Mr. Reynolds has been able to use corporate employees or other part-time non-commercial help to perform with those or similar tasks. It would, in my view, have been far more reasonable to obtain the services of students or part-time employees who could augment their income by the provision of casual labour to Mr. Reynolds for fair recompense nearer minimum wage rather than incur the high cost of different commercial service providers.\n",
      " 4)  Home renovations and installation of irrigations systems: (claim $22,607.25)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "141  The evidence establishes to my satisfaction that Mr. Reynolds paid $15,624.00 to third parties for the labour supplied by them to complete the inside renovations to his home that had been ongoing for some years before the collision but had come to a virtual standstill in the years following due to his post-collision loss of capacity to continue that work\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "142  The evidence also establishes that Mr. Reynolds paid or will pay $6,982.50 for the improvement of landscaping in the front and back yard, as well as the installation of irrigation systems in both the front and back yards\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "143  The costs as presented are for replacement labour only and reflect work that Mr. Reynolds would likely have been able to do -- perhaps with some familial or friendship assistance over time had he not been injured\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "144  I am not, however, satisfied that the defendants should be required to pay for the totality of those costs. While it may be arguable that the work would not have been done by Mr. Reynolds to the extent it has now been completed within the almost five years post-accident had he not been injured, I am not prepared to discount the award for that reason. There is also no proof that the end product is better than that which Mr. Reynolds would have eventually produced had he not been injured\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "145  The fact does, however, still remain that Ms. Brennan is a one-half owner of the property\n",

      "146  Similar issues were considered by Rogers J. in Pierce v. Pandhi,  [Pierce], who assessed the value of work the plaintiff would have done herself as being about three quarters of that which would be done professionally, and then reduced that amount by one half to account for the benefit accruing to her husband\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "147  While I do not apply the one-quarter reduction which Rogers J. considered appropriate in Pierce for the cost of work done by others, I do find in this case that an award of one half of that claimed by Mr. Reynolds for the improvements made is necessary to account for Ms. Brennan's ownership of the impugned property. I accordingly award $11,304 for the loss of Mr. Reynolds' ability to do the home renovations and landscaping improvements that have now been or will be done\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "148  In summary, of his claim for an award of $36,079 for past loss of homemaking capacity, I will allow a total of $19,223.50, calculated as follows: for Mr. Reynolds' loss of capacity to do house cleaning ($1,667.50); window washing ($252); landscaping and yard work including lawn mowing, spring and fall clean-up, snow removal and wood chopping ($6,000); and home and yard renovations ($11,304).\n",
      "Future losses:\n",
      " 1) House cleaning: (claim $67,200)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "149  This claim is based upon Ms. Drummond's recommendation of $4,431 per year until Mr. Reynolds reaches the age of 75. That yearly amount is based upon a payment that would be more than that paid to a private individual, presented at $25 per hour, but less than that charged by a commercial service. It is also based upon an estimate of two and one half hours per week, plus an additional 10 hours twice per year for spring and fall cleaning\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "150  That recommendation and the assumptions upon which it is based do not reflect the facts that: the $1,677.50 paid for house cleaning by Mr. Reynolds which formed the basis of his past loss of his inability to do house cleaning was the total he expended in almost five years post-accident, and at no time was an additional 20 hours per year of cleaning services used for spring and fall cleaning\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "151  While I recognize that during the years before 2013 Mr. Reynolds was either trying to cope as best he could or was simply not attending to the house cleaning he previously did, I am satisfied that the claim advanced for future house cleaning is exaggerated as to the amount of services suggested, as well as in the increased costs associated with commercial cleaning agencies\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "152  I am also satisfied that to require the defendant to pay for such services to age 75 would overcompensate Mr. Reynolds by assuming he would not have eventually required some house cleaning assistance in future in any event and fails to account for positive health improvement contingencies that may arise\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "153  I have concluded that an award of the magnitude suggested by Mr. Reynolds, based on mathematical analysis of cost projections and assumptions, and based upon less than one year in which outside services were used by him, is not supported by the evidence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "154  I am satisfied that an award of $10,000 for the loss of his housecleaning capacity will appropriately compensate him for that loss.\n",
      " 2) Window washing: (claim $7,800)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "155  This claim is again based upon Ms. Drummond's recommendations. She suggests that a twice yearly cost of between $504 and $525 to age 75 is necessary to compensate Mr. Reynolds for his loss of window washing capacity\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "156  That analysis is based upon the fact that Mr. Reynolds engaged a professional cleaning service once (in July of 2013) in the almost five years since the collision and there is no evidence to suggest that professional window washing will be needed twice per year in future\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "157  I am satisfied that the evidence as a whole does not support an independent award for Mr. Reynolds' loss of capacity to wash windows. I have included compensation for the occasional time when window washing assistance may be needed due to his injuries in my award for loss of housecleaning capacity and in the award I will make for loss of his capacity as a handyman.\n",
      " 3)  Landscaping and yard work (including lawn mowing; spring and fall clean-up; snow removal and wood chopping: (claim $61,900)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "158  Mr. Reynolds presented a claim for his future loss of capacity relating to his inability to do these aspects of required yard work based on separate cost assessments for: lawn mowing ($23,650); spring and fall yard clean-up ($13,550); snow removal ($20,700); and, firewood chopping ($4,000)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "159  As with all of his other loss of homemaking capacity claims, he relies upon recommendations and cost analyses provided by Ms. Drummond, which he suggests should be extrapolated to age 75\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "160  As I noted when reviewing Mr. Reynolds' claims for past losses concerning these same issues, I am concerned with the reasonableness of basing a claim for losses upon the purported employment of different commercial service providers for lawn mowing, yard clean-up, snow removal and wood chopping in a rural community where Mr. Reynolds has in the past been able to use corporate or part-time employees to help with those or similar tasks. In my view, the use of commercial service rates and the separation of tasks which are in reality all part of the general upkeep and maintenance of lawns, gardens and roadways serves no purpose other than to unreasonably inflate expected compensation for what are at base, tasks which do not require specialized training or equipment\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "161  As with past losses claimed under this head, I find that it would be far more reasonable to obtain the services of students or part-time employees who could augment their income by the provision of casual labour to Mr. Reynolds as needed for fair recompense. In that regard I note that he himself suggested that the cost of one person to do those things that he could not do in the operation of his business due to his injuries would be $15 per hour, not the much higher costs of commercial service providers suggested by Ms. Drummond\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "162  I am also satisfied that to require the defendants to pay for such services to age 75 would overcompensate Mr. Reynolds by assuming he would not have eventually required some yard work cleaning and other similar assistance in future in any event and fails to account for any positive health improvement contingencies that may arise\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "163  I have further determined that in many respects these claims advanced for loss of capacity to do future yard work and related maintenance greatly overlap with Mr. Reynolds' related additional claim advanced for \"loss of handyman capacity\" in the amount of $20,000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "164  Also, in many respects compensation for his diminished handyman capabilities has been made by payment for past renovation work on the home he was unable to do as well as past and future work on the irrigation systems he has installed or will be installing\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "165  I have concluded that all of Mr. Reynolds' future claims for: landscaping and other yard maintenance; lawn mowing; snow removal; chopping of firewood; and, loss of handyman capacity should be compensated as one claim for loss of capacity, not as separate claims. To do otherwise would overcompensate him for reasons I have already addressed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "166  I find that an award of $25,000, in addition to the $10,000 I have awarded for his loss of future house cleaning capacity, will appropriately compensate Mr. Reynolds for the loss of his future ability to do those outside yard tasks he was previously able to do as well as the diminishment of his general handyman capabilities\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "167  In summary, I award $35,000 for Mr. Reynolds' future loss of homemaking, yard work and handyman capacity.\n",
      " D.  Special Damages Including Claims for Uncompensated Past Cost of Care\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "168  Mr. Reynolds claims compensation for his expenditure of $7,081.47 on his past cost of care and $3,214.41 for miscellaneous expenses he says he incurred as a consequence of the defendants' negligence and the harm it caused him\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "169  The defendants did not dispute all of those claims for special damages but also did not specifically admit that any expense should be paid by them. They also question the amount of payment that should be made for some items because they were paid by Mr. Reynolds' company rather than by him personally and likely deduced as a business expense, so that a reduced amount should be paid to him for those expenditures\n",

      "[55] Generally speaking, claims for special damages are subject only to the standard of reasonableness. However, as with claims for the cost of future care (see Juraski v. Beek, ; Milina v. Bartsch  (BCSC)), when a claimed expense has been incurred in relation to treatment aimed at promotion of a plaintiff's physical or mental well-being, evidence of the medical justification for the expense is a factor in determining reasonableness. I accept the argument expressed through Dr. Frobb, that a patient may be in the best position to assess her or his subjective need for palliative therapy. I also accept the plaintiff's counsel's argument that in the circumstances of any particular case, it may be possible for a plaintiff to establish that reasonable care equates with a very high standard of care. In the words of Prof. K. Cooper-Stephenson in Personal Injury Damages in Canada, (2d ed., 1996) at p. 166:\n",
      "Even prior to the Supreme Court's endorsement of the restitution principle [in Andrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd. and Arnold v. Teno, ], in the area of special damages the courts had been prepared to allow optimum care, and damages were awarded for expenses of a character that stretched far beyond the resources of even an affluent Canadian.\n",
      "That being said, and while Dr. Frobb's paradigm of the patient becoming their own physician may have at least a superficial appeal, plaintiffs are not given carte blanche to undertake any and all therapies which they believe will make them feel good\n",

      "\n",
      "175  Saunders J.'s decision in Redl encapsulates the considerations which should bear upon the assessment of Mr. Reynolds' special damages claims in this case. When assessing special damages the standard is the reasonableness of the expense claimed in the context of the injuries suffered. Medical justification for any expense is a factor to be considered, but not the only one. Subjective factors can also be considered including whether the plaintiff believed the treatments were reasonably necessary\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "176  I am satisfied that all of the uncompensated payments made and claimed by Mr. Reynolds as special damages are generally supported by the medical evidence and were reasonably incurred by him in his search for relief from the pain and suffering and distress caused by the collision so that he could cope as well as possible with the effect of those injuries upon his life\n",

      "[28] In Andrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd.  at 462, Dickson C.J.C. said:\n",
      "In theory a claim for the cost of future care is a pecuniary claim for the amount which may reasonably be expected to be expended in putting the injured party in the position he would have been in if he had not sustained the injury. Obviously, a plaintiff who has been gravely and permanently impaired can never be put in the position he would have been in if the tort had not been committed. To this extent, restitutio in integrum is not possible. Money is a barren substitute for health and personal happiness, but to the extent, within reason, that money can be used to sustain or improve the mental or physical health of the injured person it may properly form part of a claim.\n",
      "[29] The purpose of the award for costs of future care is to restore, as best as possible with a monetary award, the injured person to the position he would have been in had the accident not occurred.\n",
      "[30] The award is \"based on what is reasonably necessary on the medical evidence to promote the mental and physical health of the plaintiff: (Milina v. Bartsch  (B.C.S.C.) and adopted in Aberdeen v. Zanatta,  at para. 41\n",

      "[32] The failure of the trial judge to perform an analysis of each item sought by the plaintiff with respect to whether there was \"some evidentiary link between the physician's assessment of pain, disability and recommended treatment and the care recommended by a qualified health professional\" was a legal error. ..\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "191  Thus, while reasonable subjective beliefs of a plaintiff in pursuing treatment that is not specifically medically recommended in seeking relief from injuries are deserving of consideration in assessing special damages (per Redl), some medical evidentiary support for future care expenditures is necessary\n",

They are also critical of her failure to engage in formal capacity testing rather than simply accepting Mr. Reynolds' assertions about his physical limitations and her failure to make inquiries of his treating physicians with respect to his future needs\n",

He would need to be provided with a king sized bed as he likes to sleep with his wife and in order to do this a king sized adjustable bed will need to be provided. I would recommend that he be provided with an appropriate mattress as this tends to provide the most comfort. Sears sells an Adjustable Sleep Set at a cost of $8,259.94 plus taxes. The mattress requires a protective cover which costs $179.94 plus taxes. This bed has a 20 year warranty and is stated to never need replacing. Delivery is free and set-up costs $20.

      "[28] Since Kroeker, it has been settled law in this province that \"housekeeping and other spousal services have economic value for which a claim by an injured party will lie even where those services are replaced gratuitously from within the family.\" In Kroeker, such recovery was allowed under the heading of 'loss of future ability to perform household tasks', but obviously, damages for loss of such ability prior to trial may also be properly claimed and recovered: see, e.g., McTavish v. MacGillivray,  at paras, 43, 51-7, per Huddart J.A.; West v. Cotton  (C.A.) at para. 25; and Campbell v. Banman 2009 BCCA.484. The reasoning in Kroeker has been extended beyond \"spousal\" services to services rendered by other members of a family: see Boren v. Vancouver Resource Society, , Dufault, , McTavish v. MacGillivray; Bystedt v. Hay, , all supra. Such awards are colloquially referred to as \"in trust\" even though it is the plaintiff who recovers them, and British Columbia courts do not generally impose trust terms in their orders, regarding the loss as that of the plaintiff: see Feng v. Graham  (C.A.) at 9-10; McTavish, supra.\n",
      "[29] The majority in Kroeker was alive to the possibility that awards for gratuitous services by family members of plaintiffs could \"unleash a flood of excessive claims\" (supra, at para. 29) and for that reason, urged courts to be cautious in making such awards. In the words of Gibbs, J.A.:\n",
      "... as the law has developed it would not be appropriate to deny to plaintiffs in this province a common law remedy available to plaintiffs in other provinces and in other common law jurisdictions. It will be the duty of trial judges and this Court to restrain awards for this type of claim to an amount of compensation commensurate with the loss. With respect to other heads of loss which are predicated upon the uncertain happening of future events measures have been devised to prevent the awards from being excessive. It would be reasonable to expect that a similar regime of reasonableness will develop in respect of the kind of claim at issue in this case. [At para. 19; emphasis added.]\n",
      "I do not read Kroeker or Ellis, , however, as establishing a threshold of \"grievousness\" in terms of the injuries which may necessitate such services. A plaintiff who has a broken arm, for example -- presumably not a \"grievous\" injury -- and who is obliged to seek assistance in performing various household tasks should not be foreclosed from recovery on this basis. This was recognized in Ellis in the quotation reproduced above. Thus I disagree with the trial judge's reference to grievous injury as a threshold that the plaintiff was required to surmount if her claim was to go to the jury. Instead, claims for gratuitous services must be carefully scrutinized, both with respect to the nature of the services -- were they simply part of the usual 'give and take' between family members, or did they go 'above and beyond' that level? -- and with respect to causation -- were the services necessitated by the plaintiff's injuries or would they have been provided in any event? Finally, if these questions -- which I would have thought are appropriate for determination by a jury -- are answered affirmatively, the amount of compensation must be commensurate with the plaintiff's loss. The assessment of such loss has been the subject of several considered judgments in this province, most notably McTavish and Bystedt, both supra.\n",

To strike, but not to dismiss, might invite an application to amend the pleadings yet again. A summary trial is scheduled for five days starting on May 7, 2012 and the plaintiffs' position is that that summary trial should be heard on the current pleadings, except for any claims that have been dismissed. The majority defendants respond by saying that they have been waiting for these reasons before bringing an application to amend, since any such application should be made in light of the outcome of this application\n",
      "======\n",

      "7  The application is for summary judgment under Rules 9-6(2), (3) and (5) of the Rules of Court. The plaintiffs also rely on Rule 9-5. The proposition advanced by the plaintiffs is that the claims they attack are bound to fail; there is no genuine issue for trial. The pleadings have either not pleaded the material facts necessary to support a defence or claim, or there is no evidence capable of giving rise to a genuine issue for trial. In respect of the claim in negligence, the argument is that it is both plain and obvious that the pleadings disclose no reasonable defence and there is no evidence capable of giving rise to a genuine issue for trial\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "8  The majority defendants are candid in acknowledging that they have struggled to articulate the precise legal foundation of their defence. However, they say that, as a practical matter, it is obvious that if they are correct about the facts they do have a defence or the right to raise a set-off against the plaintiffs' claim. The difficulty in pleading their defence, they say, arises because of the highly unusual legal framework underlying the relations between the parties. Nonetheless, there is no real dispute about the material facts defining the issues between the parties. They say that if they are right about the facts the result is clear, even though articulating the legal foundation of that result may be difficult\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "10  To appreciate the nature of this application and its implications for the litigation as a whole, it is necessary to provide some background to explain how we got here from there. Before doing so, some preliminary observations may be helpful. In approaching this application I am guided by a number of important considerations. I accept the critical role of pleadings in defining the issues between the parties and laying the foundation for identifying material facts, but I am conscious of the risk of diverting the parties into an unproductive and endless process of amendment if what is in issue is, as a practical matter, plain to see. I recognize that the Rules are intended to facilitate the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of disputes on the merits and not to frustrate adjudication on the merits: see Rule 1-3. I also respect the admonition not to \"litigate in slices\". As I have made clear in earlier rulings in this litigation, I am wary of making rulings on the pleadings or on an application for summary judgment on particular issues that might have unintended substantive consequences for what all parties appear to recognize are the real factual questions in dispute, however they are legally characterised\n",

      "11  The purpose of the summary judgment rule has recently been helpfully analyzed by Mr. Justice Savage in Haghdust v. British Columbia Lottery Corporation, , leave to appeal to BCCA refused, , in the context of a motion for judgment brought by a defendant at paras. 13-18:\n",
      "[13] Rule 9-6, under which this application is made, is the successor under the Supreme Court Civil Rules, B.C. Reg. 168/2009 to the old Rule 18. BCLC relies on subsections 9-6(4) and 9-6(5) which read as follows:\n",
      "Application by answering party\n",
      "In an action, an answering party may, after serving a responding pleading on a claiming party, apply under this rule for judgment dismissing all or part of a claim in the claiming party's originating pleading.\n",
      "Power of court\n",
      "On hearing an application under subrule (2) or (4), the court,\n",
      "if satisfied that there is no genuine issue for trial with respect to a claim or defence, must pronounce judgment or dismiss the claim accordingly,\n",
      "if satisfied that the only genuine issue is the amount to which the claiming party is entitled, may order a trial of that issue or pronounce judgment with a reference or an accounting to determine the amount,\n",
      "if satisfied that the only genuine issue is a question of law, may determine the question and pronounce judgment accordingly, and\n",
      "may make any other order it considers will further the object of these Supreme Court Civil Rules.\n",
      "[14] The underlying purpose of the summary judgment procedure has been described as preventing claims (or defences) \"...that have no chance of success from proceeding to trial\" because \"[t]rying unmeritorious claims imposes a heavy price in terms of time and cost on the parties to the litigation and on the justice system\": Canada (Attorney General) v. Lameman,  at para. 10.\n",
      "[15] The Rule provides that if a Court is \"satisfied that there is no genuine issue for trial with respect to a claim or defence\", the Court \"must pronounce judgment or dismiss the claim accordingly: Rule 9-6(5)(a). In my view, this standard, that there is \"no genuine issue for trial\" is no different than the \"bona fide triable issue\" standard under the old rule. Thus, for a claim to be dismissed on a summary judgment application, it must be manifestly clear that there is no matter to be tried: Progressive Construction Ltd. v. Newton (1981), 25 B.C.L.R. 330 (S.C.).\n",
      "[16] BCLC also relies on Rule 9-6(5)(c) which provides that if \"satisfied that the only genuine issue is a question of law, [the Court] may determine the question and pronounce judgment accordingly\". Rule 9-6(5)(c) did not have any comparable section in the old Rule 18. In L.D. (Guardian ad litem of) v. Provincial Health Services Authority,  Sewell J. suggested caution in approaching this new provision (para. 19). He opined that a court should decide an issue of law only if satisfied that [t]here is no real dispute about the material facts and the issue of law is \"well settled by authoritative jurisprudence\" (para. 20). Further, the Summary Trial Rule, \"Rule 9-7 is better suited for deciding novel points of law because on a summary trial, the Court will have a more complete record framing the question of law\" (para. 20). Neither party before me raised an issue with regards to this reasoning.\n",
      "[17] Rule 9-6(5)(c) also limits determinations of questions of law to certain circumstances. That is, the court may only make determinations on questions of law where it would allow the court \"to pronounce judgment accordingly\". In the context of Rule 9-6(4), where the application is to dismiss \"all or part of the claim\", this means that determination of the question of law must allow the court to pronounce judgment on at least part of the claim. Of course, an application for summary judgment seeks a final order: Forest Glen Wood Products Ltd. v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), . Since an application for summary judgment seeks a final order, it would be wrong or at least premature to decide a question of law that did not lead to that result pursuant to this provision.\n",
      "[18] It seems, then, that jurisdiction under Rule 9-6(5)(c) is intended to allow the court to determine on a summary basis whether there is a genuine question of law standing between the plaintiff's claim and judgment: See Canada (Attorney General) v. Lameman, at para. 10, Leclair v. Ontario (Attorney General) , aff'd, . Where the state of the law is clear, and there is a straightforward answer to a legal question that will allow the court to dispose of the claim and thus protect its processes from abuse by unmeritorious claims and defences, then the court may answer the question. It does not confer a broad discretion to determine issues of law that might otherwise be germane to a proceeding falling short of allowing the court to pronounce judgment on all or part of a claim: See Provincial Health Authority, at para. 20\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "12  Rule 9-5 incorporates what was previously Rule 19(24). The purpose of that rule is similar to the summary judgment rule. It is to prevent claims going forward to trial or defences being raised where it is \"plain and obvious\" that they do not constitute causes of action or defences known to law: see Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "13  In the context of this case, an order dismissing a defence under the summary judgment rule or as disclosing no reasonable defence will not bring the litigation to an end. It will not obviously lead to a judgment on part or all of a claim. At most, such an order will narrow and limit the issues for trial in the sense that it would remove from the trial certain legal theories that are in substance alternative foundations for judgment on part or the entire claim. It is also far from clear what effect such an order will have in narrowing or limiting the scope of discovery or the evidence at trial, as opposed to the scope of the legal argument arising from the evidence. In other words, it is not obvious that dismissing defences at this stage will achieve substantial reductions in discovery, factual investigation or the evidence at trial. To the extent that there is a discretionary element in my decision whether to accede to this application, the absence of a clear basis to conclude that granting the orders will materially save time and expense militates against granting them, especially where the risks of \"litigating in slices\" may materialize.\n",

      "14  This case is at root what is colloquially referred to as a \"leaky condo\" case involving six multi-unit buildings in Richmond, known as Sussex Square. Water damage was discovered in 2009 and repair work was undertaken to deal with the problem at a cost of about $2.4 million by the plaintiff, Westsea, which, inter alia, manages the buildings\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "15  The plaintiffs sought to recover the cost of repairs from the leaseholders, sublessees or assignees of the units in the buildings by relying on the contractual obligations of the \"owners\" to pay operating expenses and a special assessment. They say that their claim is essentially one sounding in debt\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  The leaseholders have resisted payment. They say that the plaintiffs, including Westsea, breached their obligations to maintain the building and to ensure that a sufficient contingency fund was available to pay for repairing the building. In the alternative, the plaintiffs acted unreasonably in the way they conducted the repairs\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  Lurking in the background is liability for further repairs (sometimes referred to as phase 2) costing in excess of $7 million, although no claim has yet been advanced against the leaseholders for those costs. The majority defendants say that some of the work in phase 2 addressed problems arising from the way phase 1 was conducted and, therefore, what is properly owing for phase 1 cannot be determined without considering what was or is to be done in phase 2. In essence, however, the leaseholders say that if Westsea was in breach of its obligations or acted negligently in discharging them, then they must have a defence to payment. It is that simple\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  The plaintiffs' case is that they fulfilled all of their obligations. They are entitled to payment, under the leases, and the majority defendants have wrongfully refused to pay. They are in default under the relevant leases and, accordingly, the plaintiffs are entitled to terminate them and take possession of the units. They also suggest that a cause of the damage that needed to be repaired lay in the failure of the leaseholders to fulfil their obligation to maintain balconies and windows, thereby allowing water ingress. They submit that the rights and obligations of the parties are defined by written agreements, a series of leases, to which they are party. Those agreements create express rights and obligations that exhaust the legal relationship between the parties and there is no proper basis to allege either implied contractual terms or legal duties arising in negligence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  In argument, both sides accepted that the legal rights of the parties emanate primarily from the contracts between them. They disagreed, however, about whether there is any possible room for terms to be implied into those contracts, whether and how obligations or defences may be transferred as the leases were assigned or subleased and assigned, and what role negligent maintenance might play in the litigation.\n",
      "The Legal Framewor\n",
      "======\n",

      "20  The express rights between the parties are defined by a series of leases, assigned leases, subleases and assigned subleases. They are defined in the Amended Notice of Civil Claim as the Lease, the Modified Lease, the Sublease Assignment and Re-Assignment Contracts. Throughout these reasons I will often refer to the lease or leases or contracts as a shorthand and convenient way to refer to the complex web of leases at issue in the litigation. Since the relations between the parties have been created by leases it will be apparent that this case does not involve a strata corporation\n",
      "======\n",

      "21  Originally the plaintiff, Capital Construction, held legal title to the land and buildings in trust for the plaintiff, Westsea Construction. In 1984, Westsea and Capital entered into a 99 year lease with Sussex. At the same time, Westsea, Capital and Sussex entered into a management agreement under which Sussex, as the lessee, appointed Westsea to manage, control and administer Sussex Square\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "22  The 1984 lease defined the respective obligations of the lessors and the lessee respecting the maintenance of Sussex Square. Those obligations identified who was responsible for maintaining different aspects of the building, payment for maintenance performed by Westsea and the establishment of a contingency fund for payment of unusual or extraordinary future expenses\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "23  In brief, and at the risk of oversimplification, what happened was that Sussex's leasehold interest in individual units was transferred to individual purchasers by way of subleases or assignments. Those subleases and assignments have in many instances been sold and resold by the sublessees and assignees. The \"majority defendants\" are leaseholders in Sussex Square\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  Again, at the risk of oversimplification, the burden of the obligations undertaken by Sussex, as lessee, in the lease respecting the maintenance of some aspects of the building (for example, balconies and windows) and payment of expenses were transferred to the leaseholders\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "25  It is clear from further submissions by the parties that they do not agree about the legal effect of the transfers of the leases on the rights and obligations of the parties in this litigation. It is uncertain, in my view, whether the transfers of the leases also transferred all rights and obligations along the chain so that a later leaseholder would always be able to raise any claim or defence arising out of a breach of the lease, for example by or attributable to the lessor, occurring before that leaseholder acquired the lease\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  The answer to those questions may depend on whether there is a continuing privity of contract along the chain, which in turn may depend on the nature of the instruments achieving the transfer (assignment versus sublease versus assignment of sublease). It likely also depends on the concept of \"privity of estate\" and which obligations run with the land and whether certain kinds of breaches may be regarded as continuing breaches or not\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  In my view, a summary judgment proceeding is not an adequate forum in which to resolve these difficult questions. They should be resolved, to the extent that it turns out to be necessary, at a summary trial or trial. I refer to these issues here because in my view, as will be seen, they bear, at least, on the analysis of the availability of a negligence claim giving rise to a set-off\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  The express terms of the lease require leaseholders to pay monthly operating expenses as estimated and assessed by the lessors (in this case typically Capital and Westsea). Operating expenses include amounts paid or payable by the lessors in connection with the \"maintenance, repair, operation, ... management and administration of the Land and Buildings ... and all other expenses paid or payable by the Lessor in connection with the Land and Building and includes a Contingency Reserve Fund\". If estimated operating expenses are insufficient to pay actual operating expenses, the lease contemplates the levying of, in effect, a special assessment. Default in paying operating expenses gives rise to a right to terminate the lease\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  The express terms of the lease also include the obligation of leaseholders to repair and maintain the suites at Sussex Square, including doors, windows and balconies. The interpretation of that obligation as it affects the majority defendants is contentious. Under the lease, the leaseholders also have a right to elect a management board having the power and duty to advise and make recommendations to the lessors on their duties and responsibilities referable to maintenance and repair and the incurring and collection of operating expenses\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  The plaintiffs allege that the leaseholders are in breach of their obligations by refusing to pay the assessed monthly operating expenses and have caused or contributed to the damage that needed to be repaired by failing, in a number of cases, properly to maintain the windows and balconies, thereby permitting water ingress\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  Under the lease, the lessors covenanted to provide quiet enjoyment and to keep in good repair and condition the foundations, outer walls, roofs, spouts and gutters of the building and all common areas. The lease also provides for a contingency reserve fund to be held by the lessors in an amount of not less than 5% of the total annual budget, until the reserve reached an amount that the lessors, in their reasonable opinion, considered sufficient having regard to the type of building and, thereafter, such further amount as the lessors, in their reasonable opinion saw fit. The lessors agreed to exercise prudent and reasonable discretion in incurring operating expenses consistent with their duties as defined in the lease\n",

      "['5%']\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "32  The majority defendants argue that the plaintiffs did not fulfil their obligations under the lease because they failed properly to maintain the building over time, failed to establish an adequate contingency reserve fund and incurred unreasonable costs during the first phase of the repair work. These facts sound as breaches of express or implied terms of the lease or as breaches of a duty of care in negligence. Furthermore, the leaseholders say that the second phase of repair is, in part, rectifying inadequacies of the first phase. Accordingly, their obligations under the lease to pay \"operating expenses\" associated with the first phase of repair cannot be assessed without having regard to the second phase\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "33  In an application of this kind I am not engaged in weighing evidence. It should be noted, however, that the majority defendants have put before the court a preliminary expert report that tends to support their position that water damage has been caused by the failure properly to maintain what may be referred to as the building envelope (an obligation arguably falling on the lessors) over time. If that is accurate, it is to be expected that those failures occurred at times when some of the majority defendants did not have a leasehold interest. It should be noted, moreover, that the report also identifies a failure to maintain windows and balconies as one source of water ingress\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  I refer to this evidence because it supports the proposition that there is a genuine issue for trial rooted in facts to do with how the building was damaged, when it was damaged, what was necessary to repair it and whether more repairs are now needed than otherwise would have been the case if the building had been differently maintained. The plaintiffs say, however, that nothing in this report is evidence that any failure to maintain the buildings has led to a dangerous condition or that any property damage arises from a defect. Both of these considerations bear on whether any claim for negligent maintenance can be sustained in the context of a claim for set-off rooted in pure economic loss.\n",

      "35  It became apparent during the course of submissions that the parties misunderstood each other's legal position in one important respect. The majority defendants denied critical aspects of the express terms of the leases in their Amended Response to Notice of Civil Claim, even though elsewhere in the pleading they refer to terms of those leases. The plaintiffs, understandably, took this to mean that the majority defendants were pleading that a contract different to the express leases governed the relations between the parties. A large part of their application was directed to striking out that different contract\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  Mr. Logan, on behalf of the majority defendants, made it clear that if the pleadings denied the express terms of the contract, then a mistake had been made. He agreed that the principal foundation of the legal relationship between the parties was to be found in the express terms of the leases, although those express terms do not exhaust the legal relationship between the parties. It would be helpful to have any ambiguity on this matter removed by an appropriate amendment to the pleadings\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  I take it, from the submissions made in court, that it is now common ground that the starting point for defining the respective rights and obligations of the parties is the express language of the applicable leases. Insofar as the relations between the parties are governed by contract, that contract is found in the leases pleaded in the Amended Notice of Civil Claim\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  I am satisfied that the majority defendants have pleaded a breach of the express terms of the leases as a foundation of their right to resist payment of the operating expenses. I therefore dismiss the plaintiffs' application that the claim for breach of contract must be struck and dismissed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  There remains, however, disagreement about whether the leases may include implied terms relevant to the disposition of the case and whether concurrent duties in tort may exist alongside, and concurrent with, the express contractual relationship. The majority defendants argue that the existence of the leases does not necessarily oust duties owed in negligence and if those duties were breached, then losses incurred by the majority defendants may give rise to a right of set-off against the claim for operating expenses.\n",
      "Implied term\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "40  The majority defendants plead a number of implied terms. These include that Westsea and Sussex would institute and administer a prudent and reasonable maintenance program for Sussex Square consistent with its obligations to maintain Sussex Square including the following: periodic inspection to evaluate the ability of Sussex Square to withstand water ingress, keeping up to date with developments in good work practices for maintaining building envelopes, appointing expert consultants to advise on optimal strategies for economically prolonging the service life of Sussex Square, acting prudently and reasonably when incurring operating expenses and limiting the entitlement to recover operating expenses to an amount that would have been expended had they acted prudently and reasonably in maintaining Sussex Square and incurring operating expenses. It is said that without transparency in the process of incurring unusual or extraordinary expenses, Sussex, or assignees or sublessees, if any, of Sussex's rights under the lease, would not be able to assess the lessors' compliance with their contractual obligations\n",
      "======\n",

      "\n",
      "42  The majority defendants have also advised the court that they intend to apply to amend further their pleadings dealing with implied terms in order to clarify the contractual relationships and to make clear that they are relying on the implication of terms based on the legal incidents of a particular class or kind of contract (i.e. the leases)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "43  The plaintiffs have mounted what the majority defendants acknowledged to be a powerful case that the alleged terms cannot be implied into the contract. That argument is based on several propositions. First, as pleaded by the majority defendants, the terms are not necessary to give the express contracts \"business efficacy\". Secondly, some of the implied terms contradict express terms of the leases or are the subject matter of express terms of the leases. Thirdly, it is argued that no facts are pleaded to establish that it is obvious that the implied terms would have been agreed to by Sussex, Westsea and Capital at the time the lease was entered into. In particular, the majority defendants were not parties to the lease when it was entered, the head lessors are not solely responsible for performing maintenance and transparency is not an issue for related companies. The plaintiffs argue that the alleged implied terms are not obvious, necessary or reasonable, and the written contract documents set out all necessary terms. The thrust of the argument is that no terms are to be implied into the leases in the face of their express terms and, in any event, not the specific implied terms alleged by the majority defendants\n",

Equally, I am not satisfied that the issue whether implied terms may exist is a matter of law capable of resolution independently of the matrix of facts that give rise to it. What Savage J. had to say in Haghdust is helpful in relation to this aspect of the application for summary judgment:\n",
      "[32] I have summarized here, in very brief form, one line of argument relating to this part of the Plaintiffs' application. It concerns the enforceability and applicability of the VSE Rules as it relates to these Plaintiffs and the referenced statutory provisions. In determining whether there is a genuine issue for trial under Rule 9-6(5)(a), the court, if it concludes there is no genuine issue for trial, has no discretion. It must pronounce judgment or dismiss the claim.\n",
      "[33] In considering whether the only genuine issue for trial is a question of law under Rule 9-6(5)(c), the court retains a residual discretion. Surely that is the plain meaning of the use of the term \"may\" in the phrase \"may determine the question and pronounce judgment accordingly\". If, for example, it is the [court's] view that the legal analysis would benefit from a more fulsome record regarding the context of the events, the court retains a residual discretion under Rule 9-6(5)(c) to decline to determine the question, but may, where appropriate, make other orders under Rule 9-6(5)(d). While the matters raised here are in large part legal issues, this case is one of first impression, and the precise questions raised contain factual components and legal issues that are not, in my view, \"well settled by authoritative jurisprudence\" and thus \"bound to fail\".\n",
      "[34] I have not specifically referenced all of the Plaintiffs' arguments, which oppose the defendant's application, but it seems to me that, because of the wording of Rule 9-6(5)(c), I should not do so if the legal answers are not dispositive of an issue allowing the court to pronounce judgment.\n",
      "[35] In other words, even if I were of the view that three of those four arguments are without merit, if one argument is not \"bound to fail\", I should refrain from providing what is in effect a declaratory opinion with respect to the others. That would invite \"litigation by instalments\", which is to be discouraged: See Banks Industrial Supply Ltd. v. Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Ltd., , and Garland v.

One is that, if the question of law is answered in one way, it will be decisive of the litigation or a substantial issue raised in it.

Suffice to say first that the situation arising in this case is unusual. It involves contracts entered into by parties who are not at arm's length, but who at the time contemplated transferring rights and obligations to unrelated parties in the future or who soon after entering the contracts decided to do so. The express terms are stated in rather general and non-specific language. It is not obvious to me that some aspects of those terms might not be \"fleshed out\" or supplemented by implied terms necessary to support or give business efficacy to the express obligation\n",

      "48  Accordingly, I am not satisfied that there is no genuine issue for trial on the question whether any implied terms could exist. Having reached that conclusion, I do not think it appropriate to venture into an analysis of the specifics of the alleged implied terms. Precisely which implied terms might survive an analysis of the relevant evidence is unclear. I say that acknowledging the principle that where an obligation is dealt with expressly or where an alleged implied term contradicts the express terms of the contract, implied terms cannot survive. Here, part of the difficulty is that whether the express term does cover and exhaust the obligation or contradict the implied term needs to be assessed in a more developed factual matrix\n",

It would be unwise, in my view, to strike and dismiss the paragraphs dealing with implied terms at this stage in the proceeding. Doing so is fraught with the risks attendant on \"litigating in slices\". This is not a case where a summary determination would bring the litigation to an end, remove contractual issues entirely from the litigation or allow judgment to be pronounced on part or the entire claim as that language should be understood in the context of this rule. Regardless of the disposition of this aspect of the application, the litigation will proceed and the issues will primarily be focused on the obligations arising as a result of the express language of the leases. Discovery is not yet complete. The full factual matrix that may be relevant to the interpretation of the express terms of the leases is not before me. Having reviewed the leases, the exact meaning of the express terms and what they may require in any specific context is not clear beyond cavil. For example, it is not clear to me, at this stage at least, how the lessees' obligation to maintain windows and balconies meshes with the lessors' obligation to maintain what, arguably, may amount to the building envelope. I am not prepared to conclude at this stage, with only the leases before me and only a general understanding of the facts, that there are no ambiguities in the leases. If there are, extrinsic evidence may be necessary to determine common intentions\n",

Alternatively, some of the implied terms may do no more than capture means by which the lessors could act so as to ensure that they fulfilled their express contractual obligations. The failure to follow the practice described as an implied term (i.e. failing to institute a reasonable inspection programme) may be the reason why the express terms of the contract were breached, if they were (a proposition about which I currently have no view). On the other hand, it may be that none of this bears on the question whether as an objective fact the leases have been breached. It is, however, too early to prejudge any of these questions\n",

Again, in my view, it would be unwise to dispose of such questions at this stage given the potential consequences of doing so for the issues that un-controversially remain to be litigated. All of these issues should be decided at the same time, namely at a trial\n",

The question whether there may be implied terms is inextricably connected to the true nature of the contractual rights and obligations of the parties. It is not a distinct and different legal claim with a different conceptual foundation, as is the case, for example, with the claim in negligence\n",

The majority defendants plead that the plaintiffs' owed a duty of care prudently and reasonably to maintain Sussex Square, institute and administer a prudent and reasonable maintenance programme for Sussex Square, act prudently and reasonably when incurring operating expenses and adequately maintain the contingency reserve fund. The duty to administer a reasonable maintenance programme includes periodic inspections, keeping up to date with developments in good work practices for maintaining building envelopes, appointing expert consultants to advise on strategies for prolonging the life of Sussex Square and keeping up to date with regulations affecting buildings like Sussex Square\n",

Presumably, breach would also support a remedy connected to the cost of repair.

      "65  The law recognizes that concurrent duties may exist in contract and tort and that proximity may arise from a nexus between parties created by contract. The starting point of the analysis remains BG Checo International Ltd. v. British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, . In that case, an obligation in tort (negligent misstatement) was identical to the contractual obligation. The issue was whether the duties in negligence and contract could exist concurrently. The majority of the Supreme Court concluded they could. The basic rule was stated as follows at para. 15:\n",
      "... where a given wrong prima facie supports an action in contract and in tort, the party may sue in either or both, except where the contract indicates that the parties intended to limit or negative the right to sue in tort. ... The mere fact that the parties have dealt with a matter expressly in their contract does not mean that they intended to exclude the right to sue in tort. It all depends on how they have dealt with it\n",

Thus, the principle of the primacy of private ordering is respected at para. 16. Moreover, there is no necessary inference to be drawn from the fact that the contractual obligation may perfectly correspond to the duty in negligence that the parties thereby intended to oust their tort obligations at para. 25; see also the discussion of the authorities beginning at para. 29\n",

      "\n",
      "68  I take the following from the majority discussions of concurrency of tort and contract in BG Checo. First, one must be able to identify a tort duty that exists independently of the specific contractual duty in the sense that the tort and the contract duties co-exist, in principle, concurrently. In other words, the existence of the alleged tort duty cannot arise solely and exclusively out of the contract. Secondly, the existence of the contract may be a source of the proximity between the parties that gives rise to the alleged duty in tort. Thirdly, the existence of the tort duty will need to be justified in accordance with the ordinary rules in negligence for recognition of duties. In other words, to establish potential concurrency of duties a plaintiff (or in this case, the defendants) will need to point to an established category where a tort duty has been recognised or justify a \"novel\" claim in accordance with the Anns test. Fourthly, if potential concurrency exists, in order to avoid a duty in tort, the defendant (or in this case, the plaintiffs) would have to show that the parties have structured their relationship through the contract in such a way that the existence of the tort duty is eliminated or modified. It must be shown that the parties intended to extinguish tort liability through the contract. Generally, this will require express language, although it may arise by necessary implication. It is not to be assumed that the existence of contractual obligations, even if they correspond exactly to the tort duties, evidences an intention to extinguish the tort duties\n",

      "69  In the context of the issue before me, these questions need to be analyzed first through the lens of the \"plain and obvious\" test. Hence, specifically, the question is whether it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs could not owe the majority defendants duties in negligence given that they maintain the buildings and given that the defendants allege they have not done so \"properly\" and their failure to do so has led to damage to the structure of the building, including damage giving rise to safety and health concerns. Accordingly, the second critical question is, could these, admittedly broadly characterised circumstances give rise to a duty in negligence? The third question is whether, in the context of a summary judgment application, there is any evidence capable of raising a genuine issue for trial\n",

In the first instance, the alleged duty does not fall within any category in which a duty has been recognized.

Further, the alleged claim cannot satisfy the Anns test\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  In relation to the negligent provision of a service, the plaintiffs argue that it is a necessary condition of the existence of such a duty that there is a direct gratuitous undertaking to perform a service for the benefit of a claimant or a claimant relies to its detriment on the negligent performance of a contract by the party said to owe the duty with a third party\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "72  The negligent provision of shoddy goods or structures is ruled out as a foundation of the duty because that category of the duty requires that a defendant has designed or constructed a building containing a defect that poses a \"real and substantial\" danger. Negligent maintenance does not provide a foundation for this category of duty. It is argued that maintenance failures are not a defect and cannot cause a defect. Defects are inherent in the building from the time of construction resulting from the materials, construction or design of the building\n",

      "74  It is important, in my view, to recognize the practical circumstances in which this allegation arises. First, if there has been a failure to maintain, it is not yet clear when that failure occurred. Secondly, it is clear that leaseholders have traded their units in Sussex Square over many years. Some or many of the leaseholders may not have held their interest at the time of the alleged breach. Those leaseholders, at least, did not have a contractual relationship with the plaintiffs at the time of the conduct alleged to cause damage. They acquired their interests subsequent to the conduct that would allegedly be a breach of contract by the plaintiffs with those defendants who held their units at the material time. Arguably, those post breach defendants may not be able to rely on a breach of contract since they were not party to the contract at the material time. Thirdly, the alleged breaches are said to have given rise to damage to the structure of the building, as well as causing problems of mould, which, one may infer, could pose a risk to health\n",

      "75  For the following reasons I have concluded that the plaintiffs have not met the test of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue for trial concerning whether a duty of care could not arise between the plaintiffs and the majority defendants that sounds in economic loss and arises from a negligent failure to maintain the building\n",

      "\n",
      "76  In my view, at least two critical factors weigh against the plaintiffs' argument\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "77  First, in their supplementary submissions in response to my memorandum to counsel, the plaintiffs made it clear that their position was that a leaseholder who acquired an interest at a time after a breach of the lease by the plaintiffs could not raise that breach as a defence to the plaintiffs' claim in debt for payment of operating expenses. In my view, that position, if it is correct, makes this case similar to categories of cases in which recovery for pure economic loss has been recognised. On the plaintiffs' own analysis, those cases involve pure economic loss suffered by \"C\" as a result of a breach of duty (for example, contract) by \"A\" that was owed to \"B\". This structure of relationships underlies, according to the plaintiffs, all cases of negligent provision of a service and relational economic loss. Here, on the plaintiffs' analysis, a current leaseholder of a unit \"C\" may have suffered economic loss because the plaintiffs \"A\" breached their duty to a previous leaseholder of that unit \"B\". If that is so, the current facts may well be analogous to categories of cases in which a duty has been recognised\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "78  Secondly, the plaintiffs argue that this case must fall outside the Winnipeg Condominium line of cases because, among other reasons, there is no evidence on the summary judgment application that the alleged failure to maintain the building has caused a dangerous condition. In particular, the expert report put before the court by the majority defendants does not allege danger\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "79  I am unable to accede to that argument. The expert report does allege structural damage, including rot, and problems with mould. In my view, that evidence may be sufficient to lay a foundation for a genuine issue at trial about whether that damage rises to the level of posing a danger. Structural damage may well risk danger and mould is known to risk human health. Hence, even if I accept the plaintiffs' position that the cause of action recognised in Winnipeg Condominium requires danger, there is, in my view, a genuine issue for trial on this point\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Winnipeg Condominium is instructive. The specific issue in Winnipeg Condominium was stated by the Court as follows at para. 1:\n",
      "[1] ... May a general contractor responsible for the construction of a building be held tortiously liable for negligence to a subsequent purchaser of the building, who is not in contractual privity with the contractor, for the cost of repairing defects in the building arising out of negligence in its construction\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "81  The Court found this to be \"the opportunity once again to address the question of recoverability in tort for economic loss\", in this case in relation to negligent supply of shoddy goods or structures at para. 12. The Court held that, in principle, liability could arise for the cost of repairs in the circumstances, if the defect in question was a dangerous defect. The Court left open the question, subsequently answered in the negative according to the plaintiffs, whether contractors should also be held to owe a duty to subsequent purchasers for the cost of repairing non-dangerous defects in buildings at para. 41. The Court acknowledged that some other jurisdictions have \"recognized some form of general duty of builders and contractors to subsequent purchasers with regard to the reasonable fitness and habitability of a building\" at para. 41\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "82  In reaching its conclusion that in the circumstances before it a duty of care could arise, the Court rejected an argument that recognizing such a duty would have the effect of creating a non-contractual warranty of fitness. It also rejected an argument that the potential duty of care should be negated by the principle of caveat emptor: see paras. 45-46, 51-53. Both of these arguments were advanced to me to support the proposition that no duty of care could arise in the circumstances of this case. The Supreme Court of Canada appears to take a different view of matter\n",

      "83  The Court considered whether it should adopt the same approach to recovery as had been endorsed in the United Kingdom by the House of Lords. In departing from that approach, La Forest J., speaking for the Court, observed that the approach of the House of Lords rested in part on the assumption that liability in tort for the cost of repair of defective houses represented an unjustifiable intrusion of tort into the contractual sphere. The Canadian position is different. The duty of care in tort may arise co-extensively with a contractual duty\n",
      "======\n",

      "84  At para. 25, the Court made the following important comment:\n",
      "[25] ...The duty in contract with respect to materials and workmanship flows from the terms of the contract between the contractor and the homeowner. By contrast, the duty in tort with respect to materials and workmanship flows from the contractor's duty to ensure that the building meets a reasonable and safe standard of construction. For my part, I have little difficulty in accepting a distinction between these duties. The duty in tort extends only to reasonable standards of safe construction and the bounds of that duty are not defined by reference to the original contract. Certainly, for example, a contractor who enters into a contract with the original [homeowner] for the use of high-grade materials or special ornamental features in the construction of the building will not be held liable to subsequent purchasers if the building does not meet these special contractual standards. However, such a contract cannot absolve the contractor from the duty in tort to subsequent owners to construct the building according to reasonable standards. ..\n",

Such leaseholders may not have a claim sounding in contract if that is the case. If this were to be the case, leaseholders who have acquired their interests post-breach would appear to be in an analogous position to the purchaser in Winnipeg Condominium. The resolutions of these issues may depend on the evidence\n",

The plaintiffs say, however, that a failure to maintain cannot give rise to a defect because a defect must be inherent in the building from the time of its construction.

Suppose the new cladding contained defects that rendered it unsafe. Later, but before the defect had become manifest, the building is sold. Would a subsequent purchaser of the building be denied recovery of the cost of repair because the problem arose from a maintenance programme and had not been inherent in the building from the time of its construction or design?

      "90  I recognize, also, the complication in this case that the title to the building remains with a plaintiff and the leaseholders own leasehold interests. It is not plain and obvious that that fact must take the case outside the principles in Winnipeg Condominium or the other possible bases for recognising a tort duty. This is not a pleadings matter. Leasehold interests are a form of property interest and the evidence needs to be developed before it can be concluded safely that the damage alleged is not damage to property of the leaseholders or is otherwise not recoverable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "91  One last question remains. This question has to do with a circumstance in which the conduct alleged to cause the damage occurs at a time when there is privity of contract between the plaintiffs and a defendant. Is it a requirement of the existence of duty in tort that there be no privity of contract between the parties\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "92  I do not read Winnipeg Condominium as requiring an absence of privity of contract as a necessary condition for the existence of the duty in tort. It is well-established that tort and contractual duties may exist concurrently. The passage from para. 25 of Winnipeg Condominium quoted above contemplates a duty arising with respect to workmanship and materials to ensure that the building maintains reasonable and safe standards of construction. That duty can arise concurrently with the contractual obligation. I can see nothing that prevents it arising and being owed concurrently to the party to the contract. The effect of the BG Checo case is that one would have to find terms in the contract that extinguished the concurrent tort duties before the contract ousted those duties\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "93  I do not think that whether the relevant contracts here oust the tort duty could be decided as a pleadings matter or as a matter of law in the context of a summary judgment application\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "94  It follows, therefore, that even if I were completely satisfied that subsequent leaseholders could rely on earlier breaches of the contract, and the necessary privity of contract had been preserved as interests have been transferred, I would not conclude that no genuine issue for trial arises on the question whether a duty in tort to maintain the building could arise. I would not strike the claim in negligence on that basis\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "95  It is not necessary to move on to consider whether it is plain and obvious that the alleged tort duties could not satisfy the Anns test. I will, however, make a limited comment. The plaintiffs relied on the following two Supreme Court of Canada cases suggesting that where parties have ordered their affairs by contract, the imposition of tort duties covering the same subject matter is not advisable. In Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd., , the Court explained the rationale for this approach saying at para. 15:\n",
      "[15] ... There are compelling reasons for this. Contractual obligations are voluntarily assumed by parties and given effect to by the courts. The failure to perform certain promised positive contractual obligations in contract law is conceptually distinct from the breach of unpromised negative obligations to not harm another's interests in tort law ... [Citations omitted.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "96  Mr. Justice Rothstein, writing for the Court, in Design Services Ltd. v. Canada, , made a similar point in concluding that the existence of a contract could be a policy reason negating the existence of a duty of care. He said at para. 56:\n",
      "[56] ... To conclude that an action in tort is appropriate when commercial parties have deliberately arranged their affairs in contract would be to allow for an unjustifiable encroachment of tort law into the realm of contract\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "97  The first case, Hamilton, is not directly applicable to the circumstances before me since it dealt with the approach to assessing damages for breach of contract where there are alternative modes of performance. Design Services is more relevant. It is not clear, however, how that case is to be read in light of earlier pronouncements of the Court. It may signal something of a retreat by the Court in the area of recovery for pure economic loss. However, the case dealt with sophisticated commercial parties who had the opportunity to create a joint venture. The alleged tort duties were said to arise in the face of a negotiated relationship between the parties. This is a far cry from the current situation which does not involve, at least on the leaseholders' part, sophisticated commercial parties negotiating over the particular structure of legal obligations to which they will be subject. The case, moreover, does not purport to overrule Winnipeg Condominium or the other Supreme Court of Canada cases on which I have based my analysis\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "98  One final observation should be made. The Winnipeg Condominium line of cases deals with recovery of the cost of repairs. It does not deal with the loss of the economic value of the building. I have serious reservations about the characterization of the damage to the majority defendants being a loss of value of the units. Whether that loss may be recoverable as a result of relational economic loss or negligent performance of the service may be another matter. That question, however, may be left to trial\n",

I am aware that Mr. Logan submitted that in the nature of this case it is unlikely that particulars of specific times of alleged breaches could be given. I take it that that submission turns of the continuing nature of the alleged breaches over many years and the corresponding difficulty in point to specific events at particular times.

      "101  As I understand the argument, it is said that none of these defendants could have a defence to payment of the full amount assessed by the plaintiffs. In each case, the transfer involved a re-assignment of the lease; a transaction involving the assignor, the assignee and Capital as the lessors. The assignor assigned to the assignee the assignor's interest in the suite subject to the payment by the assignee of operating expenses. The assignee also covenanted to pay all monies and perform each of the lessee's (Sussex Square) agreements with respect to the suites.

      "104  I was not taken to any language in the agreements that compel that result. I was not shown any language that expressly stipulates that notice to an assignee of an amount claimed before an assignment constitutes agreement by the assignee to pay that amount, even if it were not owing by the assignor. I was not shown anything that excluded the legal possibility that the assignee merely assumed the obligation to pay of the assignor, whatever that might be. The assignee may have accepted the obligation to pay whatever is properly due and owing and not more. If that is so, these particular defendants are in no different position to that of the other defendants despite the timing of their acquisition of their interests\n",

I am not prepared to resolve this issue at a summary trial on a pleadings basis or on the basis of the limited factual record currently before me. These claims should be dealt with in the context of a full factual record where the trier of fact is in a proper position to resolve the legal issues relating to the legal implications of interests being transferred\n",

At the time of the accident, Ms. Yick was sitting in the front passenger seat of a car being driven by her husband, the defendant Martin Li. They were on their way to a dinner out. At approximately 6 p.m. Mr. Li entered the intersection of Lougheed Highway and Dewdney Trunk Road in Coquitlam.

Mr. Johnson was employed by Mr. Falk and was driving the Truck in the course of Mr. Falk's business, Hazelmere Roofing, with Mr. Falk's permission. At the time of the accident.

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "4  Ms. Yick has no recollection of the events immediately preceding the accident. Mr. Li testified that on October 21, he and his wife were driving from their home in Port Coquitlam to a restaurant in Port Moody. He testified that they had left their home approximately five minutes prior to arriving at the intersection, which is a major intersection controlled by traffic lights\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "5  Mr. Li testified that as he approached the intersection from the east on Dewdney Trunk Road, the light for westbound traffic on Dewdney Trunk Road changed from green to amber. He was approximately one to two car lengths from the intersection when the light turned amber. He testified that he took a quick look in his rear-view mirror and saw that there were no cars behind him so he was able to stop his vehicle and wait for the next green cycle of the lights\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "6  Mr. Li stated that when the light for traffic on Dewdney Trunk Road turned green, he checked to his right and left and then proceeded to slowly accelerate through the intersection. He said that he also did a quick check to his right at about the mid-point of the northbound lane on Lougheed Highway but did not observe any apparent danger. Mr. Li then proceeded through the intersection until he reached a point between the curb and centre through southbound lanes of the Lougheed Highway\n",
      "======\n",

      "7  Mr. Li testified that when he reached that point, he became aware of the Truck but was only able to turn his head thirty degrees before there was an impact. Mr. Li momentarily lost consciousness. His next recollection is of waking up in the vehicle which had come to a rest at the southwest corner of the intersection. At that point, Mr. Li became aware that Ms. Yick was unconscious. He called out to her but was unable to revive her. Within minutes assistance arrived and Mr. Li was assisted in getting out of his vehicle\n",

He testified that as he approached the intersection of Dewdney Trunk and Lougheed, he observed the GMC Tracker being driven by Mr. Li proceed into the intersection on the green light and slowly accelerate through the intersection. Mr. Crocket testified that the light was green for westbound traffic on Dewdney Trunk Road as he approached the intersection and saw the GMC Tracker, which was two vehicles in front of him, proceed into the intersection\n",

      "11  Mr. Crocket said that he then observed a Ford F250 pickup proceeding southbound on Lougheed enter the intersection. At the time the Truck entered the intersection, the light was green for traffic on Dewdney Trunk Road. Mr. Crocket testified that on observing the Truck enter the intersection against the light, he brought his vehicle to a stop. He testified that he did not hear the squealing of any tires or the sound of any brakes being applied. In his own words, he said that the drive of the Truck did not seem to notice that there was an intersection. He said that he saw the Truck strike the passenger side of the Tracker\n",

      "13  Mr. Sam Safaei testified that he was driving a vehicle that was stopped at the red light in the southbound left turn lane on Lougheed Highway waiting for the light to turn green to allow him to make a left hand turn onto Dewdney Trunk Road. Mr. Safaei testified that it was overcast, that there was still some light, it was not raining and that the visibility was good. He testifies that the light was red for all three lanes of southbound traffic on Lougheed Highway while he was waiting. Mr. Safaei says that while he was waiting, he noticed a light coloured pickup truck pass him and proceed into the intersection in the curb southbound lane. He says that the red light at that point had been on for some seven to ten seconds. He estimated the speed of the Truck at between 50-70 kilometres per hour. He says that he did not hear any noise such as the sound of a car braking or tires skidding. In his evidence he was quite definite that the Truck entered the intersection against a red light. Mr. Safaei also testified that the collision between the Truck and the GMC Tracker occurred quite quickly, he estimates in one or two seconds after he saw the Truck. He was unable to see any brake lights go on on any of the vehicles\n",

      "14  Mr. Johnson gave a markedly different version of what occurred. Mr. Johnson testified that he was driving the Truck southbound on the Lougheed Highway. As he approached the intersection of Dewdney Trunk Road he had the green light. However, just as he was about to enter the intersection the light changed from green to amber. Mr. Johnson says that he decided it was safer to proceed through the intersection than come to a sudden stop. He says he entered the intersection on the amber light and was proceeding through when he suddenly noticed the GMC Tracker approaching him from his left. He says he swerved to try to avoid a collision but did not have time to do so. In his evidence he characterized what happened as the Tracker hitting his vehicle. He stated that the Tracker appeared to be going at a high rate of speed and \"gunning it\" to clear the intersection\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "15  I do not accept Mr. Johnson's evidence as to what occurred at the time of the accident. I prefer the evidence of the two independent witnesses that Mr. Johnson entered the intersection against a red light at a speed approximating the posted speed limit on the Lougheed Highway. I find it likely that Mr. Johnson was distracted by trying to find a route to return to Surrey and that he simply did not notice that he was proceeding against a red light\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  In addition to the direct conflict between his evidence and that of the two independent witnesses, I found Mr. Johnson to be a somewhat unsatisfactory witness. His memory of what occurred at the time of the accident was vague. While I can appreciate that some considerable time has elapsed between the accident and the trial, I found it remarkable that Mr. Johnson had a vague recollection of so many things about the accident, but was able to give definite evidence that he entered the intersection just as the light turned to amber, and that it was Mr. Li's vehicle that struck his truck. His evidence that he attempted to swerve is not supported by the points of impact: the front of his truck and the passenger side door of Mr. Li's. In addition, I find that his evidence that the GMC was \"gunning it to clear the intersection\" is contradictory to his evidence that the light for Lougheed traffic was green as he approached the intersection and turned yellow just as he entered the intersection\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  On the other hand I found the evidence of the independent witnesses to be honest and reliable. Both were well placed to observe what happened and gave definite evidence that Mr. Johnson's Truck ran a red light. Their evidence is consistent with that of Mr. Li that he waited for a green light before entering the intersection\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  I therefore conclude that Mr. Johnson proceeded through the intersection against the red light at a speed of 50 to 70 kilometres per hour and that his truck hit Mr. Li's vehicle broadside on the passenger side door\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  Given these findings of fact, there is no doubt that Mr. Li had the right of way at the time of the collision. This, of course, is not determinative of liability and in particular does not preclude a finding that Mr. Li was negligent and that that negligence was a cause of the accident\n",

      "20  The weight of authority has established that a driver of a vehicle lawfully proceeding through a green light at an intersection has only a very limited duty of care to drivers who unlawfully proceed on a red. In Wong v. West, ,  [Wong], the Court of Appeal stated the law as follows at 527-528:\n",
      "The sole question to be determined on this appeal then is whether or not the learned judge below was in error in finding the appellant to have been negligent. In my view he, in any event, placed too great a burden upon the appellant when he said, \"A prudent driver would have been careful not to pass a car in that position unless he was certain that nothing was going to appear from behind it into his path.\" (My italics). The duty of the appellant was to exercise due care and the question is whether or not under the circumstances here he failed to do so. In my view, having the green light with him, travelling on a six-lane marked street he was entitled to proceed as he did and should not have been found negligent. He owed no duty to traffic entering the intersection in disobedience to the lights, beyond a duty that, if he in fact saw such traffic, he ought to take all reasonable steps to avoid a collision. See Joseph Eva Ltd. v. Reeves [1938] 2 KB 393, 107 LJKB 569, [1938] 2 All ER 115, referred to with approval by the Supreme Court of Canada in Mathieson v. Thompson (sub nom. Johnston National Storage v. Mathieson) , reversing . See particularly Cartwright, J. where at p. 614 he said:\n",
      "\"As was pointed out by Scott, L.J. in Joseph Eva Ltd. v. Reeves [supra] at p. 405, all traffic regulation has two main purposes, the first to insure safety and the second to promote the free circulation of traffic. To hold that the driver of a vehicle on a through highway who is proceeding on his right-hand side of the centre line of the road and at a reasonable rate of speed must, on approaching an intersection where his view to the left is obstructed, proceed on the theory that a driver may emerge from his left into his path in total disregard of the statutory rule would tend towards the paralysis of traffic rather than to the promotion of its free circulation.\n",

Not only do such provisions inform the assessment of whether a pedestrian was contributorily negligent by failing to yield a right of way, they can also help determine whether a driver breached the applicable standard of care in the circumstances. In this case, even though Johnathan's contributory negligence had been ruled out as a matter of law, the statutory right-of-way provisions continued to inform the standard of care that Mr. Feener owed to all pedestrians. The jury needed to be told that, absent special circumstances, where the driver has the right of way, he or she can reasonably proceed on the assumption that others will follow the rules of the road and yield the right of way to drivers\n",

She relies on the fact that Mr. Crockett observed the Truck going through the red light from a position at approximately the cross walk at the eastern end of the intersection. She also relies on Mr. Li's evidence that he looked to his right when he was half way across the intersection but saw nothing\n",

I do not think that the fact that Mr. Crockett saw the Truck proceed through the red light from his vantage point necessarily means that Mr. Li either saw, or should have been aware that the Truck posed a threat. No party called any expert evidence with respect to Mr. Li's opportunity to avoid a collision even if he had been aware that the Truck was running the red light. There was no evidence as to the relative position of the vehicles when each entered the intersection, and in particular, how far the Truck would have been from the intersection when Mr. Li looked to his right\n",

In particular I find that Mr. Li did not observe Mr. Johnson's truck at any time within which he could have taken any steps to avoid the collision. There was not sufficient evidence to lead me to conclude that he could, by the exercise of reasonable care, have become aware that Mr. Johnson was going to enter the intersection in sufficient time for him to take any steps to avoid the collision\n",

No surgical intervention was undertaken with respect to her orthopedic injuries\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "33  Ms. Yick was originally transferred from the ICU to a surgical ward at Royal Columbian Hospital. After approximately one month she was transferred to Eagle Ridge Hospital for rehabilitation. She was discharged from Eagle Ridge Hospital on December 22, 2006, some two months after the date of the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  After being discharged from Eagle Ridge Hospital, Ms. Yick gradually recovered from her orthopedic and soft tissue injuries. For a time she required the use of a cane to assist her with walking. However, eventually Ms. Yick was able to walk without the assistance of any walking devices. The headaches that she initially experienced gradually resolved themselves. At the present time she no longer suffers from an unusual frequency of headaches\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  Her fractured ribs and pelvic fractures healed well within 6-12 months of the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  Unfortunately Ms. Yick has suffered very significant consequences from the severe traumatic brain injury. In addition, the third cranial nerve damage on her right side had a significant impact on the use of her right eye and has resulted in permanent double vision. This impairment has resulted in Ms. Yick experiencing significant difficulty in reading\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  Ms. Yick has suffered permanent cognitive impairment in the domains of memory, attention, speed of information processing and, executive skills\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  Ms. Yick's personality has also been dramatically changed as a result of the accident due to trauma to her frontal lobes and its consequent impact on her executive functioning. She has demonstrated impulsive behaviour and, in particular, is prone to lashing out and outbursts of anger directed towards other individuals, including her husband and members of her own family. She has also become much more talkative and unpredictable since the accident. These behaviour characteristics have undoubtedly alienated many of her former friends and acquaintances, and together with her other cognitive impairments, have contributed to increased isolation on her part\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  All of the medical experts are agreed that there is no prospect of there being any improvement in Ms. Yick's neurological deficits, although she may achieve some further functional improvements through occupational therapy\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "40  Up to the accident, Ms. Yick was an effective, well adjusted and successful individual. She and her husband lived together in a house in Port Coquitlam. They married in the early 1990s after Ms. Yick emigrated from Hong Kong to join Mr. Li in Canada. They had no children but did have two pet cats, one of which has since died. By all accounts their marriage was a happy one\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "41  For approximately ten years prior to the accident, Ms. Yick worked as a bookkeeper and kept track of the inventory for D.C. Computer Hospital Inc., a business operated in partnership by her husband and others. Although no income tax returns were put into evidence there was evidence that Ms. Yick was paid as an independent contractor and filed her returns on that basis. At the time of the accident she was earning $2,000 per month\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "42  Ms. Yick completed high school in Hong Kong. After completing high school, she took courses in accounting and worked for various employers as a bookkeeper\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "43  Prior to the accident Ms. Yick was well liked by her friends. She had a circle of friends consisting mainly of fellow members of her church and members of both her husband's and her own extended families. She was also taking advanced ESL courses at night school and had formed friendships with some of her fellow students. All witnesses who testified about her pre-accident personality described her as quiet, polite and cooperative. She was active in her church, assisting her husband teach Sunday School and was a full-time member of the church choir. She enjoyed playing table tennis and tennis. Meals out with family and friends formed an important part of her social activities prior to the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "44  She also attended to most of the household chores, although her husband did provide some homemaking assistance to her. She cooked all of the family meals, although the couple often ate out as both were employed full time in the family business. She assisted her husband, who was primarily in charge of looking after the garden and yard. She also was largely in charge of keeping track of the family finances\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "45  There is no dispute that the accident has resulted in a profound change in Ms. Yick's intellectual and cognitive ability as well as her personality. Medical experts all agree that Ms. Yick has suffered a severe traumatic brain injury which has caused these personality and cognitive changes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "46  On the cognitive side, Dr. Gabriel Hirsh, a psychiatrist called by the defendants, commented in his report as follows:\n",
      "As a result of the severe traumatic brain injury, Mrs. Yick has been left with permanent cognitive impairments as demonstrated on neuropsychology testing. In addition, her personality has changed. She has demonstrated impulsive behaviour, but predominantly her behaviours have been characterised by lack of drive and motivation, indicative of front lobe dysfunction.\n",
      "Mrs. Yick lacks executive function including planning, organisation, sequencing and self-monitoring. Her ability to problem solve is compromised. Her mental processing speed is diminished and she manifests slowness of thought.\n",
      "These cognitive and behavioural changes have arisen from her brain injury. Mrs. Yick's ongoing activity limitation and restricted participation in life roles that would have been normal for her before the accident, reflect the cognitive impairments and personality changes pertaining to the severe traumatic brain injury she sustained in the subject motor vehicle accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "47  Dr. Samuel Yip is a neurologist whose opinion was tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. Dr. Yip was of the opinion that Ms. Yick's short term memory has been impaired as a result of the motor vehicle accident, and that impairment is likely to be permanent. In addition to the short term memory impairment, the medical experts are agreed that Ms. Yick suffers from significant executive and cognitive dysfunction as a result of the accident. Executive function is mainly dependent upon the frontal lobe of the brain. Executive function includes the cognitive ability to plan, initiate, execute and regulate behaviour. It is also responsible for motivation and self-monitoring of efficiency and effectiveness of past performance. Ms. Yick has suffered very significant impairment in these areas as a direct result of the severe traumatic brain injury that she suffered in the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  I accept Dr. Yip's opinion that Ms. Yick continues to demonstrate executive dysfunctions, lack of mental flexibility and difficulties in multitasking. She also lacks motivation as a direct consequence of her executive dysfunction, which is in turn due to her bi-frontal lobe contusions. What Dr. Yip describes as personality changes include anger outbursts, clinical lack of motivation or \"abulia\" and slow thought processing or \"bradythrenia\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "49  All of these conditions are directly attributable to the severe traumatic brain injury suffered by Ms. Yick in the motor vehicle accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "50  These injuries have had a profound effect on Ms. Yick's life. They have rendered her unemployable. They have made her largely dependent on others for all but personal care and basic household tasks. Her behavioral and personality changes have to a large extent isolated her from the social circle that she had prior to the accident and have severely limited her ability to make new friends\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "51  My conclusion that Ms. Yick is competitively unemployable is based on the opinion of Mr. Derek Nordin, as well as the evidence of Mr. Li and other co-workers who observed Ms. Yick's several attempts to return to work after the accident. The co-workers testified that Ms. Yick was unable to keep track of the accounting for the company. In addition there was evidence of difficulties that she had with customers and co-workers arising out of Ms. Yick's lack of self control\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "52  Ms. Yick is independent in matters of personal care. She is also capable of preparing simple meals for herself and her husband, although it takes her a considerable amount of time to prepare dinners. I accept Mr. Li's evidence that it takes her about three hours to prepare such meals. She is capable of and does prepare her own lunches, but these often have a high degree of pre-preparation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "53  I find that Ms. Yick is not able to look after the house. She does do the laundry for herself and her husband but neglects house cleaning and organization. An example of her difficulties in homemaking relates to the strategy she used to discourage the family cats from jumping up on furniture. Ms. Yick put household items on the chairs and furniture so that there was no place for the cats to jump up. This however resulted in an extremely cluttered and untidy house. In addition, Ms. Yick leaves cooking utensils and ingredients out of cupboards because she would otherwise have difficulty finding them. The description of the family home given by Ms. Alison McLean in her August 21, 2009 occupational therapy report illustrates the chaos and disorganization in the family home\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "54  Ms. Yick does not leave the house on her own. There is some dispute about the reason for this that I will deal with when I consider the claim for cost of future care. However it is clear that Ms. Yick does not leave home unless she is accompanied by another person. She is not capable of operating a motor vehicle because of her cognitive problems which are aggravated by her double vision. Mr. Li testified that he does not think Ms. Yick could safely use public transportation given her difficulties with problem solving\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "55  Ms. Yick does participate in a number of activities. An elderly friend takes her to a Bible study group on Thursday mornings. Another friend takes her to line dancing classes on Saturdays. Although she is no longer a regular choir member she does sing with a group once a month at church. She and her husband do attend church services on Sundays. In addition her husband takes her out for lunches, and less frequently, for dinners in restaurants. Her husband and other family and church members also take Ms. Yick shopping at nearby shopping malls. Ms. Yick is able to participate in these activities and does find them enjoyable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "56  These activities however, occupy only a small percentage of her time. Much of her waking hours are spent alone in the family home. There she spends much time playing card games on the computer. In addition, as outlined above, she spends a good deal of time preparing meals. Although Ms. Yick can read both English and Cantonese, she finds it difficult to do so given her vision problems. I also have no doubt that her cognitive and concentration difficulties are an impediment to reading as a recreational activity for her\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "57  Mr. Li stated that Ms. Yick does enjoy going on cruises. He stated that cruising was well suited to Ms. Yick's needs because there is predictable routine on board a cruise ship, that Ms. Yick had ready access to their state room to rest and that a cruise ship of course provided a controlled and limited environment. Once Ms. Yick recovered from her physical and orthopedic injuries, the couple went on a number of cruises and organized bus group tours. These trips were usually done with a group of friends from the church. Mr. Li testified that travelling in such a group made it easier to make sure that Ms. Yick did not wander off because the whole group can help to keep watch over her\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "58  I need not refer in detail to the other medical reports. A remarkable feature of this case is the broad degree of consensus among the physicians who have provided opinions. This consensus includes broad agreement that Ms. Yick is competitively unemployable and will require some assistance for the rest of her life in order to enable her to maximize her remaining abilities\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "59  I find that as a direct result of the injuries that Ms. Yick suffered in the motor vehicle accident, she has lost the ability to be competitively employed and the ability to operate a motor vehicle. In addition, as a result of her compromised executive function, I am satisfied that Ms. Yick could not live independently. At present, her husband Mr. Li is providing considerable assistance to her. With the benefit of this assistance, Ms. Yick is able to live at home, albeit at a significantly impaired level from her pre-accident condition\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "60  Before turning to an assessment of non-pecuniary damages I wish to make some observations about the evidence in this case. I start by saying that I found Mr. Li to be a credible and reliable witness. I reject the defendant's submission that he exaggerated the extent of Ms. Yick's difficulties. Mr. Li is Ms. Yick's husband and to a large extent her support worker. He must deal on a daily basis with her well documented executive and cognitive difficulties. If anything, I found his description of her difficulties to be restrained and conservative when considered in the context of the medical evidence and the observations of Ms. McLean at the family residence. The clear impression I got from Mr. Li's evidence was that he was reticent to criticize his wife's behaviour and abilities. I therefore consider him to be a reliable and restrained source of information about Ms. Yick\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "61  In this case I have also taken into account the limitations on Ms. Yick as a reliable reporter of her own condition. Those limitations are addressed in medical reports from Dr. Kaushansky dated November 21, 2011 and Dr. Zoffmann dated October 27, 2011. In his report, Dr. Kaushansky states as follows:\n",
      "With regard to her ability to withstand the rigors of a long trial, I believe that Mrs. Yick would become anxious, easily taxed and her responses on the stand may not be accurate or reliable, given her weak cognitive skills, including poor memory and diminished insight (with probable unintended confabulation) and her wish to please\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "62  Dr. Zoffmann described Ms. Yick as follows:\n",
      "Mrs. Yick shows that she has trouble retaining information that is important and relevant about her finances and the current legal proceedings. She becomes impatient and cannot tolerate being interviewed for more than an hour. This restlessness is also described by her husband. The interview process showed that she could not retain important information about the purpose of the interview for more than 10 to 15 minutes.\n",
      "She is quite confused as to the roles of the various people managing her affairs. She thought that I would be in control of her lawyer. She thought that Mr. Lam would be her financial manager and that I and a psychologist would be managing her finances as well.\n",
      "She has memory lapses and fills in the gaps with what she thin[k]s is appropriate. She does not seem to carry information forward and both of these characteristics are problematic when one thin[k]s of the need to instruct counsel during trial, testifying at trial and being able to listen to what witnesses say and remember so as to compare the information with what is already known/remembered.\n",
      "Her short attention span and her fatigability will pose significant problems for the orderly conduct of a trial. I understand that she displayed this [behaviour] at the mediation process as well - having to leave the room repeatedly due to impatience and restlessness\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  In considering Ms. Yick's capabilities and limitations, I therefore think it is more useful to consider the evidence of others, including her husband, than to rely on Ms. Yick's own assessment. I am satisfied that she lacks insight into her own limitations and deficits. I conclude that Ms. Yick's lack of insight causes her to overestimate her abilities, underestimate her limitations, and to fail to appreciate the impact that her behavioural outbursts have had on her relationships with others.\n",
      "Non-Pecuniary Damage\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  I find that Ms. Yick has been profoundly affected by the injuries she suffered in the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "65  Prior to the accident, Ms. Yick's life revolved around work, her relationship with her husband, her family and her church\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "66  Before the accident, Ms. Yick worked a regular work week at the computer repair business owned in part by her husband. Her workmates described her as friendly, competent and reliable. As a result of the accident she is no longer employable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "67  Similarly, before the accident Ms. Yick was responsible for most of the household tasks in the home she shared with her husband. She also managed the family's finances and did most of the shopping for the household. She assisted her husband with his parents by arranging meals out with them. I accept Mr. Li's evidence that Ms. Yick did a capable job of managing all those tasks. However after the accident, Ms. Yick is no longer capable of managing many of these tasks. I am satisfied that she is able to continue to live independently only through the assistance of her husband, other members of her church and her sister\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  She still does prepare the evening meals for her husband and herself but requires a very long time to do so. It is apparent from the evidence of Mr. Li, and the observations of Ms. McLean, that she can no longer manage to run the household or independently do the family shopping. She cannot manage the finances of the family\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "69  Ms. Yick's relationship with her family has also suffered as a result of the accident. Before the accident she visited her family in Hong Kong on regular basis. She was able to travel to Hong Kong on her own. However since the accident, she has developed problems with one of her sisters. On the one occasion when she traveled to Hong Kong without her husband, she had an incident in which she bit that sister, which required Mr. Li to travel to Hong Kong to bring her home. Before the accident Ms. Yick regularly had meals out with Mr. Li's parents but no longer does so\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "70  Ms. Yick's role in the church has also been significantly impacted by her injuries. Before the accident she was a regular member of the church choir and assisted her husband in teaching Sunday school. She now sings only once a month in church with a small group of singers. She does not teach Sunday school. Ms. Yick does participate in a weekly bible study class even though that class is usually open only to Sunday school teachers. She does enjoy this activity. A friend and fellow church member, Dr. Wong, picks her up and drives her to the class. Occasionally she has lunch with Dr. Wong and his wife after the class and sometimes they go shopping\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  Dr. Wong described in his evidence how he and his wife keep watch over Ms. Yick when she is shopping to make sure that she is safe. I am also satisfied that she is able to attend the bible study class only through the assistance of Dr. Wong\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "72  On Saturdays, Ms. Yick does attend line dancing classes. She testified that she enjoys these classes. She is driven to these classes by a friend, Sui Ling Lam, and is picked up afterwards by her husband who takes her out for lunch\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "73  Since the accident, Ms. Yick and Mr. Li have taken several overseas trips. They went on an organized tour of Europe, followed by an ocean cruise. They also took a long trip to China and a cruise to Australia. In addition, they have visited Ms. Yick's ailing mother in Hong Kong\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "74  As I have already indicated, Mr. Li finds cruising to work well for Ms. Yick because she is in a controlled environment and is able to have a set routine. However when she leaves the ship, she requires supervision to prevent her from wandering off\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "75  The principles applicable to an award of non-pecuniary damages are well established\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "76  In Stapley v. Hejslet, , the Court summarized the considerations that may be taken into account in assessing non-pecuniary damages. At paragraphs 45-46 Kirkpatrick J.A. set out those considerations as follows:\n",
      "[45] Before embarking on that task, I think it is instructive to reiterate the underlying purpose of non-pecuniary damages. Much, of course, has been said about this topic. However, given the not-infrequent inclination by lawyers and judges to compare only injuries, the following passage from Lindal v. Lindal, supra, at 637 is a helpful reminder:\n",
      "Thus the amount of an award for non-pecuniary damage should not depend alone upon the seriousness of the injury but upon its ability to ameliorate the condition of the victim considering his or her particular situation. It therefore will not follow that in considering what part of the maximum should be awarded the gravity of the injury alone will be determinative. An appreciation of the individual's loss is the key and the \"need for solace will not necessarily correlate with the seriousness of the injury\" (Cooper-Stephenson and Saunders, Personal Injury Damages in Canada (1981), at p. 373). In dealing with an award of this nature it will be impossible to develop a \"tariff\". An award will vary in each case \"to meet the specific circumstances of the individual case\" (Thornton at p. 284 of S.C.R.).\n",
      "[Emphasis added.]\n",
      "[46] The inexhaustive list of common factors cited in Boyd that influence an award of non-pecuniary damages includes:\n",
      "age of the plaintiff;\n",
      "nature of the injury;\n",
      "severity and duration of pain;\n",
      "disability;\n",
      "emotional suffering; and\n",
      "loss or impairment of life;\n",
      "I would add the following factors, although they may arguably be subsumed in the above list:\n",
      "impairment of family, marital and social relationships;\n",
      "impairment of physical and mental abilities;\n",
      "loss of lifestyle; and\n",
      "the plaintiff's stoicism (as a factor that should not, generally speaking, penalize the plaintiff: Giang v. Clayton, , )\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "77  These considerations are of course not intended to be exhaustive. In each case the award must meet the specific circumstances of the plaintiff. I will however review some of these considerations in these reasons\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "78  Ms. Yick was born in 1961 and was 45 years old at the time of the accident. As of June 2011, Dr. Elliot was of the opinion that the injuries she suffered in the accident had reduced her life expectancy by 4.3 years, as compared to the general population of her cohort, and by 8 years if Ms. Yick's superior pre-accident health is taken into account. Even after the accident Ms. Yick's life expectancy as of June 2011 was 29.6 years. There is in this case both a significant reduction in Ms. Yick's life expectancy and a reasonably long period in which she will have to endure the consequences of the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "79  It is also obvious that Ms. Yick suffered grievous injuries in the accident. These have already been outlined in these reasons. While the traumatic brain injury is the most serious long term consequence of the accident, the other injuries were also serious. In addition to her orthopaedic injuries, Ms. Yick has suffered a very significant loss of function of her right eye\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  Ms. Yick did not testify to ongoing severe pain. However it is apparent from the injuries that she suffered that she must have suffered considerable pain for some period of time after the accident. I am also mindful of the comments made about Ms. Yick's ability to accurately describe her conditions in this regard. I do note however that Ms. Yick does not appear to suffer from ongoing debilitating pain\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "81  It is also obvious that Ms. Yick has suffered from an extensive disability as a result of her injuries. She has a marked degree of cognitive deficits, rendering her unemployable and unable to operate a motor vehicle. In addition, she is not able to leave her home without the assistance of others because she cannot cope with the planning and executive requirements of as simple a trip as going to shops on public transportation. There seems to be agreement among the experts that Ms. Yick will require some form of personal assistance to resume even minimal involvement in the community outside of her home. To paraphrase Dr. Hirsch, she will need someone to act as her frontal lobes. Ms. Yick's ability to read has been significantly affected by the combined effect of her eye injury and her cognitive impairment\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "82  I also find that there has been a profound degradation of Ms. Yick's quality of life since the accident. Before the accident she had a fulfilling occupation, considerable independence and an active social life centered on the church and extended family. She is now limited to a few activities a week and spends long periods of time alone at home. It is also apparent that many activities that she formerly carried out without difficulty are now a significant challenge for her. For example, it now takes her three hours to prepare a simple evening meal. Her lifestyle before the accident was focused on home, work and the church. The fact that this was not particularly extravagant or luxurious did not make it any less fulfilling or important to her. Those aspects of her lifestyle that were the sources of her self esteem are now denied to her\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  Counsel for the Johnson Defendants submitted that the evidence shows that Ms. Yick now enjoys a reasonable quality of life. She pointed to the weekly activities in which Ms. Yick engages, the holiday trips and the fact that Ms. Yick is able to attend to her personal care needs and perform basic homemaking tasks. She also stressed that Ms. Yick does not have significant residual pain from her injuries\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  I do not agree with this characterization of Ms. Li's quality of life. Her life is now devoid of purpose. She is isolated in her home for most of the week. She has made no new friends since the accident. I would not characterize this as a reasonable quality of life\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  In her written submissions, the Johnson Defendants' counsel referred me to a number of cases in which the plaintiffs had suffered traumatic brain injuries resulting in significant cognitive impairment and submitted that an appropriate range of non-pecuniary damages would be between $175,000 and $200,000. In argument, she amended her submissions to a range of $200,000 to $220,000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  Plaintiff's counsel submitted that an award of $300,000 for non-pecuniary damages was appropriate in this case. He referred to the decision of Fisher J., in O'Connell v. Yung,  [O'Connell], in which damages of $275,000 were awarded for a brain injured plaintiff. I note that on appeal, reported at , the court described that award as being at the high end of the appropriate range for such cases. Counsel also referred to Campbell v. Swetland, , in which damages were agreed at $290,000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "87  I will not refer to all of the cases cited by the Johnson Defendants' counsel. However, I am of the view that Ms. Yick's injuries are more severe than most of the cases she relied upon\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "88  In Eggleston v. Watson, , the plaintiff was found to have suffered a mild traumatic brain injury even though there was no loss of consciousness. His other injuries were significantly less serious than those suffered by Ms. Yick. He was able to work. The extent of his cognitive impairment was significantly less than that of Ms. Yick. He was awarded non-pecuniary damages of $170,000.00\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",

The trial judge decided that he suffered persisting, but very mild sequelae affecting cognition from a mild traumatic brain injury. He was awarded $180,000 ($194,000 in 2012 dollars) for non-pecuniary damages. The extent of Ms. Yick's cognitive and executive impairment is far greater than that of Mr. Kean\n",

However his other injuries were less severe than those suffered by Ms. Yick. He was able to drive a car, something that Ms. Yick cannot do.

      "Pain and suffering and loss of amenities are intangibles. They are not possessions that have an objective, ascertainable value. Professor Kahn-Freund in his brilliant essay \"Expectation of Happiness\" (1941), 5 Modern L. Rev. 81 [at p. 86], cites the example of the Stoic philosopher Poseidonios, who, when tormented by pain, is reported to have exclaimed: \"Pain, thou shalt not defeat me. I shall never admit that thou art an evil.\" How, Professor Kahn-Freund asks, could we award damages for pain and suffering to this philosopher who welcomed his misery as a test of his own power to resist it? Is the Stoic entitled to less compensation than the weak-willed person who recoils at the slightest suggestion of pain or unhappiness? These examples only reinforce the conclusion that it is fruitless to attempt to put a dollar value on the loss of a faculty in the way that we put a dollar value on the loss of a piece of property.\n",
      "These problems were identified and discussed by the Court in the trilogy. In Andrews, three theoretical approaches to the problem of non-pecuniary loss were canvassed. The first two approaches, the 'conceptual', which treats each faculty as a proprietary asset with an objective value, and the 'personal', which would measure loss in terms of human happiness of the particular individual, both seek, in varying ways, to place a dollar value on human faculties and human happiness. The Court adopted the third approach, the 'functional', which rather than attempting to set a value on lost happiness, attempts to assess the compensation required to provide the injured person with reasonable solace for his misfortune. Money is awarded, not because lost faculties have a dollar value, but because money can be used to substitute other enjoyments and pleasures for those that have been lost. The matter is discussed in Andrews in these terms at p. 262:\n",
      "... it provides a rationale as to why money is considered compensation for non-pecuniary losses such as loss of amenities, pain and suffering, and loss of expectation of life. Money is awarded because it will serve a useful function in making up for what has been lost in the only way possible, accepting that what has been lost is incapable of being replaced in any direct way. As Windeyer J. said in Skelton v. Collins [(1966), 39 A.L.J.R. 480] at p. 495:\n",
      "... he is, I do not doubt, entitled to compensation for what he suffers. Money may be compensation for him if having it can give him pleasure or satisfaction ... But the money is not then a recompense for a loss of something having a money value. It is given as some consolation or solace for the distress that is the consequence of a loss on which no monetary value can be put\n",

On these vacations Ms. Yick does seem to adapt and find some measure of enjoyment.

      "[259] The principles that govern the measurement of damages for loss of earning capacity were thoroughly discussed in Rosvold v. Dunlop, , . The principles set out in that case can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "the assessment of damages is not a precise mathematical calculation but a matter of judgment;\n",
      "a plaintiff is entitled to be put in the position she would have been but for the accident;\n",
      "an award for loss of earning capacity recognizes that the ability to earn income is an asset and the plaintiff deserves compensation if this asset has been taken away or impaired;\n",
      "since these damages must often be based on a hypothetical, the standard of proof of a hypothetical is \"real and substantial possibility\" and not mere speculation;\n",
      "the court must consider the real and substantial possibilities, and give weight to them according to the percentage chance they would have happened or will happen;\n",
      "one starting approach to valuation may be to compare the likely future of the plaintiff had the accident not happened, and the likely future of the plaintiff after the accident has happened, and to consider the present value of the difference between the amounts earned under these two scenarios. (I note that in using the word \"likely\", the Court on this point was meaning what hypothetical was a real and substantial possibility);\n",

The actuarial calculation takes into account the survival probability of Ms. Yick over that period, but does not take into account any other labour market contingencies.

Mr. Szekely's opinion is that the appropriate multiplier to be used to take labour market contingencies into account was $6,869 to age 65 and $7,387 to age 70, resulting in a total of $164,856 to age 65 or $177,288 to age 70\n",

In O'Connell, the Court of Appeal confirmed that an award for loss of future housekeeping capacity is payable whether or not the plaintiff would have hired replacement services. It seems to me that the same principle is applicable to a claim for loss of future income earning capacity. The actions of the Johnson Defendants have deprived Ms. Yick of an asset, her capacity to work. I do not think it right to build in assumptions about early retirement and voluntary withdrawals from the labour force in the initial assessment of the value of that asset. As a matter of principle, it seems to me that these factors should be taken into account in assessing the award not by reducing the actuarial calculation of potential income but through an overall adjustment for contingencies. In this regard, I do not agree with the defendants' submission that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to lead evidence negating these factors\n",

There were no age related physical limitations on her occupation. There is no evidence that she would have had family responsibilities that would have prompted her to take early retirement. I think that I can also take into consideration that it is common knowledge that people are working longer given the current return on investments in retirement savings. This factor is demonstrated in the statistics presented by Mr. Szekely showing that between 1998 and 2010 the average retirement age for females increased from less than 60 to 61.4\n",

      "116  The trilogy of cases in the Supreme Court of Canada that established an upper limit for non-pecuniary damages also considered the proper basis for assessing damages for cost of future care. It is quite clear that the imposition of the upper limit for non-pecuniary damages was based on the assumption that adequate provision would be made for other losses, including the cost of future care. In Andrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd., , Dickson J., as he then was, stated at 241-242 as follows:\n",
      "The principle that compensation should be full for pecuniary loss is well established. See McGregor on Damages, 13 ed., at p. 738:\n",
      "The plaintiff can recover, subject to the rules of remoteness and mitigation, full compensation for the pecuniary loss he has suffered. This is today a clear principle of law.\n",
      "To the same effect, Kemp & Kemp, Quantum of Damages, vol. 1, 3rd ed., at p. 4: \"The person suffering the damage is entitled to full compensation for the financial loss suffered.\" This broad principle was propounded by Lord Blackburn at an early date in Livingstone v. Rawyards Coal Company [(1980), 5 App. Cas. 25], at p. 39, in these words:\n",
      "I do not think there is any difference of opinion as to its being a general rule that, where any injury is to be compensated by damages, in settling the sum of money to be given for reparation of damages you should as nearly as possible get at that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured, or who has suffered, in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.\n",
      "In theory a claim for the cost of future care is a pecuniary claim for the amount which may reasonably be expected to be expended in putting the injured party in the position he would have been in if he had not sustained the injury. Obviously, a plaintiff who has been gravely and permanently impaired can never be put in the position he would have been in if the tort had not been committed. To this extent, restitutio in integrum is not possible. Money is a barren substitute for health and personal happiness, but to the ex[t]ent within reason that money can be used to sustain or improve the mental or physical health of the injured person it may properly form part of a claim\n",

      "118  In this case I find that Ms. Yick's injuries have had a profound effect on her ability to lead a normal adult life. In his February 1, 2011 report, Dr. Kaushansky described Ms. Yick's ongoing condition as follows:\n",
      "As a result of the accident in question Mrs. Yick sustained a severe and diffuse traumatic brain injury affecting both cortical and subcortical regions. She presents with persistent problems affecting core cognitive domains: memory, attention, speed of information processing and executive skills. With regard to the latter, such weaknesses with working memory, initiation and the monitoring of tasks, as well as with multitasking were noted during the assessment and were reported by her husband to occur within the community--they are considered neurocognitive deficits. A consultant psychiatrist suggested that Mrs. Yick presented with a d[e]mentia (secondary to a neurological injury). While there has been some reported improvement, given the severity of Mrs. Yick's trauma as well as the time since the accident (now over 4 years), it is my opinion that significant deficits will continue to impact all aspects of her cognitive and psychosocial functioning. She will not be competitively employable in the marketplace, but hopefully will find some part-time avocational placements through the support of community-based personnel. I would add that she is at increased risk for the onset of a dementing condition later in her life- it is important to note that a brain injury is not causal to such a neurodegenerative condition, but becomes a \"risk factor\" in its manifestation;\n",
      "...\n",
      "Mrs. Yick has been diagnosed with a personality change due to head trauma (DSM-4/Axis II) and has been receiving psychological treatment. It is my view that what is being witnessed is most probably an organic personality disorder secondary (neurobehavioural) to the injury to her frontal lobe structures - among other regions of the brain - which is characterized by abrupt moodiness and a low frustration tolerance. It is fortunate that there is an absence of any acting-out behaviours\n",

Like Dr. Kaushansky, Dr. Hirsch is of the view that Ms. Yick's impairments are permanent. The consensus of medical opinion is that as a result of her brain injury Ms. Yick lacks initiative and motivation to improve her functioning. While there appears to be general agreement that there is some prospect that Ms. Yick's ability to function could be improved through an intense program of occupational therapy, I am satisfied that Ms. Yick's lack of initiative and motivation present a significant challenge to rehabilitation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "120  It is also important to note that the improved functioning contemplated by the experts would in no way permit Ms. Yick to lead a normal independent life. As I understand it, the occupational therapy under discussion might go so far as to permit Ms. Yick to use public transportation to specific familiar locations, such as nearby shopping malls or to activities that she attends on a regular basis, such as line dancing. It would not make her employable and would not render her capable of undertaking any activities that she was not specifically instructed upon during the therapy. For example, while Ms. Yick might become able to find her way on her own to a local shopping mall if the therapy is successful, she would not be able to translate that ability into the ability to find her way to other shopping areas. There was agreement among the doctors that she will never be able to drive a car because her level of executive functioning is simply not adequate to cope with the normal demands of driving in traffic\n",

Their disagreement is over the duration of occupational therapy that Ms. Yick would benefit from and over the extent of assistance that Ms. Yick will benefit from on a long term basis\n",

Ms. McLean however thinks that Ms. Yick would benefit from an average of 4 to 6 hours per month of case management by an occupational therapist to maintain her level of functioning\n",

      "129  With one exception, for assessment purposes I accept the costs suggested by Ms. Percy for case management by occupational therapists. I generally agree that after an initial occupational therapy intervention, further occupational therapy will be of limited usefulness except when Ms. Yick undergoes significant changes in her accommodation or if Mr. Li plays a lesser role in her care. However, I think that such intervention may well be required more frequently than projected by Ms. Percy. I therefore think that there should be provision for increased episodic occupational therapy services every five years\n",

      "130  While there is a significant difference between the cost of recommended case management after the initial period of treatment, there is a much greater difference between the cost of ongoing community support worker (CSW) services recommended by the occupational therapists. Ms. McLean is of the view that Ms. Yick would benefit from 4 to 6 hours per day of CSW services while Ms. Percy considers that after the first year in which Ms. Yick's abilities will plateau 4 to 8 hours per week should be sufficient. Based on the agreed lowest rates charged for CSW services, this results in a present value cost for Ms. McLean's recommendation of approximately $693,000 for four hours per day, compared to an approximate present value cost of $100,000 for Ms. Percy's recommendation\n",

She is presently incapable of safely leaving her home alone. There is some prospect that with an intensive occupational therapy intervention she will be able to leave her home alone. However this ability will be limited to very familiar routes and destinations. As I understand the evidence, this capability will arise not from any improvement in her underlying cognitive and executive deficiencies but from learning these routes and routines through repetition\n",

At page 10 of her April 21, 2011 report, Ms. McLean sets out some circumstances in which the assistance of a CSW would benefit Ms. Yick. I am also of the view that a CSW is the appropriate person to provide these services. Ms. Percy's report agreed that whatever continuing care assistance Ms. Yick should receive should be provided by a CSW\n",

      "\n",
      "135  Counsel for Mr. Li argued that such assistance need not be provided by a CSW but could be provided at less cost by a domestic companion. It was submitted that such assistance could be provided at approximately $20 per hour. However I think that Ms. Yick would benefit from the assistance of a more highly trained individual. It was the recommendation of both occupational therapists that this assistance be provided by a CSW. I also think that a trained person will be able to recognize changes in Ms. Yick's level of functioning and react accordingly. Finally the evidence of the actual cost of alternative care was somewhat vague. In addition it does not include associated costs such as travel and, if the assistant is an employee, employer's contributions to Employment Insurance, Workers' Compensation, and Canada Pension\n",

Ms. Yick has cognitive and behaviour difficulties that a trained CSW would be able to appreciate and cope with. For example a CSW would have insight into the causes of Ms. Yick's outbursts of anger and frustration. In addition a CSW would be better qualified to assist Ms. Yick in planning and optimizing her organizational skills. I conclude that an untrained companion would not be effective in dealing with these challenges\n",

      "137  The above findings assume that Mr. Li will continue to be available to Ms. Yick and provide her with assistance. Mr. Li is a devoted husband. I conclude that it is unlikely that he would voluntarily withdraw the supports he now provides. However, several doctors have identified that there is a risk of \"caregiver burnout\" in this case. In addition there is a risk that Mr. Li could become psychically unable to continue to provide supports as he ages\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "138  There is some dispute among the experts about Ms. Yick's ability to live independently should Mr. Li no longer be available to her. Dr. Kaushansky is of the view that if Mr. Li is no longer available to Ms. Yick, either significant home support or placement in a supported residential environment for brain injured patients will be necessary. Dr. Hirsch does not specifically comment on this issue. He is of the view that there is no need for night time or day time supervision but does agree that Ms. Yick requires someone to be with her when she leaves home\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "139  This issue brings the role that Mr. Li plays in Ms. Yick's life into focus. The view advanced by the plaintiff is that Mr. Li is acting to a large extent as a caregiver meeting needs that Ms. Yick cannot provide for herself. The other view is that Ms. Yick's rehabilitation is being hampered by Mr. Li's over-protectiveness and that Ms. Yick has the potential to be significantly more independent than she presently is\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "140  These two views inform the divergent recommendations of the two occupational therapists. Ms. McLean states that Ms. Yick would not be able to live alone without her husband's contribution to the household. Ms. Percy is of the view that Ms. Yick could live in an apartment setting on her own with the same level of supports that she recommends should she continue to live with Mr. Li\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "141  Based on all of the evidence, including that of Mr. Li and those lay witnesses who have observed Ms. Yick in the community I find that Mr. Li has acted as a caregiver to Ms. Yick ever since the accident. Without Mr. Li, Ms. Yick could not live independently without significant community supports. She clearly would require assistance with any activity that required her to leave her home. Based on the observations of Ms. McLean at the home shared by Ms. Yick and Mr. Li, she clearly would require significant guidance and assistance in looking after and organizing her home. I agree that there is scope for Ms. Yick to develop more independence than she currently has but I do not think that she is capable of independent living without substantial supports\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "142  I think that some insight into the basis for Ms. Percy's opinion is found in her March 7, 2012 report at page 2, in which she states:\n",
      "In order to minimize potential risk for Ms. Yick related to poor working memory, planning or organization with novel activities, the care report outlines supports and services to expand her abilities and repertoire of activities (i.e. attending the gym; using local transit routes) with rehearsal and repetition. The basic premise is to help Ms. Yick consolidate the skills so that daily tasks or activities shift from being \"novel\" to more \"procedural\", systematic and familiar. In addition, her daily routines would be limited to a range of activities that are purposeful but familiar and over learned, with limited expectations that she perform unfamiliar tasks or be exposed to situations where more complex working memory or problem-solving is required.\n",
      "[Emphasis added.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "143  As I read the above quoted paragraph, the goal of Ms. Percy's care plan contemplates a limiting of Ms. Yick's future daily routines to those that she becomes habituated to through training and repetition. In my view this objective, would not achieve the objectives of a pecuniary award for future care in that it would not have as its goal doing all that is reasonably possible to put Ms. Yick in the same position she would have been in had she not suffered her injuries\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "144  The passage from Andrews quoted in para. 116 makes it clear that the object of an award for future care is to do what can reasonably be done to put the injured party in the position she would have been in had she not sustained her injury\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "145  It is clear that Ms. Yick cannot be restored to her original condition. However, I think that she now benefits from Mr. Li providing her with supports that go beyond the objective of Ms. Percy's care plan. I am satisfied on the evidence that a good deal of the activities that presently enrich Ms. Yick's life, such as meals out and shopping trips would be significantly curtailed without Mr. Li's assistance\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "146  I am not satisfied that Ms. Yick would in fact be able to achieve the level of competence set out in Ms. Percy's care plan. The care plan does not seem to address Ms. Yick's acknowledged lack of initiative and diminished insight into her own limitations. It is one thing to learn to do a task. It is quite another to be able to summon the energy to undertake it or even recognize that it is necessary or appropriate to undertake it. In addition, the case plan advocated by Ms. Percy does not make adequate provision for the possibility that Ms. Yick could not attain or sustain the improvements Ms. Percy expects\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "147  I conclude that even if the occupational therapy intervention recommended by Ms. Percy is successful, Ms. Yick will require ongoing cueing and guidance to have a reasonable quality of life in the future. If Mr. Li is not available to provide that cueing and guidance Ms. Yick will require outside caregivers to provide it\n",
      "======\n",

      "148  I am also satisfied that the claim for housekeeping services of two hours per week is warranted. I note that there is ample evidence in this case of a marked reduction in Ms. Yick's housekeeping capacity both from Mr. Li and Ms. McLean. While no claim for loss of housekeeping capacity as such has been advanced, the claim for housekeeping services as an item of future care does overlap with such a claim. I consider the claim made in this regard to be modest and entirely reasonable. There is no dispute as to the annual cost of these services\n",

      "150  Ms. Yick also advances a claim for psychological counselling. Both occupational therapists agree that some counselling will probably be necessary but they disagree on the amount that is reasonably required. I agree with the recommendation of Ms. Percy that the necessity for such counselling will be episodic rather than continuous. Accordingly, I adopt her recommendation that an allowance be made for intermittent counselling. As I am of the view that initial counselling in connection with the proposed occupational therapy will be beneficial, I find that it is reasonable to make provision for counselling sessions every five years over Ms. Yick's lifetime to address future changes in her circumstances\n",

I am not persuaded that ongoing massage therapy will be necessary for Ms. Yick's future health as opposed to a source of relaxation and enjoyment. Ongoing massage therapy, if desired, should therefore be funded out of the non-pecuniary damage award. I agree with Ms. Percy that an award be made to permit Ms. Yick to participate in 36 sessions over the next year as she increases her activity level. In this regard I make an award of $3000\n",

However, unlike their disagreement with respect to the calculation of past and future income loss, there did not appear to be any significant disagreement between them about how to calculate the present value of the cost of the various items of future care. Accordingly I will summarize the amounts I have awarded and determine their present value before going on to consider contingencies\n",

      "\n",
      "156  Based on the costing provided by the occupational therapist and because I am in general agreement with Ms. Percy's views that there will be limited need for case management after year one, I assess the cost of future case management in the following table. In so doing, I have used the midpoint of the cost ranges set out in Ms. Percy's report:\n",
      "CSW Assistanc\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "157  The most significant element of the cost of future care claim is the amount of CSW assistance that Ms. Yick reasonably requires. I have already concluded that she should receive 28 hours a week while she continues to live with Mr. Li. Such assistance will help Ms. Yick both with more effectively dealing with household tasks and provide her with an enhanced ability to leave home and engage in activities outside of it. It will also replace some of the care that Mr. Li now provides. The law is well settled that family members and spouses are not required to provide such care (see Milina v. Bartsch  (S.C.) at 88)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "158  Counsel for the defendants argued that there would be periods, such as when Ms. Yick is travelling, when no assistance will be required and an adjustment ought therefore to be made to this award. However, I have taken that into account in arriving at an average weekly amount of assistance. There may be trips that Mr. Li would take an assistant along. On other trips, such as cruises, companion assistance may well be available. I also think that it is more appropriate to take this factor into account in arriving at an overall contingency for the cost of future care\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "159  In assessing this head of damage, I use the lower cost of $27.13 per hour provided by Ms. McLean. The annual cost of providing 4 hours per day of such assistance is $39,610. Using the multiplier of 17.490 provided by Mr. Carson, the present value of this amount to the end of Ms. Yick's life expectancy is $692,779 (say $690,000).\n",
      "Housekeeping Assistanc\n",
      "======\n",

      "160  There is consensus among the experts that Ms. Yick will require two hours per week in housekeeping assistance. The cost of this assistance on an annual basis is $2,366. The present value is $41,381 plus HST of $2,204 for a total of $43,585 (say $43,500)\n",

      "161  The next item of future care is for counselling. I agree with Ms. Percy that Ms. Yick is unlikely to benefit from extensive counselling given her lack of insight and motivational impairments. Accordingly I consider that an award of $3,000 in the first year and every five years thereafter for counselling to be adequate. This results in an award of $3,000 x 0.981 or $2943 plus 3000/1000 x $3,694 or $11,082, together rounded to $14,000\n",

The first is for Ms. Yick to continue to live in a house with increased support services. The second is for Ms. Yick to move into a supported apartment living arrangement in which she would receive supports in place of the individual support program she would require if she continued to live in a house. The third is for Ms. Yick to live in a group home for individuals with acquired brain injury\n",

      "168  Ms. Percy has commented on each of these possibilities. In her view it would not be practicable for Ms. Yick to continue to live alone in a house. She suggested that Ms. Yick could live in an apartment with the same level of support she recommended for her if she continued to live in her house with Mr. Li. She did not think that Ms. Yick would be a good candidate for a group home because of her neuro-behavioural issues. However, she did in a supplemental report state that Ms. Yick might be a good candidate for a shared support program such as that offered by Cheshire Homes Society. The annual cost for such services, $34,675 per year is comparable to the cost of the additional supports recommended by Ms. McLean, should Ms. Yick continue to live with Mr. Li\n",

      "169  I think that the most probable scenario is that Ms. Yick will continue to live with Mr. Li and be able to rely upon him for continuing support. However, I also find that there is a substantial possibility that she will find herself without such support as a result of some future event such as Mr. Li becoming incapacitated or predeceasing her or in the event of a breakdown of their marriage. I find that if such an event occurs Ms. Yick will require a greater level of assistance than she does while living with her husband\n",

The plaintiff preferred that her husband provide a significant amount of that care. The trial judge awarded the full amount of having outside providers provide the care, reasoning that the amount of such care should be awarded even if the plaintiff chose not to avail herself of it. The Court of Appeal held that this was an error and that it was necessary to take the question of whether the plaintiff would actually use the services into account in assessing damages. As I read the decision, the Court of Appeal reduced the trial judge's assessment by 20% to reflect the fact that the services were currently being provided by the plaintiff's husband, but not more than 20% because his capacity to provide the services would decrease over time while her needs had the potential to increase\n",

In this case I accept the evidence of Ms. McLean that six to eight hours of personal assistance per day would be required should Mr. Li be no longer available. Based on the rate of $27.13 per hour and taking an average of seven hours per day, this translates into an annual cost of $69,300.

I consider 25% to be appropriate because I think that Mr. Li will likely be able to provide assistance longer than the plaintiff's husband in O'Connell, who was considerably older.

Clarke Road has two eastbound lanes coming down a hill, with a third dedicated left-hand turning lane at the intersection. It is also known as \"Snake Hill\" because it curves and has a steep incline. Port Moody Secondary School is located near the intersection of Clarke Road and the Barnet Highway\n",
      "======\n",

      "5  The weather was clear, the roads were dry and traffic on Clarke Road was light at the time of the Accident, which occurred at approximately 11:30 a.m. There were several high school students present in the area at the time. One of them, Sarah Davidson, testified at trial, as did the plaintiff. The defendant did not testify, as he is deceased\n",

      "6  Ms. Davidson was standing at the bus stop on the north side of Clarke Road when the Accident happened. As a result, she had a clear view of what transpired. The bus stop is close to Craftsman Collision, which is located at the corner of Clarke Road and Barnet Highway. An employee of Craftsman, Craig Johnson, also saw the Accident and testified regarding his observations. Their accounts are very similar, as is that of Jim Giles, a retired businessman, who also testified\n",

      "8  Mr. Giles was driving eastbound down the hill on Clarke Road in the middle lane, approximately seven or eight car lengths directly behind the defendant's truck at the time of the Accident. Because of the steep incline on Clarke Road, he was able to see over the top of the defendant's truck as he drove eastbound behind it\n",

      "\n",
      "9  The traffic light was green for Mr. Giles and the defendant when they came around a curved portion of Clarke Road and drove toward the Barnet Highway. Mr. Giles estimated that he and the defendant were both exceeding the speed limit by approximately 5-10 kph as they approached the intersection. Given the known presence of children in the area, Mr. Giles acknowledged that the speed he and the defendant were travelling at was excessive. I accept his evidence on this point and find that the defendant was speeding when the Accident occurred\n",
      "======\n",

      "10  As he came around the curve and approached the intersection, Mr. Giles noticed the plaintiff and another boy walking across Clarke Road diagonally, north to south, approximately 10-20 feet west of the crosswalk, against the red light. The defendant's truck was approximately 50 yards away from the plaintiff when the plaintiff started to cross the road. Like Mr. Giles, the defendant first saw the plaintiff and the other boy as he came around the curve\n",

His failure to slow down worried Mr. Giles, who was concerned that the defendant would come close to hitting the boys. Unfortunately, Mr. Giles' concern was well founded\n",

If it is reasonably foreseeable or apparent that a pedestrian will disregard the law and thus create a hazardous situation, a driver is obliged to take all reasonable steps to avoid a collision.

Courts must gauge the amount by which each proximate and effective causative agent fell short of the standard of care that was required of that person in all of the circumstances.\n",
      "[107] In assessing the respective fault and blameworthiness of the parties as contemplated in Cempel, courts are to evaluate the extent or degree to which each party departed from the standard of care each party owed under the circumstances: Alberta Wheat Pool v. Northwest Pile Driving Ltd.,  (B.C.C.A.) at para. 46. Finch J.A. (as he then was) described the range of blameworthiness, as follows:\n",
      "Fault may vary from extremely careless conduct, by which the party shows a reckless indifference or disregard for the safety of person or property, whether his own or others, down to a momentary or minor lapse of care in conduct which, nevertheless, carries with it the risk of foreseeable harm\n",

Rather, taking into account the plaintiff's presentation in the witness stand, including his obvious occasional confusion, together with his age and the nature of the inconsistencies, I conclude that the plaintiff misunderstood some of what he was asked at trial, on discovery and by his treatment providers.

Given his age, circumstances and the low grade nature of his ongoing discomfort, in my view this course of conduct was predictable and understandable. As Ms. Rahn testified, the fact of discharge from physiotherapy did not equate to a full recovery and the plaintiff was advised to continue exercising in response to his ongoing symptoms.

Nevertheless, I find that he was a generally credible witness and rely upon his evidence. In particular, I find that since the Accident the plaintiff has suffered from ongoing, low-grade lower back and shoulder pain. I also find that, as a result, his ability to engage in competitive sports and other physically demanding activities has been compromised, although not brought to an end\n",

Both testified, and I accept, that the plaintiff, who they knew well, changed noticeably after the Accident. According to Mr. Durant and Rafet Hmaied, as well as the plaintiff himself, the plaintiff was unable to return to sports at his pre-Accident level and was eventually cut from the gold soccer team. As a result, according to all three, he gradually withdrew from his sports-oriented peer group and his level of physical fitness and social confidence decreased, although he remained physically and socially active.

Dr. Underwood was a direct, balanced, credible witness whose evidence I accept. According to Dr. Underwood the plaintiff's primary pain and injury is to his lower lumbar back, which injury was caused by Accident. In addition, she testified that his left shoulder pain is caused by the injuries he suffered in the Accident\n",

      "51  According to Dr. Underwood, it is difficult to determine whether the plaintiff's left shoulder pain is a primary or secondary Accident-related injury. On balance, taking into account the totality of the evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff's left shoulder pain is a secondary injury flowing from his objectively observable asymmetrical body, which asymmetry flows from the primary soft tissue injury he sustained to his lower back. As Dr. Underwood explained, this shoulder pain arises as a result of the plaintiff's compensatory, pain-avoidance behaviour. In consequence, it developed over time\n",

      "52  Dr. Underwood also opined that the plaintiff will continue to have ongoing shoulder and low back pain unless he receives further medical intervention.

Although I do not find his dream of winning a sports scholarship was demonstrably realistic, I am satisfied that, until the Accident, the plaintiff genuinely held it.

In assessing whether a loss of earning capacity has been suffered the court must consider factors such as whether the plaintiff has been rendered less capable overall of earning income from all types of employment; is less marketable or attractive as a potential employee; has lost the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities that might otherwise have been open; and is less valuable to himself or herself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour market: Brown v.

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "22  Section 174 of the Act reads as follows:\n",
      "When a vehicle is in an intersection and its driver intends to turn left, the driver must yield the right of way to traffic approaching from the opposite direction that is in the intersection or so close as to constitute an immediate hazard, but having yielded and given a signal as required by sections 171 and 172, the driver may turn the vehicle to the left, and traffic approaching the intersection from the opposite direction must yield the right of way to the vehicle making the left turn.\n",
      "Cases which have analysed this section of the Motor Vehicle Act have defined the left turning vehicle as the servient vehicle and the vehicle approaching from the opposite direction as the dominant vehicle. The issue is whether the Yuen vehicle, the dominant vehicle, was so close to the intersection as to constitute an \"immediate hazard\" to Ms. Kelly within the meaning of s. 174.\n",
      "Governing Legal Principle\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "23  The legal principles with regards to left turn situations have been addressed in many cases. In Pacheco (Guardian ad litem) v. Robinson  (C.A.) at para. 15, Legg J. stated:\n",
      "In my opinion, a driver who wishes to make a left hand turn at an intersection has an obligation not to proceed unless it can be done safely. Where each party's vision of the other is blocked by traffic, the dominant driver who is proceeding through the intersection is generally entitled to continue and the servient left-turning driver must yield the right of way. The existence of a left-turning vehicle does not raise a presumption that something unexpected might happen and cast a duty on the dominant driver to take extra care. Where the defendant, as here, has totally failed to determine whether a turn can be made safely, the defendant should be held 100 percent at fault for a collision which occurs\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  In Carich v. Cook  at 326 (B.C.C.A.), Lambert J.A. had this to say:\n",
      "... The question as a driver turns left is whether there is any vehicle in any approaching lanes that constitutes an immediate hazard. If there is, the turn should not be made. If there is not, then the turn can be made and of course, care should be taken throughout the turn and as each new lane is entered to make sure that the situation as it was assessed when the turn started has not changed in the meantime. ..\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "25  Of course, each case must be determined on its own particular facts. For example, in Uyeyama (Guardian ad litem of) v. Wittenberg,  (C.A.), the BC Court of Appeal determined that a left-turning was not negligent for having entered an intersection, having failed to detect the excessive speed of the defendant's vehicle. In addition, the left-turning driver was entitled to assume that the oncoming vehicle would stop at a red light and according to traffic law. The court concluded at para. 44 that the left turning driver had \"exercised due care and commendable prudence in taking the action she did in attempting to make a difficult left turn.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  This case was cited with approval by the BC Court of Appeal in Kokkinis v. Hall  (C.A.)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  The court in Kokkinis considered other cases where the court held in favour of the servient driver. The court looked to Morgan v. Hauck  (C.A.), a case where the BC Court of Appeal held that a dominant vehicle which had accelerated towards an intersection despite amber warning lights and then entered the intersection when the light was red could not rely on the relevant section of the Motor Vehicle Act to escape liability. In Kokkinis at para. 6, Newbury J.A. speaking for the court summarized the position taken in Morgan as follows:\n",
      "... Esson, J.A. (as he then was), for example emphasised the \"heavy onus which rests upon drivers approaching signals of this kind to make due allowance for the possibility that there will be a vehicle seeking to make a turn such as the plaintiff was making on this day. Their clear duty is to comply with the warning lights and to not 'run the red'.\" But for the fact that appellate courts should, he said, vary apportionments of blame made by trial judges only in very rare circumstances, Esson, J.A. (with whom Macfarlane, J.A. concurred) would have considered setting aside even the 10 percent allocation of fault\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  At para. 7 of Kokkinis, Newbury J.A. considered the Court of Appeal's decision in Brucks v. Caslavsky, , and stated the following:\n",
      "A more recent case from this Court along similar lines is Brucks et al. v. Caslavsky et al. (19 April 1994) Vancouver Registry CA016390 (B.C.C.A.), which apparently was not cited to the trial judge. There, this Court rejected the argument that the onus placed by s. 176 of the Act is \"absolute\" and that in deciding whether an oncoming car constitutes an \"immediate hazard\", a left-turning driver must consider the possibility that any oncoming motorist may intend to speed through an intersection and disobey the traffic signal. Taylor, J.A. for the Court quoted the well-known statement of principle of Lord Atkinson in Toronto Ry. Co. v. King et al. , at 269:\n",
      ". . . traffic in the streets would be impossible if the driver of each vehicle did not proceed more or less on the assumption that the drivers of all other vehicles will do what it is their duty to do, namely, observe the rules regulating the traffic of the streets\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  Even though Kokkinis and Morgan dealt with vehicles which approached an intersection and turned left on an amber light, the principles and observations stated in these decisions are helpful. At para. 10 of Kokkinis the court stated that the servient driver should not be faulted for having diverted her attention momentarily from oncoming traffic to check cross traffic. This is because servient drivers have \"the duty to be aware not only of oncoming traffic, but also of cross traffic, pedestrians, and whatever else may be present in the intersection.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  At the same paragraph, the court added:\n",
      "... To say that the plaintiff can be found at fault because she relied on the assumption that Mr. Hall would stop, and because she checked cross-traffic, would in my view subvert the duty on Mr. Hall to bring his vehicle to a safe stop at the amber light as the other traffic did. ..\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  The authorities make it clear in my opinion that for liability to be found against the dominant driver in situations where the servient driver is making a left turn in front of stopped traffic, the evidence must establish that the dominant driver had a sufficient opportunity to avoid the accident, of which a reasonably careful and skilful driver would have availed him or herself (Pacheco, para. 18).\n",
      "Ms. Kelly's Evidenc\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "32  There is no question that any driver negotiating a left-hand turn with traffic backed up and opposite drivers leaving the intersection clear must be very cautious and aware of the circumstances in order to avoid a motor vehicle approaching in the curb lane. Ms. Kelly says she did proceed carefully\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "33  She testified that when the driver in the inside lane waved her to make her turn she moved to the start of the middle lane. She came to a stop. She saw that the driver in this lane then waved her to continue her turn. She advanced to the \"start\" of the curb lane. She testified she looked to her right to check for traffic in the curb lane. She testified she could see \"quite a ways up the block\". Seeing no buses or bicycles, or in fact cars, she looked to her left. She testified she did this in order to ensure there were no pedestrians crossing Manitoba Street, as they too would have the green light. Seeing none, she \"proceeded cautiously\" through the third lane. She testified she heard \"screeching\", looked to her right and was \"smashed\" by the Yuen vehicle. She testified that at impact she was moving \"very slowly\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  Ms. Kelly was cross-examined extensively, especially with respect to her line of sight and how far down the curb lane she was able to see prior to entering into the curb lane. She testified she had not entered the curb lane before she looked right. She could not recall the type of vehicle in the inside or middle lanes but could see down the curb lane. Her discovery evidence from November 6, 2009 and her statement to ICBC made the day after the accident was put to her. At trial she testified she could see \"more than half way up the block\". At the discovery she testified \"almost a full block down\". I see no material discrepancy in this part of her evidence. This evidence cannot be measured with precision. While Ms. Kelly may be inaccurately estimating how far down the curb lane she could see prior to entering the curb lane, I accept her evidence that she looked and observed no traffic of any kind when she commenced the final portion of the turn\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  Her evidence is supported to a significant extent by the evidence of Mr. Bowlerd, an engineer who gave expert evidence as to sight-lines, reaction times, and how far vehicles would travel at various speeds. Mr. Bowlerd acknowledged that if the Yuen vehicle was travelling at speeds greater than 30 kilometres per hour, the Yuen vehicle might well have been \"outside\" of Ms. Kelly's line of sight\n",

      "36  Nevertheless, the defendants say Ms. Kelly was negligent in failing to keep a proper lookout, that she should have been more careful when negotiating the turn and been aware of the Yuen vehicle in the curb lane, notwithstanding the fact that it should not have been in the lane at the time.\n",

Mr. Yuen testified he was stopped behind four or five cars leading up to the intersection of Manitoba and Broadway. He testified he stopped at that point for 10 to 15 seconds. He then turned into the curb lane. He acknowledged he knew this curb lane was restricted to buses and bicycles at that hour of the morning\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  He testified he turned into the curb lane because he wanted to proceed further along Broadway before making a right turn at Columbia street, the next intersection after Manitoba. The photographs show this is some distance down Broadway from Manitoba. The restriction on cars from using the curb lane at that time continues along Broadway. He testified that he wanted to make this right turn on Columbia rather than proceed down Broadway to the medical office because traffic was busy and \"I thought I would go another route\" because of the traffic and construction along Cambie Street\n",

      "40  Counsel for the defence submits Mr. Yuen was entitled to enter the curb lane to make a right turn a full block past Manitoba Street. I do not agree.

      "48  But as Mr. Ross submitted on behalf of Ms. Kelly, given the evidence of Mr. Bowlerd that in an emergency a driver generally takes 1.1 seconds to respond by applying the brakes, even at only 30 kilometres per hour, Mr. Yuen would have travelled four or five car-lengths and hit Ms. Kelly before even applying his brakes. This scenario is inconsistent even with the evidence of Mr. Yuen. He said he stepped on the brake \"hard\". It is also inconsistent with the evidence of Mr. Butler who observed the Yuen vehicle skidding some distance before entering the intersection. As a result, I do not accept Mr. Yuen's evidence he was travelling at only 30 kilometres per hour or that he pulled into the curb lane as close to the intersection as he says he did\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "49  On this point the key fact was Mr. Butler's observation that the Yuen vehicle was skidding in the curb lane adjacent to a lamp standard, a distance he estimated as approximately 18 meters east of the intersection. There is indeed a lamp standard 15.8 meters east of Manitoba. I accept Mr. Butler's evidence when he testified he observed the Yuen vehicle skidding from approximately that distance\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "50  I do not accept Mr. Yuen's evidence that he was one to two feet from the intersection when he applied the brakes and started skidding\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "51  Mr. Yuen's evidence was also contradicted by the evidence of Mr. West, an engineer who provided expert evidence as to \"the approach speed of the Yuen vehicle and to assess whether the Yuen vehicle could accelerate to the calculated speed from a stopped position, four to five cars from the intersection\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "52  Mr. West estimated from the damage to the vehicles that the speed of the Yuen vehicle \"when it struck the Kelly Acura was between 10 and 15 km/h\". As a result, Mr. West concluded \"that the speed of the Yuen vehicle was between 56 and 62 km/h (with 80 percent certainty) with a median, or most probable speed, of 59 km/h\" when it began to skid\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "53  I accept the evidence of both experts. Their combined evidence establishes Mr. Yuen was travelling at an excessive speed given the circumstances and was far enough down the curb lane as to not be observable to Ms. Kelly when she commenced her turn\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "54  As stated by Currie J. in Peek et al. v. S. Cunard & Co.  at 241 (N.S.C.A.), and adopted by Davey J.A. in Keen v. Stene  at 359 (B.C.C.A.), \"Speed and distance generally determine what constitutes an immediate hazard.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "55  As Ker J. said in Rothenbusch v. Van Boeyen, , at para. 146:\n",
      "The question of immediate hazard and right of way, however, is to be assessed temporally in the moment before the driver proposing to make the left hand turn at issue commences to make it: Raie, , pp. 413-414. If an approaching car does not present an immediate hazard when the manoeuvre is commenced but later creates one by unreasonable conduct such as speeding, the approaching driver will be held responsible for the ensuing collision: Devidi v. Lam,  (S.C.); Rollins v. Lovely, , at para. 35\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "56  I am mindful of the comments of Legg J.A. in Pacheco. I accept that the presence of a left turning driver does not create a presumption that something unexpected might happen or impose a duty on the dominant driver to take extra care. However as is emphasized in Brucks, and noted in Kokkinis, a dominant driver is obligated to \"observe the rules regulating the traffic of the streets\". By failing to operate his motor vehicle in the allowed lane of travel and at a speed appropriate to traffic conditions, Mr. Yuen breached this duty and fell below the standard expected of a careful and prudent driver on the morning in question\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "57  I appreciate that Goepel J. in Robinson v. Wong, , considered a dominant driver's liability under s. 174 of the Motor Vehicle Act in a situation where a dominant driver in a curb lane hit a left turning driver. Goepel J. at para. 22 said the following:\n",
      "... Mr. Wong was not required to slow down or come to a stop because traffic in the adjoining southbound lanes was backing up. Nothing about the situation would alert him that Ms. Robinson would disregard her statutory duty and fail to yield the right of way. The photographs disclose that impact was between the left front of Mr. Wong's vehicle and the right front of Ms. Robinson's vehicle. The location of the damage suggests that the collision would have occurred almost immediately after Ms. Robinson entered into the curb lane. In the circumstances, the defendant had no reasonable opportunity to avoid the collision\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "58  In drawing this conclusion, Goepel J. found Ms. Robinson not to be a credible witness and did not accept her evidence that she stopped before turning or first checked to see if there was oncoming traffic approaching the intersection\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "59  The circumstances here are significantly different. This is not a situation where the servient driver has disregarded her statutory duty. Here it is just the reverse. Mr. Yuen flagrantly ignored the restriction on travel in the curb lane in a clear attempt, in my opinion, to drive along the restricted lane in order to get to his destination earlier rather than wait like other responsible drivers who were complying with the curb lane restriction. As Esson J.A. said in Morgan, I am satisfied that Mr. Yuen should have made \"due allowance for the possibility that there will be a vehicle seeking to make a turn such as the plaintiff was making on this day\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "60  As Ker J. said in Rothenbusch at para. 149, \"Who has the statutory right of way is informative; however, it does not determine liability in an accident. Drivers with a statutory right of way must still exercise caution to avoid accidents where possible.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "61  In these circumstances, I am satisfied a reasonably careful and prudent driver would not have pulled into the restricted curb lane, as Mr. Yuen did with limited vision, and accelerate towards a backed up intersection at an excessive rate of speed. As the dominant driver, Mr. Yuen was not required to take \"extraordinary steps to avoid an accident or to show exceptional proficiency in the operation of a motor vehicle.\" (Salaam v. Abramovic,  at para. 25). However, I am satisfied a reasonably prudent driver, exercising reasonable caution, would have had a sufficient opportunity to avoid the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "62  Furthermore, Ms. Kelly did not breach her statutory duty under s. 174 to yield the right of way. She took reasonable steps to determine she could make the left turn safely. The evidence which I have accepted establishes that when Ms. Kelly looked right and entered the curb lane, the Yuen vehicle was not \"so close as to constitute an immediate hazard\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  As a result, I am satisfied that the accident was caused solely by the negligent driving of Mr. Yuen. The defence has not established any contributory negligence on the part of Ms. Kelly.\n",
      "The Injuries\n",
      "Soft Tissu\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  There is no question that Ms. Kelly suffered from moderate soft-tissue injuries to her neck, back, and shoulders. Fortunately these resolved within a reasonable period of time. The plaintiff submits an appropriate award for these injuries would be $30,000. Counsel for the defence submits the appropriate range is between $20,000 and $25,000.\n",
      "The Right Kne\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "65  The difficult question is whether the plaintiff has established that the accident was a contributing factor to the onset of the symptoms in her knee, which of course are consistent with osteoarthritis, especially in persons in Ms. Kelly's age group\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "66  Given the medical evidence, the critical point in answering this question is when did Ms. Kelly actually first experience pain and swelling in her knee\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "67  The evidence and resulting medical opinions on this point are inconsistent and contradictory. Three experts testified: Dr. Travlos, a physiatrist, who is a duly qualified and registered physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist in the province of British Columbia; Dr. Blachut, an experienced orthopaedic surgeon who performed arthroscopic surgery on Ms. Kelly's right knee on November 6, 2008; and Dr. Leith, another experienced orthopaedic surgeon who provided a medical report for the defendants\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  Ms. Kelly testified that she was \"jarred\" in the accident, her lower leg hit the console and her right knee hit the gear shift\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "69  As mentioned, Ms. Kelly arranged to see her family doctor, Dr. Lepard, the day after the accident. Dr. Lepard reported that Ms. Kelly complained of neck and back pain. She wrote that Ms. Kelly \"had intermittent pain down both legs with certain movements\". There was no complaint from Ms. Kelly about right knee pain and nothing was recorded by Dr. Lepard as to any problems with Ms. Kelly's right knee at that point in time. Ms. Kelly testified that she saw Dr. Lepard again on May 7, 2008. Ms. Kelly testified that \"in that time my right knee was very swollen and extremely sore\". She testified she noticed a \"slight small bruise\" on the outside of her knee. Most importantly, she testified she \"believed\" she first noticed pain and swelling the evening after her first visit to Dr. Lepard\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "70  Dr. Lepard's report of her examination on May 7, 2008 is not consistent with Ms. Kelly's evidence when she describes this very significant swelling to her \"whole knee\". Dr. Lepard notes in her report \"her other complaint was of her right knee which was painful on the inner side of the joint\". On examination \"she was tender around the inner joint of the right knee, with a good range of movement and no instability\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  As Mr. Hood, on behalf of the defendants submits, Dr. Lepard's report mentions \"absolutely nothing about swelling and a bruise to the right knee.\" This is especially troubling when Ms. Kelly testified at trial that on May 7, 2008, \"my right knee was the focus of my attention\". Common sense dictates that if her whole knee was very swollen and extremely sore and the focus of her visit, Dr. Lepard would have made a notation of such symptoms\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "72  As I have noted, Ms. Kelly testified she only \"believed\" the knee became painful the night after the accident. Moreover, there is no record in Dr. Lepard's notes as to when in the time between April 30, 2008 and May 7, 2008 Ms. Kelly first experienced pain in her knee, let alone whether this occurred during the evening after first seeing Dr. Lepard\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "73  Moreover, because there is no evidence as to Ms. Kelly telling any of the doctors that dealt with her that she \"noticed\" slight bruising sometime after the accident, and that this disclosure was only forthcoming after Dr. Leith's testimony at trial, I do not accept her evidence on this point. I agree with Mr. Hood's submission that if there had indeed been any bruising, she would have disclosed this to at least one of her doctors, especially when she says her knee was \"the focus\" of her attention when she saw Dr. Lepard the second time\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "74  Even though I have accepted Ms. Kelly's evidence with respect to her operation of her motor vehicle, I do not accept her evidence as to the presence of a slight bruise sometime after her first visit to Dr. Lepard\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "75  Additionally, given the equivocal nature of her evidence, I am not satisfied Ms. Kelly's evidence is reliable as to when she first experienced pain in her knee. I accept that her knee became painful sometime between her first and second visit to Dr. Lepard but I am not satisfied the pain materialised the evening after the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "76  I now turn to Dr. Travlos' opinion. Dr. Travlos evaluated Ms. Kelly on October 22, 2009. He referred to Dr. Lepard's records in his report. He noted that, based on Dr. Lepard's report, Ms. Kelly complained of back, neck pain and right knee pain. He then stated, \"It is my opinion that all of those symptoms were a direct consequence of the accident of April 25, 2008.\" I note that the date of the accident is incorrect but I am satisfied this doesn't affect Dr. Travlos' opinion\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "77  Dr. Travlos noted that Dr. Lepard's records did not indicate any complaint about pain or soreness to Ms. Kelly's right knee on the first visit. He did note Dr. Lepard's entry for May 7, 2008 and stated Ms. Kelly described pain \"over the inner aspect of her right knee\". Dr. Travlos testified that as there were no symptoms prior to the accident, and even though Ms. Kelly was definitely at risk of developing pain in her knee \"in the future because of her osteoarthritis\", it was his opinion the accident \"rendered her knee symptomatic\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "78  He acknowledged however at page 5 of his report that \"the ongoing problems that she now has are a result of the underlying degenerative change\" and that:\n",
      "It is more probable than not that at some point in the future Ms. Kelly would have gone on to develop pains from the degenerating knee in the absence of the accident. It is difficult to say with any certainty just when that might have occurred, as it might have been years before the knee became spontaneously symptomatic. On the other hand, it may have also occurred within weeks or days from the time of his [sic] accident in the absence of the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "79  Dr. Travlos stated in his report that the onset of symptoms can occur following relatively mild trauma such as something as simple as stepping off a curb, or moving in an unusual way, or pursuant to a more forceful trauma such as a slip, a fall or a motor vehicle accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  Dr. Blachut was called by the defence. He provided the court with a report confirming his arthroscopic surgery on Ms. Kelly's right knee. He observed degenerative changes in the knee joint. He reported:\n",
      "This woman presents with a significant internal derangement in her knee with meniscal lesions associated with significant articular surface injuries particularly in the medial compartment. The relationship to the motor vehicle accident is unclear. Certainly by history she had no symptoms or problems related to that knee previously. Despite this it is possible that she did have some degenerative processes in the works in her knee prior to the accident and that the accident brought the problem to prominence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "81  Dr. Blachut testified that he wrote \"the relationship to the accident is unclear\" because of the arthritis in Ms. Kelly's knee. He testified the presence of degenerative arthritis makes it \"difficult\" to determine whether the accident and the bumping of her knee on the console as Ms. Kelly has described \"caused anything further\" to her knee. As noted above, his report stated it was \"possible\" the accident \"brought the problem to prominence\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "82  Dr. Blachut also acknowledged that, irrespective of the accident, it would likely have been only a matter of time before Ms. Kelly's degenerative arthritis would have become symptomatic\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  Defence counsel suggests that after a meeting with Ms. Kelly's counsel, Dr. Blachut modified his opinion. In a letter dated June 10, 2010, Dr. Blachut wrote, \"it is very likely that the accident was related to the degenerative arthritis in her knee becoming symptomatic\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  On this point Dr. Blachut testified in cross-examination:\n",
      " A  I don't actually think there is a change. You know, basically she has -- she has degenerative arthritis of the knee, and she had, as far as I could tell, had no symptoms before she had an accident. There was findings of degenerative arthritis at the time. There was a lapse of time between the injury and the time she actually has the surgery. There's a potential that whatever injury happened aggravated the degenerative process in that time frame. It's possible that -- that it's clear that she had onset of symptoms subsequently, and so whether or not the degenerative arthritis was actually caused by the accident, it's not likely. \n",
      "It's -- certainly her symptoms had a direct relationship to the accident, or the initiation of symptoms, the time frame, the chronology would make it consistent with the accident having -- being involved. So in terms of producing the condition, I suspect -- I mean, it was pre-existent, because changes like that that one sees on x-rays and the changes she had take longer to evolve than the time frame involved. But clearly there -- from the symptoms point of view, there was a nuance that wasn't there previously\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  It is also important to note that unlike Dr. Leith, Dr. Blachut testified he did not review Dr. Lepard's report when preparing his report. If he had done so, he would have been aware that there was no report of discomfort or pain in Ms. Kelly's right knee at the time of the accident or the next day\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  In his report, under the heading of \"History\", Dr. Blachut wrote the following:\n",
      "At the time of the accident she recalled that she was able to walk but because of discomfort in her knee she saw her family practitioner the following day\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "87  He was asked \"Is that accurate?\" He replied, \"That's -- yep, that's what it says\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "88  There are two significant difficulties with his opinion. First, Dr. Blachut's report is based on information he received from Ms. Kelly that she had immediate \"discomfort\" in her knee and as a result of that problem saw her family practitioner the following day. This is not the evidence. It is clear she did not have discomfort in her knee at the time of the accident and did not attend Dr. Lepard the next day because of that condition. The information Dr. Blachut obtained from Ms. Kelly is inconsistent with her evidence at trial and the report of Dr. Lepard\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "89  Secondly, the above statement taints Dr. Blachut's opinion because the time frame he relies on is relevant to his opinion and the issue of causation. It is clear he was led to believe there was immediate pain to the right knee at the time of the accident. This inaccurate premise affects the weight I give to Dr. Blachut's opinion that the accident triggered or accelerated Ms. Kelly's arthritic pain\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "90  In addition to basing his opinion on an inaccurate premise, Dr. Blachut's testimony was somewhat equivocal when he said \"it seemed reasonable, there was an association to some extent.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "91  Finally, Dr. Blachut was asked this question:\n",
      "And you'd also agree with me that she didn't complain of immediate pain in the right knee -- sorry, she didn't tell you she complained of immediate pain in the right knee?\n",
      "A. Yeah, I think that is correct\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "92  This testimony is inconsistent with the history he said he received from Ms. Kelly and contradicts the foundation for his written report. As a result, I am unable to conclude Dr. Blachut's evidence is reliable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "93  In cases such as this involving significant medical issues, it is crucial that the medical evidence be clear, precise and carefully considered in light of the particular facts as they present themselves\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "94  This history as noted by Dr. Blachut is inconsistent with the medical reports and clinical notes of Dr. Lepard. It is clear that when first visiting Dr. Lepard, Ms. Kelly did not complain of any pain in her knee. Whilst it was understandable she was concerned, as she says, about her neck and back because of the prior motor vehicle accident many years earlier, where her soft tissue injuries took six years to resolve, I am satisfied that if she did indeed have any pain to her right knee she would have promptly advised Dr. Lepard of this symptom, contrary to Dr. Travlos' belief as outlined in his September 8, 2010 response to Dr. Leith's report\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "95  Finally, Dr. Blachut confirmed that it is impossible to determine why a person with no prior symptoms of degenerative arthritis can suddenly complain of pain in a particular joint with no traumatic intervention. He testified it can \"just happen for no reason\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "96  The third medical opinion was provided by Dr. Leith. He saw Ms. Kelly on August 11, 2010 and asked her what injuries she had suffered in the accident. Dr. Leith also referred to all of the documentation that was prepared by Dr. Lepard, all of the physiotherapy records, the results of x-rays and an MRI taken of Ms. Kelly's right knee, as well as the operative report of Dr. Blachut after he performed the arthroscopic surgery on Ms. Kelly's right knee\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "97  Dr. Leith testified \"that the records didn't show that there was any knee pain on that day with the family doctor ... and then the patient, during my evaluation, said that there was no knee pain initially either, so that's what I've documented.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "98  Dr. Leith was of the opinion the accident did not cause or trigger the symptoms Ms. Kelly describes because \"there was a delay in symptoms of several days\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "99  Like Dr. Blachut, he confirmed that with osteoarthritis symptoms can occur at any time for no reason at all. As the cartilage thins out, the nerves are exposed to the bone, resulting in pain and swelling of the joint\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "100  In this particular case, after reviewing Dr. Lepard's report and notes, Dr. Leith concluded because there was no evidence of acute injury to the knee at the time of the accident, no immediate pain or bruising and no complaints the following day to Dr. Lepard, the accident did not cause the swelling and pain to her knee\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "101  He stated in his report, \"It is therefore extremely unlikely that the onset of the right knee pain is related to the subject accident. These findings and symptoms were related to the degenerative arthritis of the right knee.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "102  He concluded that it is \"more likely than not\" the pain was caused by the natural progression of the arthritis in her knee. He noted Ms. Kelly had no knee pain on her initial visit to Dr. Lepard. Rather, she advised Dr. Lepard about back, neck and leg discomfort. Dr. Leith testified that \"it is highly unlikely\" the impact of the accident precipitated the onset of the symptoms described by Ms. Kelly because she did not have these symptoms immediately or shortly after impact, nor the next day when she visited Dr. Lepard\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "103  Dr. Leith stated in his report:\n",
      "Ms. Kelly stated during this evaluation that the lateral part of her knee struck the console in the accident. At most, she may have had a minor bruise to this area; however this was not detectable to clinical exam as there was an absence of any sign of swelling or bruising in the clinical records following the subject accident. It is also unlikely that this blow caused irritation to the already arthritic knee since there was a delay in symptoms of several days. If the accident did irritate the already arthritic knee then there would not have been such a delay\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "104  He concluded by stating:\n",
      "The fact that they occurred shortly after the accident with ongoing swelling does not necessarily indicate that the accident was the cause of these symptoms. The symptoms that Ms. Kelly initially presented with were most consistent with a degenerative arthritic knee\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "105  In cross-examination, Dr. Leith acknowledged that if the pain and swelling occurred within a day or two, and if it was where the blow was to the knee, the accident could have triggered her ongoing symptoms\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "106  It is important to consider the hypothetical question that was put to Dr. Leith with respect to whether his opinion would change if there was swelling of the knee \"and focal pain at the medial side of the knee within a day or two of the blow.\" He was asked whether that would change his view \"as to the likelihood of the contribution made to the onset of the symptoms.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "107  When this suggestion was put to him, he replied, \"that is a completely different scenario, yeah\", and in response to the question \"So if that were the case, you would feel differently about it?\", his answer was \"Yeah.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "108  However, Dr. Leith qualified his response by stating:\n",
      "... [I]f there was a mechanism that was consistent with the medial-sided injury and she presented immediately after the accident with swelling and bruising or acute tenderness to that area, that changes things completely\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "109  Counsel for Ms. Kelly then asked this question:\n",
      "And I am putting to you that if the pain and swelling of the knee was abundantly evident within a day or two of the accident, your view then would be that the blow was a contributing factor to the onset of the symptoms\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "110  Dr. Leith replied:\n",
      "Depends where the pain and swelling was. If it was directly over the blow, then, yes. If it was another part of the knee, then it changes. You know, with the same situation of the arthritis and everything, it still -- it's still not conclusive from that standpoint\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "111  The difficulty with the scenario put to Dr. Leith is that Ms. Kelly's evidence is equivocal as to whether within a day or two of the accident her knee was painful and swollen. The accident occurred early in the morning. There is no evidence that there was any difficulty with Ms. Kelly's right knee the next day when she visited Dr. Lepard. Given that in my opinion there is significant uncertainty as to when the pain and swelling occurred in her right knee, as well as the fact that Ms. Kelly says it was the outside or lateral part of her knee that was struck, I am not satisfied that this exchange between counsel and Dr. Leith either undermines his opinion or causes me to reject his evidence in any way\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "112  I appreciate that he did concede that \"if it did contribute, it was minimal contribution, if any.\" In response to that statement, counsel asked, \"How do you measure that?\" Dr. Leith replied:\n",
      "Well, based on the clinical scenario, she's got bad arthritis in her knee. ... So a little blow from a low-speed accident is not going to cause a whole lot of damage. She didn't have any fractures. She didn't have any bruising. She didn't have any major injury. She got out of the car on her own. She walked around. She exchanged information. She continued with her work. So on the spectrum of trauma and disability that we see, that's on the low end of the spectrum\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "113  Finally, counsel put this question to Dr. Leith:\n",
      "I don't quarrel with that, but what I suggest to you is that -- is that it triggered the onset of the admittedly sometime-inevitable symptoms\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "114  Dr. Leith's final response to this was:\n",
      "You know, I don't -- I still think it's coincidental. I don't think it triggered anything, because she didn't have symptoms right after the accident for several days. And so if you take the accident out of the equation and she presented, you know, on the same day to her family doctor with knee pain and swelling, it was because of the arthritis.\n",
      "But just because we put this minor accident into the equation and she shows up five days later with medial compartment pain and swelling, does that mean it's because of this accident? Unlikely. In this clinical -- the context of her presentation, it's unlikely\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "115  Even if I was satisfied the evidence established there was pain to Ms. Kelly's knee within two days, this would not necessarily be sufficient to establish causation. In this regard, Dr. Leith remained of the opinion that it is \"unlikely\" the accident triggered her symptoms because it was the outside of her knee which came into contact with the gear shift but her subsequent pain was on the inside of her knee\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "116  On this point, Dr. Travlos wrote that pain on the inside or medial part of the knee is consistent with osteoarthritis. Pain on the exterior of the knee would be consistent with the outside of her knee hitting the gear shift or console as Ms. Kelly described. His report and evidence supports the conclusion of Dr. Leith with respect to his concerns as to where the pain was occurring. It is logical the pain she described was, as Dr. Leith testified, coincidental with the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "117  I am also cognizant of Dr. Blachut's response to Dr. Leith's opinion, in which he submitted that, depending on the nature of the impact, a lateral blow may be consistent with pathology on the medial side. However, even allowing for the possibility that a blow against the console could cause symptoms to Ms. Kelly's inner knee, I remain satisfied that, as Dr. Leith stated, for causation to be established, some symptoms would have to have been present immediately upon impact\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "118  I appreciate that causation does not have to be proven by scientific evidence or to scientific certainty and that common sense and logic should be uppermost in the court's mind when considering whether or not a motor vehicle incident caused any particular injury\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "119  In dealing with questions of causation, the Supreme Court of Canada said in Athey v. Leonati,  at para. 16:\n",
      "In Snell v. Farrell, , this Court recently confirmed that the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's tortious conduct caused or contributed to the plaintiff's injury. The causation test is not to be applied too rigidly. Causation need not be determined by scientific precision; as Lord Salmon stated in Alphacell Ltd. v. Woodward, [1972] 2 All E.R. 475, at p. 490, and as was quoted by Sopinka J. at p. 328, it is \"essentially a practical question of fact which can best be answered by ordinary common sense\". Although the burden of proof remains with the plaintiff, in some circumstances an inference of causation may be drawn from the evidence without positive scientific proof\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "120  Based on the totality of the evidence, I accept the evidence and opinion of Dr. Leith that if the impact of the collision was the cause of the pain and swelling in Ms. Kelly's right knee, she would have experienced those symptoms at that point in time and certainly prior to seeing Dr. Lepard the next day. She did not. This is consistent with Dr. Blachut's evidence where he says the symptoms she has described would depend on the point of impact and the magnitude of force to her knee\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "121  Whilst I appreciate the logic in Dr. Travlos' opinion that because there were no symptoms before the incident and pain and swelling sometime after the incident, it is reasonable to assume the incident caused the pain and swelling, it is also logical and sensible to conclude as Dr. Leith has that when hitting the gear shift or the console in a significant manner as Ms. Kelly said she did, there would have been an acute injury and immediate pain in that area of the knee. In these circumstances, the evidence has not established on a balance probabilities that the accident \"materially contributed\" to the injury (Athey, para. 15)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "122  For these reasons, I am unable to conclude the plaintiff has proven that the accident caused or accelerated the subsequent pain and swelling she experienced in her arthritic knee.\n",
      "Non-Pecuniary Damage\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "123  As I have already mentioned, counsel suggested the appropriate range for non-pecuniary damages is $20,000.00 to $30,000.00. Counsel cited various authorities regarding the appropriate award of damages. However, most are not helpful given my determination that the right knee symptoms were not caused by the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "124  In Stapley v. Hejslet,  at para. 46, the Court of Appeal set out ten factors that have a bearing on the amount of damages to be awarded for non-pecuniary loss. Having regard to those factors and the cases cited by counsel, I am satisfied the evidence supports an award at the high end of this range. Even though Ms. Kelly's knee has been the primary and ongoing focus of her physiotherapy and rehabilitation, the evidence establishes her soft tissue injuries were reasonably significant and, even excluding the knee injury, affected her activities and lifestyle\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "125  In written argument, Mr. Hood submitted that Ms. Kelly's soft tissue injuries were resolved by December 2009, approximately 18 months after the accident. I accept this as accurate\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "126  There will therefore be judgement for non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $30,000.00.\n",
      "Loss of Earning Capacit\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "127  Ms. Kelly's claim for loss of earning capacity is based on her ongoing knee problems. Counsel for Ms. Kelly submits that \"but for her knee injury she would have no trouble getting work as a regional or district manager\". As I have concluded the accident did not trigger the symptoms of arthritis in Ms. Kelly's knee, she is not entitled to damages under this head.\n",
      "Mitigatio\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "128  The defendants submitted Ms. Kelly failed to mitigate her damages by not accepting employment with her employer Fields Stores in Toronto. I am not satisfied the defendant has established a failure to mitigate because she does not wish to relocate to Toronto at this stage of her life. She is 63 years of age. Her family and grandchildren live here. Her husband has a business she helps out with. She is actively seeking employment in this area with the assistance of vocational experts. The decision not to relocate to Toronto is a reasonable one\n",

      "A. Prior to the Accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "4  Ms. Langille was born in Nova Scotia in May 1960 and was 52 years of age at the time of the trial. When she was young, her family moved to Campbell River on Vancouver Island, where she attended high school. She did not finish Grade 12\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "5  In 1978, she took some courses at North Island College for a few months. She then began working at a financial institution, where she worked for many years until the late 1980s\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "6  In 1988, Ms. Langille began a relationship with Drew Drewoth. Shortly thereafter, she began working with Mr. Drewoth in his construction job, which involved supplying and installing stucco. Although this was very heavy work, Ms. Langille worked long hours in this business. This business ended after some 12 years\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "7  In 1999, Ms. Langille temporarily moved to Alert Bay on Vancouver Island to look after the affairs of her ailing mother. There, she held down three jobs. She looked after a rental cabin business, worked as a cashier at a grocery store, and bartended at the Legion. Around the same time, Ms. Langille's relationship with Mr. Drewoth began to fail, although she returned to live with him in Gibsons, B.C. and then Burnaby, B.C. while continuing in the stucco business\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "8  Between June and October 2002, Ms. Langille and Mr. Drewoth moved to Edmonton, where Ms. Langille held down two jobs, working in a data centre and as a bartender. Later that same year, they moved back to the Lower Mainland and lived together in North Vancouver until April 2003\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "9  In March 2003, Ms. Langille secured a position at Securicor (now known as G4S plc). Securicor is in the business of processing cash from various sources, including banks, grocery stores and the like. Securicor also supplies cash to those same businesses and handles bank machines all over the Lower Mainland\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "10  Ms. Langille's first position at Securicor was in the \"cash cage\", which involves processing deposits from various sources, including verifying the bags of cash delivered. This involved handling fairly heavy bags of cash, in the range of 15 to 20 pounds, and pushing tubs of cash around. There was also some stationary activity. Her co-worker, Marie Viani, described Ms. Langille as friendly, energetic and fun to be with\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "11  Ms. Langille, consistent with her early history, obtained a second job. In April 2003, she began working afternoon shifts at a beer and wine store associated with the Squarerigger Pub in West Vancouver. She would work six-hour shifts on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. She also acted as a bartender in the pub from time to time on Friday and Saturday nights\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "12  She says that she worked so hard in order to fulfill her dream of saving enough money to move to the Okanagan and buy a condominium and enjoy a better climate. She says that her second job was her \"savings account\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "13  Ms. Langille obtained her own apartment in North Vancouver in the spring of 2004, as her relationship with Mr. Drewoth came to a close\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "14  Prior to December 2004, Ms. Langille had no physical injuries arising from her various jobs. She describes herself as very active prior to this time. She says that she was an avid walker and that she enjoyed camping, hiking, river rafting, riding bikes and gardening. She says that she also enjoyed being active with her girlfriends. She would organize \"girls' nights out\" with her friends, including Ms. Viani, which involved dancing and karaoke.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  Ms. Langille was driving her Nissan Pulsar home at around 6:30 pm after working a shift at the Squarerigger Pub. She was travelling eastbound on Marine Drive in North Vancouver after having stopped at Capilano Road. She says that Mr. Nguyen's vehicle came out of nowhere and cut across her lane of travel. Mr. Nguyen confirmed that he was crossing the eastbound Marine Drive lanes for the purpose of turning left onto that street. Despite slamming on her brakes, Ms. Langille T-boned his car. She described the impact as \"pretty hard\". Mr. Nguyen agreed, calling it a big collision and a significant impact\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  As a result of the accident, Ms. Langille went forward then slammed into the headrest of her seat. She did not lose consciousness. Mr. Nguyen's car was written off.\n",
      " 2. Aftermath\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  As luck would have it, some ambulance attendants were at the gas station kitty corner to the accident scene. They immediately attended to her. One attendant held her head while the driver's door was crowbarred open. She was placed on a stretcher and taken to Lion's Gate Hospital. At that time, she felt pain in her neck and lower back and she had a headache. After x-rays, she was sent home with some Tylenol 3\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  The following day, she felt very stiff and sore and had a bad headache. She visited her family doctor, who diagnosed injuries to her shoulder, low back and neck. She was prescribed muscle relaxants and painkillers\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "20  She was off work at Securicor for about a month before undergoing a graduated return to work. She did not return to the Squarerigger Pub until February 2005, but even then she considered that she could not do the heavy lifting that was required of that job. Her last shift there was in November 2005. She says that she has been unable to hold down any second job since that time, due to what she considers are her physical limitations. She says that she was unable to do any of the required lifting of boxes or kegs at the pub and beer and wine store\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "21  She describes her injuries as relating to her neck, her left shoulder, between the shoulder blades (like \"razor blade cuts\"), and her lower back. She also had headaches\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "22  Ms. Langille's treatment consisted of physiotherapy, as recommended by her doctor, from January to April 2005. Those sessions were two or three times per week. She also tried massage therapy three times a week over that same time frame. Thereafter, Ms. Langille completed certain exercises at home and continued her walking routines. Further, she took prescription and then over-the-counter medications from January to April 2005\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "23  Ms. Langille says that she started to feel better by the spring/summer of 2005. She was walking every day and was happy to return to work. She saw a medical practitioner (Dr. Quirke) for treatment when needed, which was maybe only once a month. Aside from a massage session in 2009, she did not require any physiotherapy or massage treatment in the four years preceding the second accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  Her co-worker, Matthew Stewart, described her during this time as happy and bubbly, with a smile on her face\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "25  Later, in early 2006, Ms. Langille obtained a new position with Securicor in the turret and equipment room. This position was largely stationary and involved monitoring access of people and trucks, answering phones and data entry\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  In 2006, Ms. Langille met Ron Dooris, who was also an employee of Securicor working on Vancouver Island. Mr. Dooris lives in Campbell River. They began seeing each other regularly and they would typically visit each other twice a month, taking turns travelling between North Vancouver and Campbell River for a weekend. Ms. Langille did not feel that the first accident affected their relationship at all at this time\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  In early 2007, Ms. Langille was trained at Securicor to work on the armored trucks. She asked for this change due to the higher wage. This position involved carrying a firearm (a .38 Special after she obtained a license in November 2007). She was also qualified originally to carry and operate a shotgun, which was required in the event of a long haul of cash\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  Securicor operates on a 24/7 basis and has both day and night shifts. Ms. Langille considered that the daytime work was easier since the loads of cash were lighter. However, she generally liked the night shifts, which involved dealing with night safes and bank machines, because there was less traffic and the work was more interesting and faster paced. She particularly emphasized that working on the bank machines in the evening was more difficult because she had to kneel down to get the cash and then lift the cash out\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  By December 2009, some five years later, Ms. Langille said that her neck and mid back were about 70% recovered. She still had neck problems that caused pain when she was watching TV, reading or driving, including doing shoulder checks. She was also still getting a razor blade feeling between her shoulder blades. Her lower back was about 80% recovered. She had few problems with her left shoulder by this time.\n",

      "32  The bridge has three northbound lanes, and it is accepted that the bridge rises to a crest or midpoint after which it slopes down towards the North Shore. The entrance to the bridge from McGill Street is a long on-ramp. It eventually becomes a third lane on the far right or outside lane on the bridge\n",

      "34  Ms. Langille says that she was in the middle lane and that Mr. Kitada was to the right of her as they went over the bridge. She wanted to get in the right lane. As she was shoulder-checking, she says, Mr. Kitada \"cut her off\" by moving into her lane without notice. Despite Ms. Langille slamming on her brakes, she rear-ended Mr. Kitada\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  Mr. Kitada says that after he entered the highway from the McGill Street entrance, he moved into the middle lane of travel. He says that sometime after reaching the crest of the bridge, he noticed police lights flashing and a traffic jam in front of him. He says he was rear-ended by Ms. Langille while he was slowing down\n",

      "37  Ms. Langille says that she was angry about the collision. She got out of her vehicle, approached Mr. Kitada and yelled at him. He did not respond. He was preoccupied with picking up certain shopping bags and their contents, which had been ejected from his trunk onto the road behind his vehicle\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  Ms. Langille turned her car off when she got out of her vehicle, although she says that she left the interior lights on in her car. She says that there was lots of light. Indeed, there are street lights spaced over the entire span of the bridge. While speaking with Mr. Kitada, she realized that they would need to exchange the usual information, so she returned to her vehicle, which remained stationary in the middle lane. With the door slightly ajar, she got into the driver's seat and proceeded to reach across the car to the glove box for her insurance papers\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  She did not move her car after the collision, nor did she activate her emergency lights at any time, even though she obviously realized that she was in the middle lane of the highway. She thought that cars had lots of room to go around her and Mr. Kitada's car\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "40  While reaching across to the glove box, her vehicle was hit from behind by a vehicle being driven by the defendant, Hailey Marchant\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "41  The impact was severe. Ms. Langille's car was completely turned around by the collision. Mr. Kitada, who was still picking up his bags, was pinned between his vehicle and that of Mr. Langille, as the latter was forced forward by the impact. Ms. Langille recalls only a loud boom and everything going black. She awoke on a stretcher as she was being transported to the emergency room at Lion's Gate Hospital. She would remain there for the next four days\n",

      "42  Ms. Marchant says that she was travelling in the middle lane on the bridge. Just after she had reached the crest of the bridge, she noticed red and blue flashing lights at the north end of the bridge. Immediately thereafter, she noticed Ms. Langille's car stopped in the middle of the road. She immediately applied her brakes and attempted to swerve to the right, but failed to avoid a collision. She hit Ms. Langille's vehicle's right back side while travelling at a fairly high rate of speed\n",

      "44  In my view, the issues surrounding the accident involving Mr. Kitada and Ms. Langille are not relevant to the determination of the issues in these actions. Ms. Langille discontinued her action against Mr. Kitada, so it is not necessary to decide who was at fault in respect of the first collision. Further, I consider that the two collisions were separate events. Accordingly, while the two accidents occurred within a timespan of only a few minutes, it is possible to determine the liability for the second accident without making any such determination for the first accident.\n",

      "45  Ms. Langille's injuries from the second impact in the second motor vehicle accident were severe. They included a broken nose; a fracture of her C7 vertebrae; a torn rotator cuff on the left side; bruising in the rib cage, back and left leg (from hitting the steering wheel); and a right foot sprain. She was required to wear a neck brace. She had black eyes and stitches on her nose. She was on soft foods at the hospital and had to take morphine for the pain\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "46  In the days and weeks following the accident, Ms. Langille required extensive assistance. Her boyfriend, Mr. Dooris, and his relatives collected her at the hospital and took her home. In the immediate time frame, Mr. Dooris attended to all her needs and cared for her. This included bathing and feeding her, doing the grocery shopping, and helping her with personal care. This took about eight to ten hours per day. Ms. Viani also helped in this time frame with buying groceries, feeding her, doing household chores, and helping her shower. Initially, she went about five days a week for a couple of hours a day; after a month, she went once a week for a couple of hours\n",

Ms. Langille returned to her home in North Vancouver in early January 2010 for a medical appointment with the neurosurgeon. She was advised to continue wearing the neck brace for three months and to rest. She continued on medication, including morphine. She obtained some at-home care for cooking and cleaning\n",

She says that she was travelling about 50-60 km/hour, which is well below the speed limit on the bridge. After merging from the McGill Street on-ramp, she moved to the middle lane. As she crested the bridge, she noticed the flashing lights at the north end of the bridge and glanced over quickly. She then noticed the vehicles of Ms. Langille and Mr. Kitada stopped in the middle lane. She estimates that the cars were between six and ten car lengths away from the crest of the bridge\n",

      "71  Ms. Marchant did not notice any brake lights from Ms. Langille's vehicle, which is consistent with Ms. Langille's evidence that she only had her running lights on. Only after around two seconds from first noticing Ms. Langille's vehicle did she realize that the vehicles were not moving. She braked and turned to the right to attempt to avoid a collision, but she hit the back right side of Ms. Langille's vehicle\n",

      "72  There are difficulties reconciling Ms. Marchant's evidence that she had no time to stop through no fault of her own after she saw that the vehicles were stopped. She candidly admitted at discovery that \"it was too fast. I was too close. I didn't see it soon enough\". But it begs the question: why could she not have at least slowed down more to lessen the impact\n",

      "76  Ms. Langille suggests that it is impossible for Ms. Marchant to have slowed down in these circumstances and yet still cause the significant damage that was done to Ms. Langille's vehicle. Ms. Marchant still says that there was \"little time\" or \"almost no time at all\" to stop. Ms. Marchant's position is premised on the theory that the crest of the bridge is so steep that she could not see the northern half until after passing the crest of the bridge\n",
      "======\n",

      "77  While I appreciate that the view would be somewhat restricted until reaching the crest, absolutely no reconstruction evidence was presented by Ms. Marchant in support of her view that she could not see the obstruction until after that point and that she had no way to stop before hitting the stopped vehicles further along the road\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "78  In my view, the most reliable evidence as to the location of the stopped vehicles comes from both Mr. Kitada and Ms. Langille. Both clearly stated that their vehicles came to rest some ways along the northern end of the bridge, well after the crest. I find as a fact that the vehicles were stopped approximately three-quarters of the way across the bridge\n",

      "\n",
      "83  Further, at the time of the accident, she only had an \"N\" or new driver designation, although she had been driving under that designation for some years. She was in violation of that designation by having more than one other person in the vehicle. Having more people than is allowed may have contributed to her being distracted. Ms. Marchant did not call the two friends that were in her car that evening, and although they were said to be intoxicated, it is possible that one or both of them might have been able to give evidence to illuminate what happened that night. I draw an adverse inference that their evidence would not have been helpful to Ms. Marchant's case\n",
      "======\n",

      "84  Notably, Ms. Marchant was ticketed by the police for driving without due care and attention, pursuant to s. 144(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 318 and she paid it without dispute. She also failed the breathalyzer test administered at the time, despite her contention that she had only one glass of wine some three to four hours beforehand. There is no evidence about what the reading was or why she may have failed it. Although she may not have been intoxicated to any degree, consumption of alcohol could have contributed to her inattention\n",

      "85  Ms. Langille contends that Ms. Marchant is wholly to blame for the collision, citing the principles from McKee v. Malenfant,  (S.C.C.). In that case, the plaintiff struck a vehicle which had been negligently left running by the defendant on the side of the road. Mr. Justice Kellock, for the majority, rejected the argument that the defendant was contributorily negligent, stating at 788:\n",
      "... Whether or not there was a driver who remained in the truck, there was continuing negligence in the continuing presence of the truck on the road, but it is well settled in cases of this kind that where a clear line can be drawn between the negligence of plaintiff and defendant, it is not a case of contributory negligence at all. This case may therefore be disposed of upon the first ground upon which the learned trial judge disposed of it, namely, that after the respondent saw the vehicle in his path, he had plenty of opportunity to avoid it but failed to do so\n",

The court stated that \"[i]n rear-end collisions, a heavy burden rests upon the driver of the overtaking vehicle\": para. 14. The court found that the vehicle was plainly visible and that the plaintiff could have stopped in time to avoid the collision. The plaintiff's negligence was found to be the sole cause of the collision despite the defendant's negligence: paras. 13-15\n",

Ms. Marchant has satisfied me that she faced rather difficult conditions that night on the bridge, which included the somewhat restricted view arising from the crest of the bridge, the dark conditions, and the state of Ms. Langille's vehicle (which I will discuss in more detail below). I accept that she did her best to stop her vehicle once she put her mind to what was in front of her\n",

Accidents happen, and it is rarely the case that one has sufficient foresight to ensure that the immediate result does not cause a hazard to other users of the road. Conversely, motorists are intuitively aware that accidents happen and that they may be required to take defensive or evasive action to avoid such hazards. Accordingly, even if Ms. Langille was at fault for the collision with Mr. Kitada, there was a sufficient lapse of time leading to the second collision to assess these matters separately\n",

      "90  The central allegation regarding the second accident is that Ms. Langille was at fault because she failed to move her vehicle to the side of the road and failed to engage her emergency flashing lights to better identify the presence of her vehicle to northbound bridge traffic. Ms. Marchant also says that Ms. Langille could have physically moved to the pedestrian walkway on the side of the bridge to avoid any risks arising out of remaining in the middle of the bridge. Ms. Marchant says that Ms. Langille should be assessed between 80-100% responsibility for the collision\n",

In that case, the defendant had collided with a moose, throwing it into the oncoming lane. The defendant stopped his vehicle. He attempted to turn on his hazard lights without success. The plaintiff, who was traveling in the same direction, suddenly came upon the defendant's unlit vehicle and swerved into the southbound lane in an attempt to avoid colliding with the defendant's vehicle. Even so, he struck the moose and suffered injuries as a result\n",

      "\n",
      "92  The court found the defendant was not negligent in striking the moose, as he was traveling safely given the road conditions. However, the court accepted the plaintiff's argument that, following the collision with the moose, the defendant was under a duty to take steps to warn other vehicles of the hazard:\n",
      "[37] The driver of a motor car on a highway is under a duty to conduct himself in a manner that does not, by his fault in the management of himself or his car, expose other users of the highway to unnecessary risk of harm. He is at fault, whether in emergencies or in ordinary circumstances, when he fails to exercise the reasonable care, skill or self-possession that the attendant circumstances require: see Sinclair v. Nyehold  at 618 (B.C.C.A.).\n",
      "[38] Mr. Horianopoulos' stationary truck and the moose carcass constituted a hazard to other vehicles. I find that Mr. Horianopoulos had a duty to take reasonable care under the circumstances to warn passing motorists. The standard is objective. Therefore, although he was, according to the testimony of both parties, injured and in shock, he remained under a duty to take reasonable steps in the circumstances.\n",
      "[39] Apart from attempting to put on the truck's hazard lights, he took no other steps. He did not ensure that the truck's lights were on; he did not move the truck off to the shoulder. A driver exercising reasonable self-possession in the circumstances would have taken such steps. Accordingly, Mr. Horianopoulos' conduct was negligent\n",

      "94  This accident occurred around 11:00 pm. It was dark out. Although Ms. Langille suggested that there was sufficient lighting along the bridge to illuminate matters, the fact is that the lights are staggered and do not necessarily illuminate stopped cars in areas between the lights. For example, there was no evidence that the stopped cars were close to one of the light standards. In addition, other lights on the bridge, both oncoming and ahead, would of necessity be a distraction that would increase the risk of not seeing a stopped car\n",

In accordance with s. 68(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Act, the parties were obliged to exchange information. It is questionable, however, that one has to remain at the scene where the risk to yourself, your vehicle and others coming behind you is in issue. Section 68(1)(a) refers to a \"return\" to the scene, and presumably the parties could agree to pull off to a safe area to complete the exchange or otherwise exchange the information in the safe pedestrian area.

As such, if the vehicles were moved to the outside lane near the concrete abutment, Ms. Langille would have also been at risk of being hit by drivers travelling in that lane of travel. In my view, however, this action would have, at least, lessened the risk of collision and certainly, in hindsight, would have avoided this particular collision. I find as a fact that Ms. Langille could have driven her car to the side of the bridge after the collision with Mr. Kitada.

The defendant, Cade, was driving across a bridge when she experienced an anxiety attack. She engaged her hazard lights and slowed her vehicle. Once she realized the vehicle behind her was also slowing, she brought her vehicle to a stop in the travelled portion of the road, even though she could have pulled over close to the concrete abutment. The vehicle behind driven by the defendant, MacBurney, came to a stop, but failed to engage its hazard lights and was struck from behind by the plaintiff on a motorcycle\n",

He found that she was negligent \"in failing to recognize the importance of pulling over as close to the concrete abutment as possible, so as to reduce the risk to other drivers\": para. 110. He similarly found the second defendant to have fallen below the standard of care in failing to engage his hazard lights when coming to a stop on the roadway: paras. 111-12. Lastly, he found that the plaintiff, Baker, did not satisfy the onus of showing that he was not at fault, since he had an unobstructed view of the vehicles and he could have turned to avoid the collision: paras. 113-18\n",

Shortly thereafter, while travelling the speed limit, the plaintiff approached the intersection in the same lane the stalled truck was in. The car ahead of the plaintiff's suddenly changed lanes, revealing the stalled truck ahead of her, although she initially thought it was just moving slowly. She then made attempts but was unable to move into her right-hand lane due to traffic. It was only at that point that she realized the truck was stationary. She hit her brakes, but to no avail. The trial judge found the defendant negligent in not taking any precautions to either move his truck or warn oncoming traffic of the hazard. The judge found the plaintiff was also negligent in not taking more time to assess the rate at which she was gaining on the defendant's vehicle before checking her mirrors to see if she was able to move into the right-hand lane.

Knowing that there was a ditch just off the road, he was careful not to pull over too far to the right, as he could not see where the road ended due to the dense fog. He neglected to activate his hazard lights. He got out of his vehicle to inspect the truck when the defendant struck the truck from behind. The court found that the plaintiff's truck was fully in the travelled portion of the roadway at the time of the collision.

In addition, the driver of the plaintiff's vehicle was also negligent because he was driving too fast for the road conditions.

If Ms. Langille had activated her emergency flashers, the fact that the cars were stopped would have immediately been apparent. Ms. Langille provided no explanation why she did not do this simple task beyond that she did not think about it. I appreciate that she was upset about the collision with Mr. Kitada.

Even though there may be several tortious and non-tortious causes of injury, so long as the defendant's act is a cause of the plaintiff's damage, the defendant is fully liable for that damage.

He concluded that the first accident caused soft tissue injuries and was the most likely cause of Ms. Langille's neck, low back and hip strain. In addition, Dr. Tarazi noted certain bulges at C5/C6 and C6/C7, which were pre-existing but aggravated by the accident. A protrusion at C4/C5 was either caused or aggravated by the accident, causing neck pain. Dr. Tarazi opined that Ms. Langille's disabilities would improve to a certain extent over time, but they would limit her physical activity now and in the future. He described her pain as \"chronic\".\n",
      "Dr. Peter Joy, a registered psychologist: Dr. Joy examined Ms. Langille on August 19, 2009. He concluded that Ms. Langille was suffering from a Pain and Adjustment Disorder that was most prevalent in the spring of 2007. He stated that the strongest contributor towards that condition was the motor vehicle accident and the consequences of that accident. He acknowledged, however, that her separation from Mr. Drewoth was also a contributing factor. Further, Dr. Joy acknowledged that Ms. Langille is typically depressed on a seasonal basis in the early winter months, a matter that Ms. Langille conceded. As a result, he concluded that these disorders were \"in partial remission\". At the time of assessment, she was not significantly depressed or anxious and she had no active Pain Disorder. Dr. Joy described her as doing \"quite well\". Her prognosis relating to emotional matters was favourable and no treatment was recommended.

Dr. Loomer diagnosed soft tissue injuries to the upper part of Ms. Langille's spine and the base of her neck. He suspected that this was the cause of her headaches.

      "Dr. Alexander Levin, a psychiatrist: Dr. Levin saw Ms. Langille on November 7, 2012.

      "Her chief complaint was that she was \"more depressed and stressed for the past few months\". Her sleep was \"very interrupted\" and she was \"stressed out\", although she reported that she had a \"good relationship with her partner\". Ms. Langille reported that she had \"chronic\" lower back pain, yet she had \"not been doing her exercise program for this\". Ms. Langille indicated that she had stopped her Zoloft a year prior and wanted to resume. Dr. Paetkau recommended physiotherapy for an exercise program for her back and prescribed Zoloft (September 15, 2000).\n",

This includes Dr. Paetkau's prescription on September 15, 2000 and Dr. Martz's prescription on November 18, 2004 for Zoloft.

Dr. Martz also rejected the suggested on cross examination that the reference to alcoholism could have referred to Mr. Drewoth and not Ms. Langille in light of the fact that Ms. Langille denied any such problems in the past. Dr. Paetkau acknowledged that low back pain is a symptom of pelvic inflammatory disease, which was diagnosed during the September 15, 2000 examination.

Although he did not consider Dr. Paetkau's reports in his report, he similarly dismissed that this was a clinical diagnosis of depression. He considered that the symptoms of depression before the 2004 accident were not as severe as after. Dr. Joy similarly dismissed these prior records as having particular relevance. Both doctors also placed little significance on Ms. Langille's extensive history of prescription medication for depression\n",

      "143  Dr. Parhar also indicated in his opinion of September 4, 2012 that the 2004 accident has caused a \"mild traumatic brain injury/concussion syndrome\" by reason of her hitting her head on the head rest and her subsequent report that she felt \"dazed\". This was said to be impacting her concentration. He recommended further neurological assessment. Dr. Parhar relied in part on the earlier opinion of Dr. Quirke in a medical legal opinion that was not put into evidence. Ms. Langille takes the position that Dr. Parhar was entitled to rely on Dr. Quirke's opinion and that it would only affect what weight might be placed on that conclusion: Klimchuk v.

      "147  The first major point of contention arose from Dr. Parhar's diagnosis of traumatic brain injury, which injury was not evident on the MRI.

In any event, Ms. Langille does not contend that she suffered a brain injury that affected her ongoing abilities. She says that it was not significant and that she recovered from this injury.

It is well taken that Dr. Parhar's expertise was not in the psychological/psychiatric field. Dr. Joy, a psychologist, and Dr. Levin, a psychiatrist, testified for Ms. Langille and the defence, respectively. Dr. Joy testified that when he saw Ms. Langille in 2009, she was not depressed and that her mood seemed normal. Dr. Levin concluded that she did not develop any new major mental illness as a result of the first accident. Ms. Langille agrees that depression was not a factor arising from the first accident.

He concluded that the second and third accidents further damaged Ms. Langille's neck, low back, and hips. In addition, they caused injuries to her knee and left shoulder. He again described her condition as suffering from \"chronic pain\". Her C7 neck fracture had healed. Dr. Tarazi considered that she was totally disabled for about seven months after the second accident and that she had partially recovered by the time of the third accident. Following the third accident, she was disabled for a period of one week, and is now partially disabled on a permanent basis due to the injuries sustained in all three accidents. Dr. Tarazi opined that her depression and chronic pain was a \"significant\" aspect of her problems as of late 2012 and recommended that she see a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n",
      "Dr. Joy examined Ms. Langille again on October 1, 2012, almost three years after the second accident and almost two years after the third accident. He concluded that Ms. Langille's pain, anxiety and depression had increased significantly. He diagnosed her as suffering from a Pain Disorder, which diagnosis assumed both a physical and psychological contribution to pain. Since his last report, he found that there was reported and measured disability related to pain, together with increased anxiety and depressive symptomatology. There was no diagnosis of any anxiety or depression disorder. Dr. Joy stated that, in his opinion, the combined effect of the second and third accidents had brought on more severe psychological symptoms and impairments. Dr. Joy stated that this condition had become \"chronic\". A cure was not expected.\n",
      "Dr. Parhar found that Ms. Langille had decreased range of motion in her cervical and lumbar spine. Dr. Parhar agreed with Dr. Tarazi's previous diagnosis that Ms. Langille's injuries to her neck and back area were caused by the motor vehicle accidents.

      "\n",
      "153  I find that Ms. Langille suffered the following injuries -- and aggravation of injuries -- in both the second and third accidents:\n",
      "She suffered a C7 fracture, which has increased the risk of osteoarthritis.\n",
      "She broke her nose. It healed after a couple of months, although she still has a scar that she considers a blemish.\n",
      "She suffered a right-ankle sprain, but it was fully healed in a couple of months.\n",
      "She injured her knee. It resolved quickly, although there remain unsightly broken veins that cause her some concern.\n",
      "Her abdominal bruising was sore and tender for several months.\n",
      "Her left shoulder was very painful in the first couple of months, causing her to avoid sleep on the left side. Ms. Langille still describes significant restriction in moving her arm and shoulder, which affects her ability to complete certain personal care tasks.\n",
      "Her headaches lasted for six months and lessened after that time. Now, she only gets them a couple of times per month and they last for a few hours. She takes over-the-counter pain medication for them.\n",
      "She suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck, back and hip areas, which remain painful to this day. Although Ms. Langille had back problems before the first accident, which were no doubt related to the quite physical work she was doing at the time, they did not impair Ms. Langille's function at that time or even after. I accept Dr. Tarazi's evidence that the back pain now suffered by Ms. Langille arises from the accidents.\n",
      "She suffered various symptomology arising from the accidents: difficulty sleeping; very moody and irritable; depression; little energy outside of work; and difficulty concentrating and memory problems. As noted above, there is a difference of opinion as to whether Ms. Langille has a Pain Disorder (per Dr. Joy) or is simply experiencing stressors arising from the accidents that is not a Pain Disorder (per Dr. Levin). In my view, it is not necessary to resolve this medical debate. I accept Ms. Langille's evidence that she is experiencing these symptoms and that they arise from the motor vehicle accidents. Despite Ms. Langille having had depression symptoms in the past, these clearly arose in the circumstances of her unfortunate relationship with Mr. Drewoth, which has been over for some time. I accept Dr. Joy's report that this symptomology, including the depression, arises from the physical pain which Ms. Langille continues to experience to this day (per the report of Dr. Tarazi). The comments of the court in Smusz v. Wolfe Chevrolet Ltd.,  are apposite:\n",
      "[91] While she had suffered brief episodes of depression in the past, I am satisfied they were reactive depressions and were fully resolved at the time of the accident. I have no doubt that because she has suffered depression in the past, she was vulnerable to depression, but she is the thin-skulled plaintiff here rather than a crumbling skull plaintiff. ..\n",

      "\n",
      "155  I also accept Dr. Levin's opinion that while Ms. Langille may have experienced a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in the second accident, she suffered no long-term cognitive, psychological or emotional consequences from that injury.\n",

      "156  Non-pecuniary damages are awarded to compensate the plaintiff for pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of amenities. The compensation awarded should be fair to all parties, and fairness is measured against awards made in comparable cases. Such cases, though helpful, serve only as a rough guide. Each case depends on its own unique facts: Trites v. Penner,  at paras. 188-189\n",

      "severity and duration of pain;\n",
      "disability;\n",
      "emotional suffering; and\n",

      "She suffered soft tissue injuries in the first accident and was off work for a month. She completed a rehabilitation program over approximately five months, after which she felt substantially better. She continued to have some symptoms over the next five years leading to the second accident.\n",
      "Ms. Langille suffered more severe injuries in the second accident. In addition to broken bones, she suffered soft tissue injuries. All these injuries resulted in her being significantly disabled during the months following the accident. She returned to work after approximately six months on a graduated return to work program and was back at regular duties two months after that. She underwent physiotherapy sessions. She continues to suffer from symptoms to this day, notably chronic pain in her neck, back and hip. She also has shoulder problems.\n",
      "Ms. Langille's injuries from the second accident were exacerbated by the third accident, which occurred only eight months later. She only missed a few days off work and she recommenced physiotherapy sessions.\n",
      "Ms. Langille remains partially disabled to this day, in large part due to her chronic pain, which in turn has caused certain psychological or emotional issues.\n",
      "Ms. Langille has gone from an active, fun-loving person to someone who is more sedentary and reserved. This change of personality has been noted by her co-worker, Mr. Stewart, her friends, Ms. Viani and Ms. Stubbs, and her partner, Mr. Dooris. Her injuries have affected her ability to care for herself. They have also affected her personal relationship with Mr. Dooris.\n",
      "Finally, I consider that Ms. Langille has showed considerable stoicism in the face of her medical problems\n",

In the first, she sustained soft tissue injuries to her neck, shoulders, back, hips, upper arms and legs. She experienced headaches, dizziness, and numbness in her left arm and hand. The second accident intensified her neck and back pain and led to chronic pain. In addition to the physical injuries, the plaintiff experienced intense anxiety, symptoms of depression and symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"). She had become totally disabled and could not work. The court awarded damages at $120,000.\n",
      "Marois v. Pelech, : A formerly active 49-year-old single mother and restaurant worker suffered a musculoligamentous strain to her neck, mid back and low back. She went on to develop a chronic myofascial pain condition and significant anxiety and depressive symptoms. Her full and busy life was lost to her over the six years prior to trial, and would continue to be impacted. Her prospects for further improvement were found to be uncertain. The court upheld the award of $130,000.\n",
      "Morlan v. Barrett, : A 46-year-old plaintiff was injured in two motor vehicle accidents on January 6, 2007. The first accident was a head-on collision; the second was a rear-end collision.

      "Fox v. Danis, : A plaintiff sought damages arising from the permanent injuries to her neck and lower back. These injuries had an adverse effect on the plaintiff's quality of life. She was in pain every day and was unable to get a full night's sleep due to the pain. There was a realistic likelihood that she would become depressed as a result of the chronic pain. The plaintiff was awarded $100,000.\n",
      "Rizzottti v. Doe, : The 49-year-old plaintiff suffered injuries to her left leg, hip and lower back. She also had severe bruising across her neck, chest and abdomen.

The court awarded $110,000.\n",
      "Zawadzki v. Calimoso, : It was the evidence of all the experts that the plaintiff, a 44-year-old automotive technician, had suffered a significant injury to his elbow, causing osteoarthritic changes that were likely to progress. He was also found to be suffering from significant and continuing disabling back pain. His injuries were found to have fundamentally changed his ability to engage in activities that previously gave him pleasure. As a result, he suffered from depression, anxiety and alcoholism.

      "163  For a global assessment, the defence cites Caldwell v. Ignas, . In that case, the plaintiff was injured in an accident, including fracturing one or two vertebrae in his upper back. He also had soft tissue injuries to his neck and mid back. He was found to have suffered chronic pain and permanent injuries. The court found that the injuries resulted in restrictions in the capacity to perform a number of specific functions, to participate in various activities, and to enjoy a quality of life that he had prior to the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "164  On a global basis, I am satisfied that an award of $110,000 would be appropriate. Given my conclusion that Ms. Langille is contributorily negligent in respect of the second collision, however, it is necessary to award individual sums in respect of the three accidents. I would note, in any event, that some injuries, such as the fracture of Ms. Langille's C7 vertebrae, are only attributable to the second accident\n",

      "170  The burden of proof of actual past events is on a balance of probabilities. An assessment of loss of both past and future earning capacity also involves the consideration of hypothetical events.

She also lost $842.88 in wages during her graduated return to work. Accordingly, following the first motor vehicle accident, she lost wages at Securicor totalling $3,673.71 gross/$3,067.55 net\n",

      "\n",
      "175  The main dispute between the parties relates to Ms. Langille's claim for past income loss of $75,000. This claim arises from her contention that but for the first accident, she would have continued to work her second job at the Squarerigger Pub while working for Securicor or alternatively, she would have worked more overtime with Securicor\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "176  Ms. Langille's history demonstrates that she typically had a variety of jobs at one time. She had a number of jobs while working in Alert Bay and in Edmonton.

In that report, Darren Benning sets out a calculation of income loss for the period from December 19, 2004 to December 30, 2012. By that calculation, he has assumed that Ms. Langille would have continued working at the pub in addition to her job at Securicor. Mr. Benning calculates that her estimated loss was $80,557 from the pub and $52,799 from Securicor, for a total of $91,577 net of taxes and Employment Insurance (EI)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "179  In response, however, the defence makes the compelling argument that it is not likely that Ms. Langille would have continued with her bartending job. The defence says that Ms. Langille stopped working at the Squarerigger Pub for two reasons: first, she did not need to work two jobs because she was making enough money at Securicor to meet her needs; and second, her schedule at Securicor did not allow her to continue working at the pub. Both arguments have merit in my view\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "180  The evidence demonstrates that when Ms. Langille returned to B.C. in 2002, she was anxious to obtain employment to pay her bills. Her past jobs had all been fairly low paying jobs\n",

      "\n",
      "181  During 2003 and 2004, when she had both jobs, she was earning approximately $3,000-$3,200 per month, which she considered was sufficient to meet her needs. The 2003 payroll records from Securicor show that she was making $11 per hour when she started and that her monthly earnings were rarely over $2,300. During that same time frame, she was making $9 per hour working at the pub and earning approximately $800 per month\n",

      "\n",
      "183  After the time off work immediately after the first accident, Ms. Langille continued working at both jobs and worked almost the same number of hours that she had been working previously. Thus, Ms. Langille asserts this income loss not on the basis that she continued working the same hours, but that she had difficulty in completing her more physical tasks at the pub due to her injuries. The question then becomes, did she continue to have a need to work such that she would have chosen to work at the pub in any event\n",
      "======\n",

      "185  She testified that by the time she stopped working at the pub, she was very happy with her job at Securicor. Importantly, she knew that there were opportunities for advancement within Securicor, and that her income was increasing and would continue to increase\n",

      "186  Ms. Langille's hourly rate at Securicor increased over the years after the first accident: $11 per hour in March 2003 to $13.89 per hour at the end of 2005; various rates in the $14 to $17 range throughout 2006; $15 to $18 per hour in 2007; $15 to $23 per hour in 2008; $17 to $24 per hour in 2009; and $21 to $24 per hour in 2010\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "187  The plaintiff testified that her income from the Securicor job alone was about $4,000 per month in 2006, an amount more than her combined incomes in 2004 and 2005 as a result of her increasing hourly rate at Securicor and increased overtime hours. Ms. Langille's income tax returns show: 2006 gross employment income of $46,166, or an average of $3,847 per month; 2007 gross employment income of $50,090, or an average of $4,174 per month; 2008 gross employment income of $58,871, or an average of $4,905 per month; and 2009 gross employment income of $61,113, or an average of $5,092 per month\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "189  The other issue regarding the job at the pub was Ms. Langille's acknowledgement that there would have been scheduling conflicts as between her job at Securicor and her job at the pub. The plaintiff gave evidence about her various shifts at Securicor at various times, confirming that her schedule was varied, subject to change, and included afternoon and graveyard shifts which would have conflicted with her pub job\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "190  I find that Ms. Langille made a considered decision to quit her job at the pub as a result of her quite reasonable decision to focus her attention on her job at Securicor, and not as a result of the first accident. She has failed to establish any loss arising from her decision to forego her job at the pub\n",

      "192  After Ms. Langille's return to work after the first accident, she continued working full time for the four and a half years before the second accident. When she returned in February 2005, she signed up to work overtime. She testified that she was working \"a lot of overtime\" in 2006. The payroll records confirm that she was working between 10 and 20 hours of overtime most months during 2005 and 2006, basically the same amount of overtime that she worked in 2004\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "193  Ms. Langille worked full time at Securicor from February 2005 until December 2009. The evidence also discloses that she occasionally worked overtime before the second accident, and she continued to occasionally work overtime after her return to work in June 2010\n",

      "\n",
      "194  The payroll records indicate that her overtime hours varied from as low as 15 hours per month to a high of 48 hours per month in the year before the second accident in December 2009. However, she worked overtime every month after she returned to work, from a low of five hours up to a high of 31 hours in November 2010\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "195  Ms. Langille asserts that she would have been working on average 20 hours per month in overtime with Securicor but for the accidents. Initially, after the first accident, she was offered or signed up for overtime and tried to do it. But she found it difficult and painful when she tried, or she had to refuse it altogether. Given her work ethic and her enjoyment of her job at Securicor, I accept that she would have worked this amount of overtime. I also accept her submissions and find that her injuries arising from the accidents prevented her occasionally from working to this level. She testified that she was often tired and unable to continue or unable to come in for extra shifts because of her injuries. I also accept that there was abundant overtime at Securicor for her to have the opportunity to take such work\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "196  However, Ms. Langille did not produce any payroll records after January 2011 to support the actual amount of overtime she did work. No explanation was advanced for the failure to provide documentation to support the contention that she was not working as much overtime as her stated average of 20 hours per month\n",
      "======\n",

      "197  The only evidence as to the proper calculation comes from Mr. Benning's report. He was also not provided any income information for 2012 (despite his report being prepared in September 2012). He therefore simply assumed the same figures from 2011 for that year. He has taken the 2009 income at Securicor at $60,465 and adjusted the figures for 2010-2012. He then deducted this figure from her actual income. For 2010, that gives rise to the income loss figure which I already accepted above - $30,017. For 2011 and 2012, the income loss is said to be $6,518 per year. Applying appropriate deductions for EI and income tax, that provides a net figure of $4,522 per year\n",

      "\n",
      "198  Mr. Benning's calculations provide a somewhat accurate comparison for the years 2010-2012, but they do so on the basis of the T4 income as between those years. They do not provide any breakdown as between Ms. Langille's regular income, about which there is no issue, and the overtime that she worked for the purpose of comparing the former figure to what she could have worked. Mr. Benning's figures therefore do not illuminate the issue as regards Ms. Langille's overtime income for 2011-2012\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "199  Given the state of this evidence, I am unable to conclude that Ms. Langille has proved any income loss arising from any inability to work overtime after returning to work for Securicor.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "200  A claim for loss of future earning capacity raises two key questions: 1) has the plaintiff's earning capacity been impaired by his or her injuries; and 2) if so, what compensation should be awarded for the resulting financial harm that will accrue over time?

      "[101] The relevant principles may be briefly summarized. The standard of proof in relation to future events is simple probability, not the balance of probabilities, and hypothetical events are to be given weight according to their relative likelihood: Athey v. Leonati,  at para. 27. A plaintiff is entitled to compensation for real and substantial possibilities of loss, which are to be quantified by estimating the chance of the loss occurring: Athey v. Leonati, supra, at para. 27, Steenblok v. Funk  at 135 (C.A.). The valuation of the loss of earning capacity may involve a comparison of what the plaintiff would probably have earned but for the accident with what he will probably earn in his injured condition: Milina v. Bartsch  at 93 (S.C.). However, that is not the end of the inquiry; the overall fairness and reasonableness of the award must be considered: Rosvold v. Dunlop ,  at para. 11; Ryder v. Paquette,  (C.A.) (Q.L.). Moreover, the task of the Court is to assess the losses, not to calculate them mathematically: Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate  (C.A.). Finally, since the course of future events is unknown, allowance must be made for the contingency that the assumptions upon which the award is based may prove to be wrong: Milina v. Bartsch, supra, at 79. ..\n",

      "[42] The approach to such claims is well set out in the decision of Garson J.A. in Perren v. Lalari,  at paras. 25-32, which I summarize as follows:\n",
      "A plaintiff must first prove there is a real and substantial possibility of a future event leading to an income loss before the Court will embark on an assessment of the loss;\n",
      "A future or hypothetical possibility will be taken into consideration as long as it is a real and substantial possibility and not mere speculation;\n",
      "A plaintiff may be able to prove that there is a substantial possibility of a future income loss despite having returned to his or her employment;\n",
      "An inability to perform an occupation that is not a realistic alternative occupation is not proof of a future loss;\n",
      "It is not the loss of earnings but rather the loss of earning capacity for which compensation must be made;\n",
      "If the plaintiff discharges the burden of proof, then there must be quantification of that loss;\n",
      "Two available methods of quantifying the loss are (a) an earnings approach or (b) a capital asset approach;\n",
      "An earnings approach will be more useful when the loss is more easily measurable;\n",
      "The capital asset approach will be more useful when the loss is not easily measurable\n",

      "207  Ms. Langille concedes that a plaintiff's past earnings are a significant factor that must, at law, be considered in assessing a loss of income earning capacity and will be a starting point in the assessment of the loss: Vaillancourt v. Molnar Estate, . She says that she has a long history of working more than full-time hours, and that it is unreasonable to deny any claim on the basis that she is making more money now. In addition, although she concedes that her job is secure, she says that this fact does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that she will have no loss\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "208  She says that but for the accidents, the plaintiff would have succeeded in her employment and would be in position to take advantage of the abundant overtime available to her. One way or another, the pattern of working a job and a half would have continued. This was her pre-accident habit, and the law is that pre-accident employment is assumed to continue but for the collisions. She says that she is presently working about 40 hours a week, whereas before the accidents she was working closer to 60 hours a week\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "209  She also says that the other aspect of the loss arises from the possibility of her losing her present job. Ms. Langille did not graduate from high school. She used to do stucco/construction, but her injuries would prevent her from doing that type of physical job given her partial disability. Further, she can no longer work in pubs or beer and wine stores. Ultimately, she can no longer do overhead work, all of which she did previously\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "210  I turn firstly to consider whether Ms. Langille has established a real and substantial possibility of an income loss. Ms. Langille relies on Garcha v. Duenas,  as an example of a similar situation. In that case, a machinist was permanently partially disabled, as I have found Ms. Langille to be. He was able to return to work full time, but only as a result of his employer's accommodation of his physical restrictions: para. 75. Madam Justice Boyd found:\n",
      "[82] Thus I find that the plaintiff faces the real possibility of a future income loss on several fronts: If Mr. Ranu or some other charge hand at Avcorp is no longer able to accommodate his physical restrictions and requires that he perform a full range of machinist's duties, he may well lose this employment. Even if he does not lose this employment, if there are periods when there will be opportunities for significant overtime work, it is unlikely he will be able to work those longer hours. If he loses his employment at Avcorp, or if there are layoffs at Avcorp and he looks for alternative or supplementary work pending a resumption of work at Avcorp, then I expect he will very likely have difficulty finding alternative employment or supplementary employment as a machinist. Relying on both the plaintiff's and Mr. Ranu's evidence, I find that the machinist work at Avcorp is very much on the \"lighter' end of the scale and that machinist work in other plants often involves much heavier work. Based on the evidence of Dr. Parhar and Mr. Shew I find that the plaintiff would not be able to perform that heavy work.\n",
      "[83] Finally I expect that in the event the plaintiff retires at age 65, he will likely not be able to pursue the many machinist jobs he would have likely searched for and obtained, even in his older years. I say this since, in my view, the plaintiff has, both in the past and on an ongoing basis, demonstrated a very strong work ethic and a desire to optimize his earnings at every opportunity.\n",
      "[84] I find that the plaintiff has proven there is a significant possibility of any of these future events occurring, which would all obviously result in a pecuniary loss. This is not the case of a white collar worker complaining he is unable to return to the heavy labour job he performed in his youth. This is the case of a senior journeyman machinist who has been rendered unable to perform the full scope of the work in his lifelong career of choice.\n",
      "...\n",
      "[93] On a review of all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has proven a real and substantial possibility of the many different future events outlined earlier, all of which would lead to an income loss. I am satisfied these events are not limited to a few occasions when the plaintiff will have flare-ups of symptoms. Rather I find that he is permanently partially disabled and now effectively excluded from performing heavy machinist work and any substantial amount of overtime work. This will substantially reduce his overall employability, make him less marketable and less competitive as an employee, and finally, less valuable overall\n",

Highly strenuous activities at work such as heavy lifting, squatting and kneeling will likely aggravate her pain. ...

      "Ms. Langille is presently working for G4S in an armored vehicle. She works on a shift that involves little squatting, kneeling or heavy lifting. In my opinion, she should continue with these shifts in order to minimize the risk of flare-up of the pain in her neck, back, left shoulder, hips and knees. However, in the future, if she had to change careers, she would be limited to sedentary or light jobs that involve little squatting, kneeling, heavy lifting, sudden movements of her trunk and torso. Overhead work would also aggravate her left shoulder. Any more strenuous activities will likely aggravate her pain throughout all of these joints. These limitations will likely be on a permanent basis\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "215  Ms. Langille also presented the functional capacity report prepared by Marco Aquila of Core Medical Centre dated January 16, 2013. Mr. Aquila was asked to opine on Ms. Langille's functional limitations and her ability to return to work as an armored car guard/custodian. Essentially, he found that Ms. Langille was able to fulfill all of her required job functions:\n",
      "1. What are Ms. Langille's functional limitations?\n",
      "Ms. Langille did not demonstrate the ability to safely lift, and perform above-shoulder work.\n",
      "Lifting: Ms. Langille's performance on the maximum isoinertial lifting evaluation did not demonstrate the ability to safely lift 50 lbs on an occasional basis.\n",
      "Above-shoulder work: Ms. Langille's performance on upward reaching repetitive movement test, and the overhead to knee transfer test demonstrated her intolerance to above-shoulder work. She reported immediate pain symptoms in the right arm and shoulder with this activity.\n",
      "Ms. Langille also reported limitations in her ability to perform low-level work and crouching. Dr. F. Tarazi (Orthopaedic Surgeon) stated that she continued to complain of significant pain which was aggravated by squatting, kneeling, heavy lifting, sudden twisting movements and impact activities. Her low back pain had been ongoing for the past eight years and therefore was most likely chronic and would likely continue on an ongoing basis. It would continue to cause her functional limitations in the future (Dr. Tarazi, 2012).\n",
      "2. Is Ms. Langille able to return to work as an Armored Car Guard (Custodian)? If she cannot, what parts of the position is she unable to do--\n",
      "Ms. Langille's target job was identified as having a physical demand level of Medium. The Physical Demand Characteristics of Work chart (Matheson 1983) describes Medium as consisting of lifting 20 to 50 pounds for up to one-third of the hours worked daily. Ms. Langille did not demonstrate the ability to meet this Medium physical demand characteristic of work. Furthermore, Ms. Langille did not demonstrate the ability to perform above-shoulder level work without an increase in reported pain symptoms in the right arm/shoulder.\n",
      "It is this evaluator's opinion that Ms. Langille may be able to return to work as an armored-car guard/custodian with job duty modifications. Modifications should include accommodations for activities that involve the use of her right arm/shoulder, neck, and lower back. More specifically, job duties which involve lifting, above-shoulder work, and squatting/crouching should be limited. Lastly, restrictions regarding her reported inability to perform twisting/spinal rotation and low-level work should also be taken into consideration\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "216  The defence challenges this claim. It says that the evidence establishes that Ms. Langille is in a job that she enjoys. She has received good reviews from her employer and there are no concerns about her job performance. She has every intention of remaining employed with Securicor\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "217  I agree that the evidence establishes that Ms. Langille is fairly secure in her current position and that barring unforeseen circumstances, she should remain so. In addition, while the defence points to the current chiropractic treatment as assisting Ms. Langille's condition and states that her condition is \"improving\", the overwhelming medical evidence is that Ms. Langille's pain is continuing and that it is a permanent disability that she will live with for the rest of her life. That Ms. Langille has for the most part been able to cope with her employment duties is, in my view, in large part due to her stoicism in the face of ongoing pain, the imperative of not jeopardizing her prospects of remaining in what she calls a good and good-paying job, and most importantly, the accommodation that she currently enjoys from her co-worker\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "218  The focus of this enquiry is not whether Ms. Langille is able to continue in her job. The real question is whether her capacity to work has been impaired: Pallos at para. 41. In Pallos, the plaintiff was disabled from his previous duties, although he continued to be employed at the same income. Conversely, in Perrin, the claim was disallowed because there was no evidence that the plaintiff was limited in performing any realistic alternative occupation: para. 33\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "219  The evidence here clearly indicates that Ms. Langille is either coping with pain or limited in what she can perform at Securicor. At present, she is coping with some accommodation from her co-worker, Mr. Stewart. That might or might not be the case in the future depending on who is working with her. In addition, Ms. Langille testified to other types of jobs within Securicor that would be more physically strenuous and that these would present further challenges to her. Her evidence is, in effect, that she is not able to take advantage of the overtime that she would usually work, although there is no documentation to support that contention\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "220  Finally, the authorities indicate that when considering capacity, the court must consider the possibility that the plaintiff will not continue in that position. If Ms. Langille should lose her position, the medical and functional capacity evidence, as above, clearly indicates that certain occupations will be foreclosed to her. She has limited education, and in the past, before obtaining her position with Securicor, her typical occupations involved some physicality. Stucco work and bartending are all inappropriate occupations for her. It is these types of jobs which Ms. Langille would typically have to find in the event that her employment ceased\n",

      "\n",
      "221  I find that Ms. Langille has proved that her injuries have resulted in a real and substantial possibility of a future income loss. I turn to the matter of the amount of an award\n",

      "222  Ms. Langille asserts that there is a loss of a capital asset and seeks an award of $175,000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "223  Given that Ms. Langille is continuing in her job at Securicor, I consider that the capital approach makes more sense than taking an income approach. Nevertheless, I am in the dark as to how Ms. Langille arrives at this figure, save that it appears to be the same figure as was awarded in Garcha at para. 95, also on a capital asset approach. In Garcha, however, the court considered the potential income loss of overtime, which was a major basis for the contention that there would be an income loss: paras. 88-89. While the court ultimately assessed the loss rather than apply a mathematical calculation (as required in accordance with the authorities), it appears that the court was guided somewhat in coming to an award by the overtime loss figures\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "224  It is well taken that an award is an \"assessment\". However, an award must still be based on the evidence. The courts have consistently used mathematical calculations as \"guideposts\" to provide some parameters towards arriving at that assessed figure: Morris v. Rose Estate  (C.A.) at paras. 20-24\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "225  Recently, the Court of Appeal in Morgan v. Galbraith,  emphasized the necessity under the capital asset approach of considering the Brown factors and making appropriate findings of fact as to the nature and extent of the loss of capacity:\n",
      "[54] The economic evidence relied on by Mr. Morgan quantified lifetime earnings of a sport coach in Oregon at $883,004. The judge did not explain the basis of his $700,000 assessment. This amount approximates 80% of lifetime earnings of a coach, notwithstanding that Mr. Morgan is now employed as a coach. I do not mean to imply that the assessment must be a mathematical calculation. Rather, my point is that there must be findings of fact on which to base the assessment. Here, the reasons for judgment on this point are not sufficient to permit appellate review. The judge gave no hint as to the factual basis on which he reached the conclusion that on these facts $700,000 was an appropriate measure of Mr. Morgan's future damages. The judge did compare this case to another similar case, but, in my view, that would not be an appropriate way to assess what is essentially a pecuniary damage award. I do not consider that it is appropriate for this Court to infer from the judge's reasons the necessary findings of fact in order to substitute a different award or to affirm the correctness of the award.\n",
      "[55] The judge could well have chosen the earnings approach given that Mr. Morgan was likely to pursue a career in sport regardless of the accident and that doing so after the accident was possible but with limitations. The judge made no findings concerning the extent of those limitations. As I have concluded that the appropriate disposition of this appeal is to remit the question of the assessment of damages for future loss of earning capacity to the judge, I will leave to the trial judge the question of the appropriate approach to adopt. To reiterate, I agree with Mr. Morgan that on a proper evidentiary basis the judge has already found that there is a loss of future earning capacity under the Perren test. He need not reconsider that finding. But it will be necessary for him to revisit the assessment on a proper factual underpinning.\n",
      "[56] If the assessment is still to be based on the capital asset approach the judge must consider the four questions in Brown in the context of the facts of this case and make findings of fact as to the nature and extent of the plaintiff's loss of capacity and how that loss may impact the plaintiff's ability to earn income. Adopting the capital asset approach does not mean that the assessment is entirely at large without the necessity to explain the factual basis of the award: Morris v. Rose Estate  at para. 24, ; Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate  at para. 43, .\n",

As I have stated, this calculation has its limitations in terms of separating out the overtime issue. Again, in terms of the overtime issue, one would have expected to see records to indicate the actual amount of overtime she worked in the last two years, as opposed to what she said she would have done. The reason for this omission may, in fact, be that she has been working on average 20 extra hours of overtime every month. I note that for October and November, 2010 and January, 2011, the overtime hours were approximately 18, 32, and 17, respectively\n",

That calculation yields a total loss of $42,000\n",

This amount is based on my assessment of loss of some minimal overtime at Securicor over Ms. Langille's remaining working life there. It also accounts for the risk of loss arising from any other jobs at Securicor and also the risk that Ms. Langille may have to find a lower paying job if she should leave Securicor. I have also accounted for positive and negative contingencies in respect of this figure, including that Ms. Langille may in the future be able to complete as much or most of the overtime she wanted, that she may remain in her current position with Securicor for her remaining working life, and that she may secure a job elsewhere with the same income: Tsalamandris v. McLeod,  at paras. 50-53. Finally, this amount considers the impact of the second accident and Ms. Langille's share of responsibility for that accident, as I have found above.\n",

After her release from hospital, Mr. Dooris took her to Campbell River to his home. At that time, he did everything for her -- including bathing, cleaning, cooking, and generally making her comfortable. Ms. Langille went back to her home after Christmas 2009. Upon her return in January 2010, Ms. Langille obtained some professional assistance after the second accident. The cost of this care was claimed as a special expense and has been allowed in this action\n",

      "250  The defence cites Frankson v. Myre, , which summarizes the principles in relation to such claims, following more recent B.C. Court of Appeal authority. In this case, the \"in trust\" claim arose from care provided by the plaintiff's mother, Mrs. Frankson, to the plaintiff during the period following the accident. Mr. Justice Savage stated:\n",
      "[50] The law of \"in trust\" claims is governed by the principles set out by the British Columbia Supreme Court in Bystedt (Guardian ad litem of) v. Bagdan  at para. 180, aff'd .\n",
      "[51] The six relevant factors are:\n",
      "the services provided must replace services necessary for the care of the plaintiff as a result of a plaintiff's injuries;\n",
      "if the services are rendered by a family member, they must be over and above what would be expected from the family relationship;\n",
      "the maximum value of such services is the cost of obtaining the services outside the family;\n",
      "where the opportunity cost to the care-giving family member is lower than the cost of obtaining the services independently, the court will award the lower amount;\n",
      "quantification should reflect the true and reasonable value of the services performed taking into account the time, quality and nature of those services;\n",
      "the family members providing the services need not forego other income and there need not be payment for the services rendered.\n",
      "[52] An example of the application of the factors in Bystedt occurs in Dufault v. Kathed Holdings Ltd., . In Dufault, the services provided by the plaintiff involved toileting, bathing, transfer from wheelchair to shower and toilet, laundry, cooking, feeding, and taking the plaintiff to visit health care providers.\n",
      "[53] In his analysis, Cohen J. sets out the factors. He reviews the various \"in-trust\" decisions at paragraphs 175 and 176, and concludes that the services provided to the plaintiff did not go above and beyond what would be expected to be performed out of a sense of love, friendship or family duty. In the result, the \"in trust\" claim in Dufault was dismissed\n",

      "251  In Frankson, the court did not find that the services provided by the plaintiff's mother went beyond what might be performed out of a sense of love, friendship or family duty: paras. 55-56\n",

      "\n",
      "252  The defence submits that the care provided by Mr. Dooris and Ms. Viani was exactly the type of care considered by the court in Frankson and Dufault. It was care performed out of a sense of love, friendship, or family duty. While I acknowledge that they would have cared to some extent for Ms. Langille, I disagree that their level of care was within the normal bounds of \"love, friendship or family duty\"\n",
      "======\n",

      "253  Ms. Viani no doubt had her own life, but she took specific pains to come over every night after work for an entire month. Her level of care for Ms. Langille goes well beyond what friends, even best friends, might expect.

The plaintiff braked sharply and stopped, hitting the tree, but remaining straight in his lane. Mariash also braked sharply. He did not have anti- lock brakes. As he slowed, his low-bed trailer jackknifed to the left, then straightened, and jackknifed to the right. He hit the tree, and the jackknifed trailer struck the back of the plaintiff's vehicle.

He reduced his speed to about 90 - 95 kph when the downpour started. He was travelling 8 - 10 car lengths behind the plaintiff's Bronco. When he saw the tree begin to fall, he put on his engine brake and downshifted, breaking and beginning to slide a little on the wet pavement. His tires were brand new Michelins.\n",

The law does not demand a standard of perfection for a driver faced with a sudden emergency (Gill Estate v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., ). In addition, even in cases where the defendant's vehicle is in the oncoming lane (which is not the case here), that is not proof of negligence if there is an explanation that is equally consistent with negligence and no negligence (Pitt Enterprises Ltd. v. Farkes, )\n",

      "11  The plaintiff relies on Redlack v. Vekved , a case in which the defendant hit a patch of black ice on a cold morning. The Court of Appeal said:\n",
      "A prudent driver in such circumstances must always bear in mind the possibility of icy patches and drive within his or her own competence, and the capacity of her vehicle, to cope with such patches. ... To drive in such circumstances as if it were summer is not the conduct of prudent driver\n",

      "\n",
      "16  The accident was not the result of an obstruction such as branches or debris that one might expect in a wind storm and that would be there to be seen if one were travelling at a reasonable speed. This accident occurred because a tree fell suddenly in front of both vehicles, blocking both lanes. Both vehicles hit the tree\n",

      "17  This is not similar to a situation where a driver is travelling in the winter and is expected to cope with unexpected icy patches (according to the Court of Appeal in Redlack v. Vekved, supra, but perhaps not in Hearn v. Rowland, supra). There is no evidence from which an inference could be drawn that the defendant in this case was driving beyond his own competence or that of his vehicle. He was travelling below the speed limit. He was faced with an unexpected event that could not be anticipated and he reacted reasonably.

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "20  The plaintiff, in responding to the Code 3 call, knew the pedestrian bridge had collapsed over the highway and it was \"unknown for injuries\". Code 3 calls mandate a priority one response and police officers are expected to activate their emergency equipment, including lights and sirens, and to attend the scene at a safe and reasonable speed. Although there were emergency vehicles with activated emergency lights and sirens present in the vicinity of the collapsed overpass, the Code 3 had not been cancelled prior to the collision\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "21  It is a critical and uncontroverted fact that the plaintiff, in responding to the Code 3 call, immediately and continually employed his automatic flashing emergency lights and sirens and repeatedly sounded his air horn, which he described as a \"loud, irritating blast of noise\". He accelerated towards the overpass accident scene at a speed he determined was safe and reasonable. He initially \"split the traffic\" and travelled between the two northbound lanes before eventually coming to a police roadblock at the Chilko Dr. intersection which was preventing civilian vehicles from proceeding north. After passing around the raised median at Chilko Dr., he began travelling in the southbound lane in a northerly direction towards the overpass. However, while driving, he observed some traffic moving in the opposite direction from him in those southbound lanes; some vehicles in the northbound lanes closer to the collapsed overpass were executing U-turns into the southbound lanes. He also assumed that some vehicles were still passing underneath the intact portion of the overpass. He determined that travelling on the flat median area would be the most prudent and most efficient path of travel in the circumstances. He proceeded cautiously, with his lights and sirens activated, repeatedly blowing his air horn so that the drivers on the highway could hear him and see him. He reduced his speed after passing the roadblock\n",

      "22  The defendant, who was driving a large pick-up truck, suddenly and without warning pulled out of the northbound lane and turned directly into the path in front of him. The plaintiff instantly determined that he would be unable to swerve to avoid the vehicle, and realizing a collision was inevitable, he took, in the circumstances, what he deemed to be the most reasonable course of action. Prior to impact, he laid down his motorcycle on its left side and tried to dismount the motorcycle so that his body would not directly impact the truck. He made a conscious effort to tuck himself into a ball by bringing in his legs and arms before landing on the pavement. He was able to execute this manoeuvre, at least in part, because of his training as a member of the emergency response team in the Armed Forces. His motorcycle collided with the driver's side of the truck\n",

Through her rear-view mirror she observed the plaintiff's motorcycle travelling down the median with its lights flashing. She noticed his motorcycle just after it passed the Chilko Dr. intersection. She estimated that the plaintiff was travelling at a speed of 50-60 kilometres per hour. She then observed that the truck behind her had begun to veer to the left; it had turned approximately 45 degrees west when she heard the loud slam of the collision. She immediately turned to look over her shoulder and saw the motorcycle driver fly through the air and then hit the ground. Ms. O. conveyed to the Court her shock at the time that any driver would attempt to complete a U-turn while an emergency motorcycle was approaching\n",

      "27  Mr. K. was travelling in a convertible with its top down directly behind the defendants' truck. He noticed other cars were backed up in front of him and waiting in line, but he was unable to identify the emergency or what was causing the stalled, \"stop and go\" traffic. Mr. K. had just started to contemplate executing a U-turn when he heard the plaintiff's motorcycle siren approaching from behind him. He estimated that he first observed the plaintiff's motorcycle about 20 seconds prior to the collision. He turned his head around and had a clear view of a police officer on a motorcycle with flashing lights travelling up the median. He estimated its speed as 50-60 kilometres per hour. He concluded it was best to remain in his current position\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  Mr. K. then observed that the defendants' pick-up truck, which was stopped one-half to one car length immediately in front of him, was beginning to pull out to the left. He observed that the driver turned without turning his head to check for traffic and without turning on his signal lights. Mr. K. stated that he thought to himself \"what the heck is he [the driver of the truck] doing?\" when he first noticed the truck's movement to the left. According to Mr. K., the police motorcycle was approximately two or three car lengths behind the defendants' truck when the defendant began his U-turn\n",

      "29  Mr. K. saw the motorcycle driver \"dump\" the motorcycle, the motorcycle collide with the truck and the motorcycle driver ricochet off the truck and fly through the air \"like a rag doll\".

Within what he estimated to be five seconds of completing his U-turn, he heard the motorcycle sirens and observed the plaintiff's motorcycle travelling down the median with its lights activated. He described the motorcycle as travelling \"pretty fast\". He then saw the defendant, who was a \"quarter way\" through his U-turn, collide with the motorcycle.\n",

However, I note that these witnesses were attempting to give detailed descriptions of a sequence of events which happened suddenly, over the course of seconds or split-seconds. It is not surprising that their recollections were not identical\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "32  The evidence establishes that both Ms. O. and Mr. K., in the vehicles directly in front of and behind the defendant, saw the plaintiff prior to the collision travelling down the centre of the median with his emergency lights activated. Mr. K. heard the plaintiff's motorcycle siren; Ms. O. heard the sirens of emergency vehicles behind her. They both remained in their respective positions as they were required to do pursuant to s. 177 of the MVA. With respect to their observations of the defendant and the sequence of events immediately preceding the collision, I found the evidence of both Ms. O. and Mr. K. credible and reliable\n",

      "33  While Mr. KR. testified that he did not hear the siren or see the motorcycle until just after he had completed his U-turn, he was at least 50 feet ahead of the defendant. Moreover, the evidence does not support a finding that Mr. KR. checked his mirrors prior to executing his U-turn. Although he testified that he had been directed by a police officer to execute a U-turn, the totality of the evidence does not support such a finding. Neither the plaintiff, the defendant, Ms. O., nor Mr. K. saw a police officer directing U-turns.\n",

Both he and the defendant testified that his vehicle was immediately behind the defendants' truck. This is inconsistent with the evidence of Mr. K., who testified that it was his vehicle that was directly behind the defendants' truck. I prefer the evidence of Mr. K. on this point, as I find it more consistent with the reasonable probabilities of the situation.\n",

      "35  The defendant was proceeding in a northerly direction on the Lougheed Highway in his canopied 3/4 ton pick-up truck. The driver's side window of his truck was open. Prior to the collision, he had been stopped in bumper-to-bumper traffic, during which time he saw lights from emergency vehicles and heard the ambient sound of sirens. He also observed that there were cars left abandoned along the shoulder and an out-of-province motorcycle travelling on the right-hand shoulder. The defendant made his U-turn without being directed to by any emergency personnel. Although the defendant did hear a loud grinding or screeching noise a few seconds before the impact, he only saw the motorcycle when it slid by his window and hit his truck. He slammed on his brakes in the split seconds prior to the collision. After the collision, he immediately put his truck in park and jumped out of the vehicle. The defendant was not injured in the collision\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  The defendant's evidence on material points contradicted both his own testimony at trial and the evidence of the independent witnesses without any satisfactory explanation. The following examples are illustrative:\n",
      "He stated he was travelling in the lane closest to the median, and maintained that it was \"his turn\" to make a U-turn. He recalls that although there were a few staggered vehicles ahead of him there were no drivers in those vehicles. However, the evidence clearly establishes that Ms. O.'s vehicle was directly in front of him in the lane.\n",
      "He testified at his examination for discovery that his truck remained in the northbound lane closest to the median, and maintained that he had not turned into the median prior to impact. At trial, he testified that at the time of the collision, he was \"on or right around the centre median line\" and that his tire was \"very close to the median\". He conceded in cross-examination that the front of his vehicle may have been in the median. The three collision experts and the independent witnesses all place his truck well through the median at the time of impact.\n",
      "He testified that he checked his mirror seconds before he started executing his U-turn. He stated that he could see back to the Chilko Dr. intersection and he saw a \"clear road on the other side and traffic backed up\" behind him. Given the other evidence which I prefer, the only rational conclusion is that the defendant did not check his mirrors before making his U-turn or execute a proper shoulder check (which would have finished with a turn to the blind spot on his left); had he done so, he would have seen the plaintiff approaching. Both the defendant's own expert, Mr. I., as well as Mr. SE., the plaintiff's expert, were of the opinion that if he had checked his mirrors, the plaintiff would have been in his view.\n",
      "He testified that prior to executing his U-turn, he turned on his turn signal. This evidence was directly contradicted by Mr. K\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  An assessment of the defendant's evidence as a whole demonstrates that it is not reliable. I consider it unsafe to give any weight to his evidence that tends to implicate the plaintiff for being at fault for the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  The preponderance of the evidence shows that the left front tire of the defendants' truck was well between the two yellow median line markers at the time of impact. The defendant had clearly initiated his U-turn prior to the collision. He violated s. 163 of the MVA by making a U-turn on a divided highway and in breaching the law, he was under a heightened duty of care: Bradley v. Bath,  at para. 27. Contrary to the submissions of his counsel, the defendant did not exercise caution in executing his U-turn. The defendant admits that he was not directed to do the U-turn by any emergency personnel. Moreover, it was \"not his turn\" to make a U-turn; Ms. O.'s vehicle was in front of him. Even if he could not locate the source of the sirens, given the presence of emergency vehicles, the defendant should have looked carefully before executing any turn. If he had done so, he would have seen the plaintiff -- the plaintiff was there to be seen and heard by the defendant\n",

Harris, ; Dickie Estate v. Dickie and Desousa  (C.A.). The location and nature of his unlawful manoeuvre in an area where he knew there were emergency vehicles required him to pay particular attention. Had he looked in his mirrors and conducted a proper shoulder check, he would not have initiated his turn in such patently unsafe circumstances.\n",

D., the National Coordinator for Collision Investigation Training at the RCMP Pacific Region Training Centre. Sergeant D., who is not an engineer, gave opinion evidence as a traffic collision analyst. He opined that the speed of the motorcycle was a minimum of 33 kilometres per hour. His analysis is incomplete because it calculates the speed of the motorcycle using only the skid marks; therefore, it is of limited assistance\n",

      "\n",
      "43  The evidence as to the resting position of the two vehicles and the damage sustained by each of the vehicles was uncontroversial.

Sergeant D. was of the view that the impact moved the truck on its rotational axis approximately one metre\n",

      "45  The RCMP Traffic Collision Reconstruction Report describes the damage to the motorcycle. The primary damage to the motorcycle, which slid to rest on its left side, consisted of \"abrasion to the left outboard side of the engine guard, the left saddlebag guard and the lid to the left saddlebag.\" The report also states as follows:\n",
      "Secondary contact damage consisted of a shattering of the underside of the right side mounted saddlebag. The right side saddlebag guard rails were bent upward. The right rear, arm mounted signal lamp was broken and bent upward.\n",
      "There was denting to the underside of the right side mounted exhaust muffler, which was pushed upward and inward toward the right side of the rear tire. ... The right side lower tubular frame rail, under the engine, was flattened and bent upward.\n",

      "46  Mr. I. opines that the plaintiff's motorcycle lost speed as a result of the braking, the impact with the defendants' truck, and the eventual sliding to a rest position. He considered the skid marks on the roadway identified by the investigating officers and the final resting position of the plaintiff's motorcycle. He analyzed each of these factors to provide an opinion as to the motorcycle's initial speed prior to the application of the brakes. In essence, he analyzed the initial speed of the motorcycle by working backwards from its resting position\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "47  In his analysis, he observes that only one skid mark was visible at the incident scene, likely from the motorcycle's rear tire. The police measured a 17.3 metre tire mark prior to impact\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  From his review of the police photographs and scale diagram, Mr. I. opines that the motorcycle slid approximately five metres from impact to rest. Mr. I., in applying the published works of Lambourn (1991), quantified the co-efficient of sliding friction of a motorcycle sliding on its side on asphalt to be in the range of 0.25 to 0.53. In his opinion, the motorcycle exited from the side of the truck at approximately 18 to 26 kilometres per hour. Through the application of a computer accident simulation and reconstruction program, he concluded that this required an impact speed of 37 to 54 kilometres per hour. He notes that because he used a conservative coefficient of restitution for the collision, the motorcycle's speed was \"possibly higher\". He also notes that both brakes could have been applied, with only the rear applied hard enough to lock the wheel; this is significant because the friction coefficient used in the crash analysis varies with whether there was rear braking only or whether there was front and rear braking\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "49  Considering the 17.3 metre tire mark prior to impact and a speed of 37 to 54 kilometres per hour at the end of the skid, he opines that the initial speed of the plaintiff's motorcycle was between 52 and 86 kilometres per hour. If only rear braking was applied, he opines that the motorcycle's initial speed was between 52 and 72 kilometres per hour\n",
      "======\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "51  Mr. SE.'s analysis of the range of the post-impact speed of the motorcycle and therefore its initial speed differed from that of Mr. I. He described two factors which resulted in Mr. I.'s overestimated calculations -- the coefficient of friction on the roadway and not taking into account that the motorcycle had slid on its side prior to the collision\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "52  In his opinion, Mr. I.'s use of 0.25 to 0.53 for the coefficient of friction resulted in an overestimation of the post-impact speed of the motorcycle. Mr. SE. noted that the Lambourn test involved motorcycles varying in size, from a Honda 90 to a Honda CB 750G. In his report, Mr. SE. states as follows:\n",
      "The ... Harley Davidson was fitted with crash bars at the front and had metal guards around the saddlebags. Only one motorcycle in the Lambourn test was fitted with crash bars; the Honda CB 750G had crash bars over the crank case ends. The range for the coefficient of sliding friction for this motorcycle was 0.25 to 0.35.\n",
      "Applying this coefficient of friction, Mr. SE. calculated a range of 18 to 21 kilometres per hour for the post-impact speed of the plaintiff's motorcycle\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "53  Mr. SE. also observed that Mr. I. stated that only one skid mark was visible at the accident site, and that the length of the mark was 17.3 metres. However, he points out that Sgt. D. in his traffic collision reconstruction report describes a metal scar on the road surface seen in the police photograph. According to Mr. SE., this is a significant component in the analysis; the scar was most likely from the crash bar on the left side of the motorcycle, and indicates that it was sliding on its left side as it approached the truck. Therefore, he opines that the 17.3 metres used by Mr. I. as the skid distance was too long and ultimately inaccurate. Mr. SE. also states that based on the measurements he took from the scene, the length of the mark made by the crash bar before it changed direction abruptly was about 3.6 metres. Therefore his calculations were based on the motorcycle sliding on its side for 3.6 metres and braking for 13.7 metres\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "54  Based on the above, Mr. SE. calculates that, if the front and rear brakes were applied, the pre-braking or initial speed of the motorcycle was between 51 and 76 kilometres per hour. Had only the rear brakes been applied, the pre-braking speed would have been between 51 and 63 kilometres per hour\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "55  In Mr. SE.'s opinion, at the time of impact, the front wheel of the defendants' truck was approximately 20 inches from the western side of the median\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "56  Finally, he states that:\n",
      "Therefore, if Mr. [Y.] had scanned his mirrors while trying to localize the source of the approaching siren, he would have had an unobstructed view of the motorcycle for at least the final 98 metres of its travel. ...\n",

      "\n",
      "57  Mr. I. conceded that Mr. SE. had offered some valid criticisms of his report. He acknowledged that Mr. SE.'s analysis was correct and that the crash bars would lower the coefficient of friction. While he did not concede that the range was as low as that asserted by Mr. SE., he did acknowledge in cross-examination that he would \"split the difference\" in the range of the coefficient of friction. This calculation in turn impacts the calculation of the initial speed of the motorcycle. He also conceded that Mr. SE. had a valid point that the coefficient of friction should be reduced because there was a concurrent scrape parallel to the skid mark which he had not factored into his calculations. He admitted in cross-examination that this was a \"very difficult problem\" that had not been fully explored in his report\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "60  In my view, on cross-examination, Mr. SE.'s opinion was not shown to be faulty in any substantive way. Mr. SE. acknowledged in cross-examination the possibility that both his and Mr. I.'s calculations on speed may be conservative because neither analysis factored in the extent to which the truck was moved by the impact. However, Mr. SE. testified and I accept that the increase in the speed estimates would be marginal\n",
      "======\n",

      "\n",
      "62  The crucial question is whether the plaintiff failed to take reasonable care for his own safety and the safety of the public, and if so, whether his failure to do so was one of the causes of the collision. For the reasons set out below, I find that he did not fail to take reasonable care and that he was not at fault for the collision\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  The defendants' overarching submission is that the plaintiff should have reassessed the circumstances of the Code 3 call once it became apparent at the Chilko Dr. intersection that he would not be the first officer on the scene of the collapsed overpass. They say he made an error in judgment in putting too much emphasis on timing\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  I find that the plaintiff did conduct a proper risk assessment in responding to the emergency call. From the limited information the plaintiff had, he knew the situation was very serious; he knew that it was unknown for injuries and that time was of the essence. The Code 3 call had not been cancelled prior to the collision. I accept his evidence that officers are to continue as dispatched until a Code 3 call is cancelled. Moreover, it is an uncontroverted fact that he reduced his speed after passing the police blockade at the Chilko Dr. intersection\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "65  The defendants assert that the plaintiff was negligent as he approached the accident scene. They argue that:\n",
      "he was negligent in his choice of lane;\n",
      "he should have proceeded more cautiously and he lacked an appreciation for U-turning vehicles in a chaotic emergency situation;\n",
      "he was travelling too fast in all the circumstances; and\n",
      "he should not have laid down his motorcycle\n",

      "Choice of Lan\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "67  The defendants forcefully argue that the plaintiff was negligent in choosing to travel down the median. They submit that he acted unreasonably because he was travelling through the blind-spots of the drivers in the inside northbound lane\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  I reject that submission. It is not reasonable to require the plaintiff in responding to an emergency call to travel in a lane that would have entirely avoided the blind-spots of those drivers executing turns or lane changes. Rather, the analysis of whether his choice of lane was reasonable requires consideration of what reasonable options were available to the plaintiff at the time\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "69  With respect to the defendants' contention that the plaintiff should have travelled on the shoulder of the northbound lane, I note that the evidence from the defendant himself was that there were vehicles, including a motorcycle, moving through that lane, and that there were abandoned parked cars on the shoulder. In those circumstances, I am not persuaded that it would have been prudent for the plaintiff to travel in the shoulder of the northbound lane\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "70  Moreover, it is significant that the traffic was stalled in the northbound lane. If the plaintiff had chosen, instead of driving down the median, to continue to split the traffic by travelling north between the two northbound lanes of stopped traffic, he likely would not have had an unimpeded route of travel. The defendant himself testified that some of the drivers of the vehicles stopped in the northbound lanes were exiting their vehicles. If any occupant of a vehicle, either on the passenger side of the left lane or the driver side of the right lane, opened their door without checking their blind-spot, the door would have opened directly in front of the plaintiff's vehicle. Moreover, he would have been passing through the blind-spots of the drivers in the shoulder lane\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  Lastly, proceeding northbound in the southbound lane would have presented its own set of hazards, because despite the downed overpass, there were vehicles travelling in a southerly direction in those lanes\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "73  I next address whether the plaintiff nonetheless should have taken more care for his own safety by recognizing the potential risks of vehicles in the northbound lane negotiating U-turns. I find that the plaintiff did appreciate that there were vehicles doing U-turns from the northbound lane through the median to travel south in the southbound lanes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "74  In all the circumstances, I am unable to conclude that he failed to take reasonable care. He did what was reasonable in terms of activating all of his emergency equipment: the evidence shows that his sirens and his flashing lights were on, and that he was repeatedly blowing his air-horn. He did so to be seen and heard. Significantly, both Mr. K. and Ms. O., who were in the vehicles directly in front of and behind the defendants' truck, observed the approach of the plaintiff and remained stopped in their respective positions.\n",
      "(iii) Travelling at an Excessive Spee\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "75  The plaintiff, in responding to a high-priority emergency call with his lights and sirens activated, was travelling in a path where traffic should not lawfully be travelling. I turn to the defendants' submission that in these circumstances, the plaintiff was travelling too fast\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "76  Mr. SE. opined that the initial speed of the motorcycle was between 51 and 76 kilometres per hour if the front and rear brakes had been applied. Had only the rear brakes been applied, the pre-braking speed would have been between 51 and 63 kilometres per hour. I accept the plaintiff's evidence that he applied both the front and rear brakes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "77  In opining on the speed of the motorcycle, neither expert had complete data or considered all of the factors necessary to provide a thorough scientific analysis. This is reflected in the range of estimates they provided. The conjecture elicited in cross-examination as to the possible variables that might impact the calculations was of little assistance to the Court. In the circumstances, while I have considered the expert evidence, I have not relied on it exclusively in making my findings of fact\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "78  Both Ms. O. and Mr. K. estimated the plaintiff's speed at 50 to 60 kilometres per hour. I have approached this evidence cautiously as each of them made this estimate based on a very brief observation. However, there is no evidence suggesting that either of them were aware of the other's testimony in this regard. The plaintiff estimated his speed as 40 to 50 kilometres per hour. The plaintiff's unchallenged evidence is that prior to reaching the Chilko Dr. intersection, he was proceeding at 80 to 90 kilometres per hour. He then slowed down appreciably to pass the roadblock at the Chilko Dr. intersection. By virtue of his training and experience, I find the plaintiff would have been particularly attuned to his speed. Although he candidly admitted that he did not check his speedometer after passing through the intersection, as I referred to earlier, I accept his evidence that thereafter he proceeded at a reduced speed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "79  Based on the totality of the evidence, I am unable to make a finding as to the precise speed of the motorcycle prior to the application of the brakes. I am satisfied that the evidence supports a finding that it is more likely than not that the plaintiff was travelling in the range of 55 to 70 kilometres per hour. In all the circumstances, I conclude that the speed at which the plaintiff was travelling was justified in the context of the duty to which he was responding. Even if the plaintiff was travelling at 80 kilometres per hour, I would not be persuaded this constituted a breach of the plaintiff's statutory duty.\n",
      "(iv) \"Laying Down\" the Motorcycl\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  Counsel for the defendants also suggested that the plaintiff, when suddenly confronted with a very dangerous situation in which he had to react in a split-second timeframe, should have kept his motorcycle upright. In Dhah v. Harris, , the plaintiff motorcyclist was struck by a pick-up truck driven by the defendant who had made a U-turn across a double yellow line. The observations of the court at para. 34 are apt in this case:\n",
      "Similarly, the plaintiff may, in hindsight, have had alternate courses of action open to him, although there is no evidence that they would have made a difference. However, he did not have the luxury of carefully considering all his options. He reacted to the sudden appearance of a dangerous situation in front of him\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "81  I conclude that at the speed the plaintiff was travelling, he could not have reasonably taken any evasive action that would have avoided the accident. The evidence establishes that the plaintiff had no escape route, and his only option to mitigate the severity of the collision was to lay down the motorcycle. The motorcycle went down on its left side, which shows that the plaintiff applied counter-steering and steered the motorcycle in the direction he intended. He could not have swerved to the right because he would have collided with the vehicles behind the defendants' truck. If he had swerved to the left, it would have likely only changed the location of the impact with the truck.\n",
      "Conclusio\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "82  The plaintiff was exercising his privileges as a police officer pursuant to s. 122 of the MVA, travelling on the roadway where he would not otherwise be allowed to travel. I find that he did so having due regard for his own safety and the safety of the public. He considered the relevant factors and exercised appropriate judgment in balancing the risks against the utility of his conduct\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  The plaintiff was aware that it was important for him to remain visible, to maintain time and space for an escape route, and to keep in mind his own safety as well as the public's safety. He proceeded with reasonable caution: he did not travel at an excessive speed, he kept a proper lookout ahead, and he activated all of his emergency equipment in an effort to make drivers aware of his presence and to arrive at the scene of the collapsed overpass as quickly and safely as possible in the circumstances. He recognized the possibility that a driver in whose blind spot he was travelling might do a U-turn and took the precaution of activating all of his emergency equipment. It was reasonable to assume that upon his approach the drivers in the northbound lanes would obey the law and stop and remain in their positions until he passed: Mills v. Seifred,  at para. 26\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  In short, his conduct, viewed objectively from the viewpoint of a reasonable police officer, was reasonable in all the circumstances\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  The onus was on the defendants to establish contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff on a balance of probabilities. On the totality of the evidence, they have failed to discharge that onus\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  I conclude on a balance of probabilities that the defendant, Mr. Y., caused the accident by his negligence, and that his negligence was the sole cause of the collision. The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent. The defendants are wholly liable for the plaintiff's damages.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "87  It is uncontroversial that the accident caused the plaintiff's injuries and that he is entitled to damages as a result of the injuries he sustained. Before addressing the damages analysis, I turn to the facts established on the evidence. I will first address the facts relating to the plaintiff's personal circumstances and will then address the medical evidence and the evidence of the occupational therapists.\n",

      "88  Prior to the collision the plaintiff was a healthy and exceptionally physically fit 43-year-old RCMP officer\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "89  He began his career in law enforcement at a young age. After a brief period of being a member of a regional police force in Ontario, in 1984, the plaintiff became a member of the Canadian military police. He pursued career advancement and eventually achieved the rank of master corporal in the military police. He thrived on the teamwork, camaraderie, and mental and physical challenges provided by the military environment and earned a number of certificates for his achievements\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "90  In 1991, the plaintiff applied for and was accepted into the Canadian Airborne Regiment, which at that time was the paramount combat unit in Canada. The training to become a parachutist was extremely rigorous; for instance, once a year, he attended an intense week-long course on surviving capture and torture. The plaintiff spent a total of two and a half years with the Canadian Airborne Regiment and he held the rank of corporal. Throughout this period, he maintained his excellent physical condition and pursued his passion for outdoor activities, including hunting, fishing, camping and canoeing\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "91  After a posting with the Special Investigations Unit in Calgary in 1993, he was posted to Tokyo, Japan. His role as an attaché in the Canadian Embassy security guard unit was to ensure the safety of personnel at the Canadian consulate. During this time, he competed with professional and elite-level amateur athletes in three different types of triathlons and regularly participated in Kendo (Japanese sword-fighting), running, biking, and swimming. He eventually met and married his wife in Japan. They shared a common interest in hiking and camping endeavours which were very physically challenging. During his posting in Japan, the Canadian Airborne Regiment was disbanded\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "92  In 1997, the plaintiff returned with his wife to British Columbia, where he worked as a member of the military police at the Canadian Armed Forces base in Comox. He competed on the military police team in the surf and sea competition, which involved skiing, running, biking, and canoeing\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "93  In 1999, the plaintiff was assigned to work with the Joint Task Force II, Canada's counter-terrorist unit. After being attached to a brigade with NATO in Bosnia for one and a half months, he was assigned to Kosovo for a seven-month placement. In Kosovo, he saw combat and was involved with UN investigations of war crimes. From his testimony, it is clear this was an extremely gruelling placement, from both a mental and a physical perspective\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "94  After returning from Kosovo, it became apparent to him that he inevitably would be posted to Afghanistan. For personal reasons, including wanting to start a family, the plaintiff, after 18 years of service, decided to leave the Canadian military and to apply to the RCMP. Given his prior experience and outstanding level of fitness, he excelled at the RCMP training facility in Regina. This was despite the fact that at age 40, he was older than his fellow trainees\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "95  After completing his training, he was posted to work at the Coquitlam RCMP detachment, where he worked as an RCMP officer from September 2002 until the date of the collision. His stated career goal, given his experience and skill set, was to join the RCMP Emergency Response Team (\"ERT\"), which is the special tactics division of the RCMP. During his posting with the Coquitlam detachment, he worked various overtime shifts with the ERT and found the challenge satisfying\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "96  After a year of performing general duties as an RCMP officer, the plaintiff was asked to join the traffic section of the Coquitlam detachment. He was selected to participate in the advanced motorcycle operator course. I accept that he did not complete the first motorcycle operator course because of the handling and mechanical difficulties with the motorcycle assigned to him. As referred to earlier, he successfully completed the course in the spring of 2005, after being issued a Harley Davidson motorcycle. The plaintiff enjoyed being a motorcycle officer and was passionate about his work\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "97  The evidence of the plaintiff's wife, Mr. S., and Mr. L., whose evidence on this point I found reliable without exception, all support the finding that prior to the collision, the plaintiff was an extremely active individual who excelled at a wide range of athletic pursuits. The plaintiff has been passionate about the outdoors since his youth; his pre-collision activities included regular hiking, fishing, canoeing and camping. He was an avid hunter and, prior to the collision, he was able to hunt alone and carry all of his own equipment. He had participated in competitive archery; he was ranked in the World Police and Fire Games for three different types of archery\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "99  The impact of the collision threw the plaintiff into the air. As referred to earlier, by virtue of his military training and in an effort to minimize his injuries, he made a conscious effort to tuck himself into a ball before landing on the pavement. After impact, he recalled lying on his back on the pavement, struggling to breathe, with intense pain radiating from his hips and lower back. He was conscious and observed that people had come to assist him. He described his pain as \"pure pain\" which caused him to see \"white light\". The emergency personnel administered morphine on the scene and he was transported by ambulance to the hospital\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "100  The attending orthopaedic surgeon at the hospital, Dr. D., advised the plaintiff that he had sustained a spinal injury which would require surgery. The plaintiff was distraught about the prospect of potential paralysis. The plaintiff experienced a very negative reaction to the morphine and the other pain killers which were administered to him\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "101  The plaintiff underwent surgery on July 21, 2005, after which Dr. D. explained to the plaintiff that he had a burst fracture in his vertebrae in the thoracolumbar region, and that metal rods, clamps and screws had been placed in the area to fuse the spine together. The plaintiff was fitted with a clamshell brace in order to stabilize his fused spine and prevent him from moving. He was not allowed to sit or stand up unless he was wearing this brace. He used a walker to manoeuvre around the hospital. After physiotherapy treatments, he was able to walk short distances, go to the bathroom, and get in and out of his hospital bed. He was released from the hospital on July 27, 2005\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "102  Shortly after his discharge, an occupational therapist, Ms. R., on behalf of the RCMP, visited the plaintiff's home. She evaluated his comfort and safety needs and arranged for the necessary equipment to facilitate his recovery\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "103  At home the plaintiff managed his pain with Tylenol-3s. During his initial recovery, he experienced difficulty sleeping due to his back pain and spasms; he eventually obtained sleeping pills to assist him with sleeping\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "104  The plaintiff made an extraordinary effort to build up his strength and maximize his recovery. Eventually, he improved sufficiently that he could go for short walks with his wife and daughter. By the end of September 2005, he was no longer using prescription painkillers and was able to walk for approximately 1.5 hours per day. He does not subscribe to the use of pain medication unless absolutely necessary. As of October 2005, Dr. D. permitted him to \"wean himself\" out of his brace. The records indicate that by November 2005, he was driving and only using a cane for support when walking uphill. The plaintiff attended physiotherapy from November 2005 until April 2006 for mobilization and strengthening of his thoracolumbar spine\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "105  Within a year of the accident, the plaintiff was walking regularly and following physiotherapy exercises at home. After completing a mock RCMP Physical Abilities Requirement Evaluation (\"PARE\"), the plaintiff returned to work in April 2006 in the Coquitlam detachment on a graduated schedule for a two-month period. However he never resumed his former front-line policing duties. In the spring of 2006, he eventually moved into a new position which was less physical and more administrative in nature; this is described in the next section\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "106  The plaintiff described the anxiety and fear he experienced because of his injury. I accept that the first year following his collision was very difficult for him. He was fearful that he would not be able to return to work or only to work in a limited capacity, and that he would have no way to provide for his family. I also accept his wife's evidence that during this period, he was uncharacteristically negative and short-tempered.\n",
      "(iii) Plaintiff's Circumstances at Tria\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "107  The plaintiff currently works for the RCMP as a firearms support investigator with the National Weapons Enforcement Support Team. His duties are much more administrative in nature than prior to the collision. He primarily works in an office and his job duties include training frontline police officers in investigating firearms offences and firearm trafficking, writing sentencing reports, and preparing court documents. He drives to sites and attends the execution of search warrants, but does not do so in any capacity that would require the apprehension of suspects. He has not returned to a front-line general duty policing position; he cannot assume the risk of any physical altercations because of the physical limitations imposed by his fused back. He misses the opportunity for interaction with the public that his general duty position offered; he clearly derived satisfaction from those interactions\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "108  He regularly works Monday through Thursday. He requires regular breaks from sitting throughout the day. His stamina is reduced; he is physically and mentally exhausted by the end of the workweek. He has been accommodated in that he is permitted to work at home as required because of his problems with his back\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "109  His sleep pattern has largely normalized. However, when he goes to bed, it takes him some time for his back to loosen and his back pain symptoms will typically wake him in the early morning\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "110  The plaintiff has returned to some of his pre-collision recreational activities, such as hunting, fishing, and canoeing, but in a greatly modified capacity. Against the recommendation of his instructor, he competed in an archery competition in 2009, but because of his limitations, he used a lighter wooden bow which had been tuned down. The evidence was unclear as to whether he is currently participating in archery. He attends the gym but is restricted in terms of weight-lifting and he cannot do sit-ups. On medical advice he has not returned to running, cycling or swimming. He has gained weight since the collision\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "111  I accept the plaintiff's evidence, that the nature of his hunting endeavours have been modified dramatically. For the most part, he cannot do any of the heavy lifting, and his companions do what they can to accommodate him. His fishing activities have also been modified because of his limitations with heavy lifting and his difficulties remaining seated in the boat. With respect to camping, prior to the collision he typically slept on the ground, lifted and carried heavy items and hiked up steep terrain. After the collision, he is unable to sleep on the ground; on a camping trip with his wife and daughter, the family had to return home early because he could not tolerate a third night of sleeping in the uncomfortable environment. He has now purchased a tent-trailer and has been able to continue camping with his family\n",
      "======\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "115  It is common ground that as a result of the collision, the plaintiff sustained an injury to his thoracolumbar spine -- a pincer burst fracture at T12. The vertebra was shattered into two large pieces and multiple smaller fragments. He also sustained some superficial contusions and abrasions.\n",
      "Dr. D\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "116  On July 21, 2005, Dr. D., who has been an orthopaedic surgeon for over 30 years, performed an instrumented fusion of the plaintiff's lumbar-spine from T11 to L3 with bone graphing from T12 to L2. Pedicle titanium rods and screws were used to stabilize two levels above and below the fracture site. This prevented the spine from collapsing. After his surgery, the plaintiff was stabilized and fitted with a custom-made clamshell brace with Velcro straps\n",

      "\n",
      "117  During his February 28, 2006 and June 20, 2006 consultations with the plaintiff, Dr. D. noted stiffness in the plaintiff's lumbar spine which was consistent with the fusion\n",

      "\n",
      "118  In December 2008, while he was swimming, the plaintiff developed severe right thoracolumbar pain extending into his right foot and numbness extending into his right buttock. He did take anti-inflammatory medication. His family doctor referred him to Dr. D., who in May 2009 diagnosed mechanical back pain. The physical examination revealed some spasm as well as some flattening and stiffness of the plaintiff's thoracolumbar spine. Dr. D. advised the plaintiff to maintain cardiovascular, core strengthening and range of motion exercises\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "119  Dr. D. has not seen the plaintiff since May 2009. He prepared a report dated January 20, 2010, at the request of plaintiff's counsel\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "120  I accept Dr. D.'s opinion, and indeed it is not seriously disputed by the defendants, that as a result of the injuries sustained in the collision, the plaintiff is \"permanently disabled insofar as repetitive heavy bending, lifting and twisting movements are concerned within his spine\". Dr. D. clarified in his testimony that this included \"doing arrests out in the patrol car\", motorcycle-riding, heavy gardening work and performing heavy home maintenance and repairs. In his opinion, the plaintiff is not disabled from performing modified employment duties. His prognosis for the plaintiff is \"fairly good\". He recommends that the plaintiff maintain his own active, independent exercise program in order to preserve the flexibility of his thoracolumbar spine as much as possible and to maintain his trunk, core and abdominal muscle strength\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "121  Dr. D. opined that in order to relieve the plaintiff's pain there is a possibility of a future surgery to remove the pedicle screws and rods from his spine. Dr. D. affirmed that the hardware in the spine can cause pain, which Dr. D. described as a \"dull roar in the background\" and that daily activities can make the pain worse. He explained that removal of hardware usually will reduce the pain but does not eliminate it. His opinion with respect to the removal of the hardware from the plaintiff's back is as follows:\n",
      "In my opinion, it is possible that consideration might be given to removal of the pedicle screws and rods from his thoracolumbar spine. The risks of such a surgery include the general anaesthetic and also include the small possibility of a postoperative infection. It is unlikely that there would be any nerve compromise or injury as a result of this possible hardware removal procedure.\n",
      "I anticipate that this removal of the hardware may be helpful in the relief of some localized pain within the thoracolumbar area thereby improving his overall activity and tolerance. I do not anticipate that this surgery would affect his ability to perform his usual employment duties and activities of daily living once convalescence has been completed after such a surgical procedure.\n",
      "Dr. D. was of the opinion that based on the plaintiff's reported pain levels as of May, 2009, further surgery was a possibility; however, if the plaintiff's pain increases, surgery would be more likely.\n",
      "(ii) Dr. H\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "122  Dr. H. is a medical doctor with a specialty in physical medicine and rehabilitation. He has practiced as a specialist since 1985. He assessed the plaintiff on September 5, 2007\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "123  Dr. H. diagnosed increased tightness or stiffness and loss of range of motion in the plaintiff's lower back, which increases with heavy physical activities. His prognosis was a permanent abnormal tightness in the plaintiff's lower back which results in difficulty getting up from immobile positions, running or lifting. He explained that a severe and permanent injury to the spine such as that sustained by the plaintiff results in the body developing reflexes to tighten the surrounding muscles to protect the injured area. In the result, the tissues surrounding the plaintiff's spinal fusion have become tighter. The plaintiff is at increased risk of injury and reinjury to his spine. He also opined that the plaintiff's injuries increase the risk of him developing arthritis in his spine because of the increased loading on the two ends of the fusion; however, he also acknowledged that the development of arthritis does not inevitably result in increased pain or disability\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "124  Dr. H. recommended that in order to protect his spine, the plaintiff should limit his work tasks and sports activities to those that do not involve repetitive heavy lifting or movements that send impulsive forces through the spine, such as running and jumping. He also opined that the plaintiff is more likely to experience pain, fatigue, and tightness if he engages in repetitive tasks. The plaintiff does not have the same flexibility, endurance, or the capability of exerting force on his spine that he did prior to the collision\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "125  Dr. H. disagrees with Dr. L.'s opinion that the plaintiff's lower back pain \"will not appreciably increase with time\". I found Dr. H.'s explanation persuasive and prefer his opinion. I accept that there is a likelihood that the natural aging process will impact the plaintiff's symptoms because as he ages he likely will not be able to maintain conditioning and the strength of the supporting anatomical structures of his spine.\n",

At the time of her report, she opined that the plaintiff would make a full recovery and would be able to resume his normal home and leisure activities. She based her opinion on his own positive presentation and the steady progress he had made in his recovery up to October 2006. She subsequently changed her opinion and testified that her initial prognosis was overly optimistic. She stated that the hardware in his back can cause pain and increased symptoms in the winter months when it is cold. She opined that his back pain and discomfort will persist indefinitely\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "128  Consistent with Dr. D. and Dr. H.'s recommendation, she recommends that the plaintiff permanently avoid work with heavy physical demands, and avoid repetitive lifting and impact activities such as running and jumping. She stated that given his restrictions, the plaintiff had been unable to maintain his former level of physical and cardiovascular fitness and noted that his weight gain since the collision was a reflection of the challenges he faced in this regard\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "129  She also opined that the plaintiff's back is permanently more vulnerable to injury, and even if he is careful, he is at an increased risk of developing degenerative disc disease. Although this may or may not become symptomatic, it usually results in increased pain and decreased ability to participate in physical activities.\n",

The plaintiff reported stabbing pain in his lower back on March 9, 2007. In December 2008, the plaintiff reported severe thoracolumbar pain, with intense pain into his right leg and buttock, which was aggravated by certain movements such as using stairs. Dr. T. ordered x-rays and referred the plaintiff back to Dr. D. This flare-up persisted for some months. In December 2009, the plaintiff again reported shooting pain in his lower back\n",

It is his medical opinion that the plaintiff should not run or swim. He will also be permanently limited in terms of heavier household cleaning, maintenance repairs, renovating, and gardening. In his final report Dr. T. states that he foresees the possibility of future surgery to remove the hardware from the plaintiff's spine because the plaintiff is experiencing increased symptoms during the winter time.\n",

      "The examinee's current functional level and minimal low back pain complaints, the past history of extreme fitness, this physical examination and the submitted functional capacity evaluation all support the probability that the spine injury has not significantly diminished Mr. [X.]'s ability to perform the full duties as an RCMP officer including performing up to standard for a [46] year old police officer in any physical encounter (fighting, retraining).\n",
      "It would be assumed that prolonged driving a car or motorcycle would trigger low back pain. Also low back pain is likely to be experienced in the rare instance of physical combat.\n",

      "135  It is his opinion that \"there will be an increased stress at least at the L2-L3 intervertebral level with the probability of a moderate acceleration of the normal intervertebral disc degenerative process at this level\" (emphasis added). He also opines as follows:\n",
      "Despite this change at the spinal level below the fusion, it is probable that Mr. [X.]'s low back pain, that he will experience indefinitely due to the spinal fracture, will not appreciably increase with time and not interfere with his performing the essential duties as an RCMP officer for his remaining eligible working years. This latter conclusion is supported by his minimal back pain complaints at this time and his history of maintaining top physical conditioning. This physical conditioning will combat the risk of deconditioning (a well known contributing factor for low back pain)\n",
      "Mr. [X.] should be able to take part in the vast majority of physical activities he was engaged in prior to the accident but at a reduced level as a pain reduction measure. His lack of maintaining exceptional fitness since the accident will most probably result in the examinee not reaching the same peak as prior to the injury.\n",
      "It is most probable that further surgical intervention, such as hardware removal, will not be necessary as a result of the spinal fracture of July 19, 2005.\n",

      "With regard to Mr. [X.]'s pre-accident job as a police officer according to the National Occupational Classification (NOC) this job (#6261) requires: sitting, standing, walking, multiple limb co-ordination and Heavy strength. Additionally, Mr. [X.] described the requirement for running, jumping and restraining, as well as riding a motor cycle for work in Traffic Service.\n",
      "Based on the results of this assessment, Mr. [X.] is considered borderline for meeting the demands of this work. He demonstrates basic tolerances for sitting, standing, walking, multiple limb co-ordination and into the heavy strength range, but is likely not durable for extended periods of standing and for heavy strength application outside of neutral trunk positioning. He is also likely not durable for impact activity. Given the nature of his work and need to respond at full capacity these limitations are likely significant for full policing duties. Additionally, medical recommendations for heavy strength application and impact should be clarified.\n",
      "Mr. [X.] has returned to work with the RCMP in an investigative capacity in the National Weapons Enforcement Project. He described this work to include periods of office work where demands are largely sedentary, as well as periods of site work which can involve greater mobility and body dexterity, as well as strength demands in the light to medium range. Based on the results of this assessment he meets the described physical demands for this work. In some situation he may experience symptom aggravation or have to pace/alter his positioning but this appears to be manageable in the current work situation as described by Mr. [X.].\n",
      "Mr. [X.] identifies concern regarding finding himself called into more physical policing demands in the course of his weapons investigation duties and/or his employer transferring him to other duties that exceed his tolerances. The likelihood of this would need clarification. As stated above he is not considered durable for full policing duties. [Emphasis added.]\n",

      "Conclusion Regarding Plaintiff's Conditio\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "147  It is uncontroversial that the plaintiff suffered a serious injury in the accident: a fractured spine which required surgical fusion with metal instrumentation. The medical evidence clearly establishes that he is permanently disabled insofar as repetitive heavy bending, lifting and high-impact activities. He has an increased risk for the development or acceleration of degenerative disc disease and is at an increased susceptibility for reinjuring his back\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "148  However, the assessment of the consequences of that injury on the plaintiff and, in particular, the symptoms he continues to experience now and in the future are very much in dispute. It therefore falls to this Court to assess the severity of his persisting symptoms and the likelihood that he will experience an increase in the severity of his symptoms in the future\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "149  As was affirmed by the medical witnesses in this trial, the interpretation, reporting and assessment of the level of pain of any given individual is, at its core, a very subjective exercise. The medical opinions as to prognosis have been largely based on the back pain symptoms reported by the plaintiff himself. The observations of the court in Fan v. Chana,  at para. 73, are apt in this case:\n",
      "... As courts have observed on any number of occasions, the approach taken by medical professionals is not forensic: they assume that the patient is accurately reporting to them and then set about a diagnosis that plausibly fits the pattern of the complaint\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "150  In the end, the assessment of the plaintiff's back pain ultimately turns on the Court's assessment of the plaintiff's credibility and the consistency of his evidence at trial with the information he previously communicated to the various healthcare professionals who treated and assessed him: Edmondson v. Payer,  at para. 21. At this juncture, it is therefore appropriate to comment on the plaintiff's credibility\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "151  The defendants, although conceding that the plaintiff was largely a credible witness, submitted that on the fundamental issues, he embellished and coloured his injuries, and that he was attempting to colour his function and injuries in a way that was not accurate. In assessing credibility, the defendants urge the Court to consider the level of the plaintiff's return to function after the injury. Furthermore, the defendants say that after his initial recovery from surgery, the plaintiff did not report any pain other than episodic flare-ups to various healthcare professionals. They point out that after 2006, Dr. T. has not referred the plaintiff for either physiotherapy or massage therapy, nor has the plaintiff been prescribed pain medications since the fall of 2005\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "152  The evidence shows that since the collision, the plaintiff has consistently reported symptoms of stiffness, tightness and discomfort to the various healthcare professionals. The common theme that emerges from the evidence is that the plaintiff, particularly in the first few years after the accident, minimized his symptoms in the course of his self-reporting. Ms. Q. described the plaintiff as being \"very much an RCMP officer\" in that he avoided complaining to her about pain or limitations, and was hesitant to admit activities that he was unable to complete. Ms. R., whom I found to be professional and objective in her assessment, was of the view that the plaintiff minimized reporting his symptoms and difficulties and pushed himself to get as far as he could in his recovery. Ms. T. confirmed that he demonstrated higher levels of effort and exhibited competitive behaviour in the functional capacity assessment\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "153  There was much made at the trial of the numeric pain scale of 1-10, with 10 being the worst pain. I have considered that the plaintiff's military experiences may have impacted his interpretation of the pain rating scale and his characterization and communication of the degree of pain he has experienced. In his functional capacity assessment with Ms. Q. in 2007, the plaintiff described his pain as 1-2; but this must be assessed in the context of his description in 2008 to Ms. T. of stabbing pain as 2-4 on the pain scale. At the trial, the plaintiff described his \"normal\" pain as level 4, which he compared to the sensation of someone putting a foot on his back. He sometimes experiences tingling in his right buttock which he compared to a \"fork being jammed\" into him. This sometimes causes an increase in pain to a 5-6 out of 10. During the course of the testimony which was given over some seven days, the plaintiff required frequent breaks. He frequently switched between standing and sitting positions. He described feeling \"beat down\" and tired from sitting too long\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "154  I have concluded that the plaintiff was highly motivated after the collision, and made a genuine and extraordinary attempt to overcome his injuries and to minimize their impact on his lifestyle. Given his training and background, he is a man whose temperament is to \"grin and bear it\". In particular, in the first few years following the accident, he was reluctant to complain about his pain; his tendency was to minimize the suffering he had endured. The plaintiff says that he has experienced the worst pain, being a 10, and that he had previously described his less severe symptoms as discomfort. I accept his explanation that the 1-2 ratings he reported to Ms. Q. in 2007 are equivalent to what he subsequently described at trial as level-4 pain. His expression of his discomfort and pain has gradually evolved over time to a more realistic presentation. I find no significant discrepancy between his evidence at trial and the information he had previously communicated to others. I have made these findings notwithstanding his self-reporting of \"no pain\" at various times to some of the healthcare professionals he saw\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "155  Overall, I found the plaintiff to be a credible witness. In the face of a very thorough cross-examination, I found his evidence as a whole forthright and consistent. The plaintiff struck me as a proud and honourable man who has served his country and his community with distinction. He presented as a stoic individual with a brave demeanour who has struggled with accepting the reality of his limitations. I have considered all of the defendants' examples of what they assert are inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence, including as those allegations relate to him shooting an elk on an October 2006 hunting trip, and his mandatory RCMP periodic health assessments. I do not regard all of the examples as constituting inconsistencies. Moreover, I am not persuaded that the inconsistencies that can be found are particularly significant in the context of all of the evidence. I do not agree that these inconsistencies demonstrate that the plaintiff attempted to mislead the Court or exaggerate the extent and nature of his injuries\n",

      "158  Corporal L., a colleague of the plaintiff, described the plaintiff prior to the collision to be \"in phenomenal physical shape\". After the collision, he observed that the plaintiff was \"not the same person\". He walked more slowly and appeared stiff. He also described his temperament as being \"short and not as friendly\" as before the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "159  Mr. L., the plaintiff's former archery coach, who I found to be an exceptionally sincere witness, described the plaintiff prior to the accident as \"standing tall and walking proud\" and with \"a very positive mental outlook\". After the accident, he described the plaintiff's walk as being \"hunched forward with stooped shoulders\". Mr. L. has also observed a change in the plaintiff's demeanour; he is more withdrawn and \"short\" and he tires more easily\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "160  Sergeant P., the plaintiff's former supervisor, described the plaintiff prior to the accident as a go-getter, very mature, competent and extremely committed to police work. Since the accident, he has observed on occasion that the plaintiff's back was obviously bothering him and that he had to sit down more frequently. The plaintiff also complained to him about his back problems\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "161  According to the plaintiff's wife, if he stays in certain positions for any length of time, he complains of spasm and discomfort. He has lower levels of energy and tires easily\n",

      "162  A careful review of the videotape surveillance submitted by the defendants does not demonstrate any inconsistencies with my findings\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "163  In summary on this issue, I find that the plaintiff's symptoms are genuine. He regularly experiences varying degrees of pain and significant stiffness, tightness, and spasms in his back. The cold exacerbates his symptoms. He will continue to experience episodic aggravation of his symptoms. He is at an increased risk of developing degenerative arthritis and he has an increased susceptibility for further injury to his back. He also faces the possibility of another surgery to remove the hardware in his back. He has reduced stamina and tires much more easily than prior to the collision. I also conclude that as the plaintiff ages, there is a substantial likelihood that his pain and discomfort will increase because he will not be able to maintain the same level of conditioning in the muscles supporting the fused area of his back\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "164  In terms of his career, the preponderance of the evidence clearly supports a finding that the plaintiff is not fit to perform the full range of policing duties. He must avoid impact activities and any risk of physical altercations with suspects, which restricts him from participation in front-line policing duties. He can no longer perform the duties of a motorcycle officer, nor is he able to pursue his ambition to join the ERT as an operational member.\n",

The defendants submit that non-pecuniary damages should be assessed at approximately $100,000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "167  The objective of non-pecuniary damages is to compensate a plaintiff's pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. The award is to compensate a plaintiff for those damages he has suffered up to the date of the trial and for those he will suffer in the future. The essential principle derived from the authorities is that an award for non-pecuniary damages must be fair and reasonable to both parties and should be measured by the adverse impact of the particular injuries on the individual plaintiff\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "168  The B.C. Court of Appeal in Stapley v. Hejslet,  at para. 46, enumerated the factors to be considered in awarding non-pecuniary damages. The non-exhaustive list includes: the age of the plaintiff; the nature of the injury; the severity and duration of pain; the degree of disability; the impairment of family, marital, and social relationships; and loss of lifestyle. While fairness is assessed by reference to awards made in comparable cases, it is impossible to develop a \"tariff\"; each case is decided on its own unique facts: Lindal v. Lindal,  at 637\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "169  It cannot be overstated that the assessment of non-pecuniary damages is necessarily influenced by the individual plaintiff's personal experiences in dealing with his injuries and their consequences, and the plaintiff's ability to articulate that experience: Dilello v. Montgomery,  at para. 25\n",
      "======\n",

      "\n",
      "171  In terms of his enjoyment of athletics, his lifelong outdoor pursuits have been significantly curtailed. His injuries have restricted his participation in many recreational activities and competitive athletic endeavours that he pursued so passionately prior to the collision. He is a former triathlete with a considerable competitive drive who is no longer able to run, cycle or swim. He derived considerable pleasure from his excellence at athletic pursuits and that was a vital component of his identity. He prided himself on his ability to protect others and to embrace any type of challenge\n",
      "======\n",

      "\n",
      "173  His injuries have also impacted his family life; the plaintiff's limitations have inevitably created a strain on his marriage. He can no longer perform heavier household tasks such as heavy gardening, cleaning, maintenance, and repairs. He is unable to do many physical and recreational activities such as skiing and the more strenuous hiking and camping that he and his wife had previously enjoyed doing together\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "174  Significantly, the plaintiff has been unable to lift up his young daughter since the collision, which has created a genuine emotional strain on him. He also clearly finds it distressing that he is and will continue to be unable to participate with his daughter in the more adventurous physical and recreational activities that, but for his injury, he would have pursued\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "175  The totality of the evidence supports a finding that prior to the collision, he was a very stable individual with an outgoing personality and a very positive outlook. He now faces uncertainty about the potential for deterioration and is burdened with anxiety regarding his future. He struggles with episodic bouts of frustration and irritability. He is more withdrawn in his social interactions. Prior to the collision, he was a very energetic and enthusiastic individual; Corporal B. described him as a \"go-getter\". As a consequence of coping with his condition, he now suffers from markedly reduced stamina and increased fatigue\n",

      "176  The plaintiff, similar to the plaintiff in Easton v. Chrunka,  at para. 21, is \"neither a complainer nor a malingerer\"; rather, when faced with a challenge, his character demanded that he \"tough it out\". Although he has endured significant pain and discomfort, he exhibited considerable perseverance and fortitude in his efforts to resume his pre-collision lifestyle and to engage in as many of his pre-collision activities as he could. It would be unjust if the Court did not recognize the reality of the adverse impact of his injuries and loss of enjoyment of life that he has and will continue to endure. As Kirkpatrick J. observes in Stapley at para. 46, a plaintiff should not, generally speaking, be penalized for their stoicism\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "181  The position of the defendants is that:\n",
      "the plaintiff should not be awarded any damages for loss of future earning capacity because the evidence does not establish that there is any real and substantial possibility of a financial loss in the future;\n",
      "the plaintiff should not be awarded any damages for past wage loss because he received full wages from the RCMP when he was off work; and\n",
      "the plaintiff should be awarded $10,000 for loss of opportunity up to the date of trial.\n",
      "This head of damages represents the most significant and complex aspect of the plaintiff's claim.\n",
      "Legal Framewor\n",

      "\n",
      "182  An award for future loss of earning capacity represents compensation for a pecuniary loss: Gregory v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia,  at para. 32. The legal principle that governs this assessment for loss of earning capacity is that, insofar as is possible, the plaintiff should be put in the position he or she would have been in but for the injuries caused by the defendant's negligence: Lines v. W & D Logging Co. Ltd.,  at para. 185. Compensation must be made for the loss of earning capacity and not for the loss of earnings: Andrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd., \n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "183  The recent jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal has affirmed that the plaintiff must demonstrate both an impairment to his or her earning capacity, and that there is a real and substantial possibility that the diminishment in earning capacity will result in a pecuniary loss. If the plaintiff discharges that requirement, he or she may prove the quantification of that loss of earning capacity either on an earnings approach or a \"capital asset\" approach: Perren v. Lalari,  at para. 32. Regardless of the approach, the court must endeavour to quantify the financial harm accruing to the plaintiff over the course of his or her working career: Pett v. Pett,  at para. 19\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "184  As recently enumerated by the court in Falati v. Smith,  at para. 41, aff'd , the principles which inform the assessment of loss of earning capacity include the following:\n",
      "The standard of proof in relation to hypothetical or future events is simple probability, not the balance of probabilities: Reilly v. Lynn,  at para. 101. Hypothetical events are to be given weight according to their relative likelihood: Athey v. Leonati,  at para. 27.\n",
      "The court must make allowances for the possibility that the assumptions upon which an award is based may prove to be wrong: Milina v. Bartsch  at 79 (S.C.), aff'd  (C.A.). Evidence which supports a contingency must show a \"realistic as opposed to a speculative possibility\": Graham v. Rourke  at 636 (C.A.).\n",
      "The court must assess damages for loss of earning capacity and not calculate them mathematically: Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate  at para. 43. The overall fairness and reasonableness of the award must be considered: Rosvold v. Dunlop,  at para. 11. The assessment is based on the evidence, taking into account all positive and negative contingencies\n",

      "190  Earlier in these reasons for judgment, I concluded that the plaintiff, because of his physical limitations, can no longer discharge the full range of duties of an RCMP officer. On medical advice, he is restricted from being a motorcycle officer and from those postings which require heavy lifting, impact activity, or static or full-time standing. Moreover, he has been advised that he should not assume the risk of any physical altercation because his own safety and the safety of the public may be compromised. The plaintiff has therefore been rendered less capable overall from earning income from all types of law enforcement employment. The physical limitations caused by the injuries in the accident have reduced his career options, and have rendered him a less marketable and attractive employee\n",

Given the plaintiff's experience and skill set, I am satisfied that prior to the accident, there was a real possibility that he would have successfully applied to the ERT. I accept Sgt. P.'s evidence as to the rigorous physical requirements associated with an ERT posting and I am satisfied that this opportunity has been foreclosed to him due to his accident-related injuries. Notably, Dr. B., the physician who assessed the plaintiff in June 2007 for his periodic health assessment, deemed the plaintiff not fit for participation in the PARE required for the ERT\n",

He clearly has lost the ability to take advantage of all the employment opportunities in law enforcement that might have otherwise been open to him. However, that is only the first step in the analysis -- the critical and controversial issue is whether the evidence in this case establishes a real and substantial possibility that this impairment to the plaintiff's earning capacity will result in a future pecuniary loss. The defendants submit that given that after his recovery, the plaintiff continued to be employed by the RCMP with full compensation, there is no basis on the evidence to find that the plaintiff's loss of opportunity for joining the ERT would in itself translate into a pecuniary loss\n",

      "195  While I accept Inspector D.'s evidence as to the contents of the plaintiff's personnel file, I cannot accept the defendants' suggestion that the plaintiff is currently working without limitations and is not being accommodated. These assertions are overtaken by the reality of the plaintiff's circumstances. As I referred to earlier, his 2007 health assessment itself recognizes some limitations with his functioning. The plaintiff, since his return to work in 2006, has been working in a position that does not require strenuous physical activity and does not pose any significant risk of confrontation with suspects. The demands are largely sedentary with some site attendances involving mobility and strength demands in the light to medium range\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "196  The plaintiff testified that he is concerned about his future with the RCMP. Regular job rotations occur within each RCMP detachment based on demand and the work ethic and job performance of each officer. The usual rotation for a member is three years within each detachment, and he points out that he has been working in his current position since 2006. Therefore, he asks the Court to conclude that he may be rotated at any time to a position involving duties which he cannot perform. Moreover, he says, there are few options for him aside from his current position as a weapons support investigator; the purely administrative function of a reader is not appealing to him, and there are only limited desk jobs available within the RCMP\n",

L., once an RCMP member has attained maximum pensionable service, it is not uncommon for those RCMP members to return to the RCMP on a contract basis or to pursue law enforcement work with other agencies. While the evidence was conflicting on this point, the weight of the evidence supports a finding that members of the RCMP are now permitted to work until at least age 65\n",

He intended to return to do contract work with the RCMP or to pursue other law enforcement work after retiring from the RCMP. I find on the evidence that there is a substantial likelihood that he would have worked with the RCMP or at other law-enforcement related employment until at least age 65 and that due to his accident-related injuries, he will cease employment earlier than he otherwise would have. I find this for the following reasons\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "202  As referred to earlier, I have concluded that there is a substantial likelihood that as the plaintiff ages, he will not be able to maintain the same level of conditioning and strength in his spine. While Ms. T.'s opinion is that he could tolerate full-time sitting demands as long as he has ergonomic seating and regular breaks, I find that the plaintiff now experiences episodic symptom aggravation in his largely sedentary job. This was acknowledged by Ms. T. The plaintiff is at an increased risk of developing arthritis which may become symptomatic, and is at increased risk of re-injury. Further, a significant factor that must not be overlooked is the plaintiff's increased levels of fatigue and reduced stamina. There is a real chance that his capacity and general endurance will decrease as he ages\n",

It is not possible to pinpoint with any precision where in the range his tolerance may lie. I have considered the fact that he continues to work overtime, but in my view, this is a reflection of his work ethic and professionalism and does not impact my findings as to the age that he will likely cease working. I also conclude that due to his accident-related injuries, there is a substantial possibility he will not pursue any other employment opportunities after he leaves the RCMP. Opportunities which were otherwise realistic options for him, such as contract work with the RCMP, or investigative work, will be foreclosed to him.\n",

L. and I prefer it to the summary prepared by Corp. L. This summary, however, must be approached cautiously because it fails to take into account the plaintiff's testimony that prior to the accident, he on occasion took time off in lieu of the overtime he worked. Mr. T. confirmed that time off in lieu of pay would not be recorded on the plaintiff's payroll information. The difficulty this Court now faces is that there is no evidence of how many hours the plaintiff may have worked on this basis before or after the accident. In the result, I have not considered this as a factor in my assessment\n",

There was little in the way of reliable evidence tendered as to the plaintiff's prospects for overtime decreasing if he remains in his current position or obtains another assignment with the RCMP.

In essence, he presented a number of calculations of what the plaintiff would earn if he works with the RCMP until age 60 and what he can expect to earn if he ceases employment prior to age 60. Plaintiff's counsel properly acknowledged that these comparative illustrations are not intended to be conclusive. In any case, it must be noted that Mr. B. estimated the loss of overtime earnings based on an assumption of overtime being 20% of the plaintiff's base salary rather than looking at his actual records of earnings. In addition, the most current information in the analysis was the plaintiff's 2006 employment income. Mr. B. also provided no calculations from ages 60-65. Overall, his report on future income loss is of limited assistance to the Court.

      "The general principles underlying our system of damages suggest that a plaintiff should receive full and fair compensation, calculated to place him or her in the same position as he or she would have been had the tort not been committed, in so far as this can be achieved by a monetary award. This principle suggests that in calculating damages under the pecuniary heads, the measure of the damages should be the plaintiff's actual loss. It is implicit in this that the plaintiff should not recover unless he can demonstrate a loss, and then only to the extent of that loss. Double recovery violates this principle. It follows that where a plaintiff sustains no wage loss as a result of a tort because his employer has continued to pay his salary while he was unable to work, he should not be entitled to recover damages on that account\n",

      "These considerations suggest the following rule. As a general rule, wage benefits paid while a plaintiff is unable to work must be brought into account and deducted from the claim for lost earnings. An exception to this rule may lie where the court is satisfied that the employer or fund which paid the wage benefits is entitled to be reimbursed for them on the principle of subrogation. This is the case where statutes, such as the Workers' Compensation Act, expressly provide for payment to the benefactor of any wage benefits recovered.

      "Generally, subrogation has no relevance in a consideration of the deductibility of the disability benefits if they are found to be in the nature of insurance. However, if the benefits are not \"insurance\" then the issue of subrogation will be determinative. If the benefits are not shown to fall within the insurance exception, then they must be deducted from the wage claim that is recovered. However, if the third party who paid the benefits has a right of subrogation then there should not be any deduction. It does not matter whether the right of subrogation is exercised or not. The exercise of the right is a matter that rests solely between the plaintiff and the third party. The failure to exercise the right cannot in any way affect the defendant's liability for damages.

She affirmed that damages for the loss of housekeeping capacity may be awarded even though the plaintiff has not incurred any expense because housekeeping services were gratuitously replaced by a family member. Recovery may be allowed for both the future loss of the ability to perform household tasks as well as for the loss of such abilities prior to trial. The amount of compensation awarded must be commensurate with the plaintiff's loss: Dykeman at para. 29\n",

      "[67] ... The loss of the ability to perform household tasks requires compensation by an award measured by the value of replacement services where evidence of that value is available.\n",
      "[68] In my view, when housekeeping capacity is lost, it is to be remunerated. When family members by their gratuitous labour replace costs that would otherwise be incurred or themselves incur costs, their work can be valued by a replacement cost or opportunity cost approach as the case may be. That value provides a measure of the plaintiff's loss\n",

In Dykeman at para. 29, Madam Justice Newbury cautioned that:\n",
      "Instead, claims for gratuitous services must be carefully scrutinized, both with respect to the nature of the services - were they simply part of the usual 'give and take' between family members, or did they go 'above and beyond' that level? - and with respect to causation - were the services necessitated by the plaintiff's injuries or would they have been provided in any event\n",

      "250  Prior to the accident, it is uncontroversial that the plaintiff equally shared household duties with his wife. Immediately after the accident and spinal fusion surgery, the plaintiff was confined to bed; he was unable to do any cooking, cleaning, laundry, or other household chores. During the approximate nine-month period when he was recuperating, I accept the evidence that his wife's contribution exceeded her usual share of the household duties. I accept that the work she did went above and beyond the normal level of work done by a loving spouse. The plaintiff also paid an external housekeeping service $511.30 for work done during that time\n",

He now performs some of his pre-accident household tasks, such as cleaning the tub, with some difficulty and discomfort. This does not properly form the basis for an award for impairment of housekeeping capacity, but I have considered it as a factor in my award for non-pecuniary damages\n",

      "252  Significantly however, as of the date of trial, the plaintiff had not resumed the entirety of his pre-accident responsibilities; he has been unable to resume the heavier household tasks and gardening work he performed prior to the accident.

I have also considered the period to date of trial in which the plaintiff resumed some of his pre-accident household tasks but was unable to resume the more strenuous tasks. I conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to an award for his pre-trial loss of housekeeping capacity that will not be compensated for in his claim for special damages of $511.30. In quantifying his pre-trial loss, I have considered Ms. L.'s and Ms. Q.'s itemization of the estimate of replacement costs for gardening services, home maintenance, and janitorial services\n",

Doctrinally, I am of the view that compensation for these services properly should be addressed under loss of future housekeeping capacity. The underpinning for an award is a recognition of the impairment to homemaking capacity. In contrast to an award for future care, the issue of whether the plaintiff used any of these services in the past and the likelihood of whether or not the plaintiff would hire replacement help in the future does not inform the analysis: McTavish at para. 43\n",

The vehicles in the two oncoming lanes were stopped due to the congestion, but there was a gap between the oncoming cars which allowed her to enter the intersection for her turn. One or both of the drivers of the oncoming vehicles \"waved her through\". I infer that one or both of these drivers indicated they would wait in order to allow her to proceed through the intersection even though there was no traffic light requiring them to wait. Since the area was \"gridlocked\" or nearly so, I infer that there were probably vehicles in the lanes in front of them on the other side of intersection anyway\n",

She testified that she was more than halfway through the curb lane when her vehicle was struck. She had little warning of the impact, but thought the other vehicle was \"coming fast\".

Based on his evidence as a whole, these estimates of speed are not more than reconstructions, in my view. He testified that he saw the plaintiff's vehicle, and braked forcefully in order to avoid colliding with her vehicle. He testified that he also turned his vehicle somewhat to the left while attempting to avoid the collision.

He was headed to the Home Depot store. He testified that an elderly lady driving the vehicle at the head of the line of vehicles in the left lane \"waved us through\". He followed the plaintiff into the intersection. He testified that the plaintiff \"crept\" through the intersection without accelerating at any point. He noticed the defendant's vehicle \"at the last split second\". He testified that the defendant was driving \"very fast\". He was unable to estimate the defendant's speed with any precision.

      "21  An accident reconstruction engineer, Dr. Amrit Toor, testified on behalf of the plaintiff. He testified that, based upon the damage to the two vehicles, they collided at an angle that was nearly perpendicular. As noted, the plaintiff's Mini was struck in the rear quarter area just forward of the passenger side wheel. Dr. Toor noted precisely corresponding damage in the front bumper, passenger side, of the defendant's Acura. Using the photographs of the damage to the vehicles, he noted an arced shaped imprint in the right front bumper of the defendant's Acura which matched the curvature of the raised panel around the rear passenger side wheel of the plaintiff's Mini. (The photographs included in his report and the other vehicle damage photographs show an arced gash in this area quite clearly.) Based upon this evidence, and without reference to the opposing evidence of the parties, in his opinion the defendant was likely proceeding straight through the intersection when the accident occurred, rather than turning to the right\n",

      "III. ANALYSIS - LIABILIT\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "23  Based upon all of the evidence, I find that the defendant was proceeding straight through the intersection, and thus not turning right as he was required to do\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  The most reliable and precise evidence is provided by Dr. Toor. The only completely objective evidence available are the photographs of the damage to the vehicles. As Dr. Toor notes, due to the nature of the intersection, the arced path of the plaintiff's Mini through the intersection can be reasonably estimated. She left the dedicated left turn lane, where the path of her vehicle was constrained by the concrete curb or median on her left side and the concrete median in front of her. These barriers therefore confine the starting point of her path, as does the relatively narrow space on the right hand side of the entrance driveway to which she was proceeding. According to Dr. Toor, if the defendant was turning to the right, as he states, the angle of the collision would have been quite different, and inconsistent with the observed damage. I accept this opinion\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "25  The defendants argue that Dr. Toor's opinion that the vehicles collided at an angle of nearly 90 degrees has a margin of error, as he conceded, of perhaps 10 degrees. However this margin of error is relatively small. Dr. Toor denied that it affected his conclusions. I agree. The defendants were not able to impeach Dr. Toor's evidence, and offered no competing engineering opinion evidence. His evidence about the matching damage to the bumper of the defendant's Acura and the plaintiff's Mini is reliable. The \"T\" nature of the collision is very clear. In summary, I have no difficulty accepting the evidence of Dr. Toor, which strongly supports the plaintiff's theory and her evidence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  I would have rejected the evidence of the defendant even without the opinion of Dr. Toor. Under s. 165 of the Act, the driver of a vehicle who intends to turn right at an intersection must \"approach the intersection and then make the turn as close as practicable to the right hand curb or edge of the roadway.\" Quite apart from his statutory duty to do so, this would be the natural path for Mr. Asadi to take. Had he done so, it is difficult to conceive how the collision could have occurred at all in the circumstances, including his own evidence about slowing for the turn, the objective evidence of the accident scene, and the objective evidence as to the damage to the vehicles and the nature of the collision. In other words, Dr. Toor's opinion that the accident probably did not occur in the manner described by the defendant and did occur in the manner contended by the plaintiff is entirely consistent with the general circumstances, and accords with common sense inferences that I would make in any event\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  Dr. Toor discounted the significance of the evidence of Mr. Asadi that he swerved to the left. He considered the effect of this, if it occurred, as being within the margin of error that he allowed. I accept this. In any event, the evidence is imprecise and unreliable. However if indeed Mr. Asadi swerved to left to some extent, perhaps while braking, this action again supports an inference that he was driving straight through the intersection, rather than turning right. A swerve to the left or an attempt to do so on the part of the defendant makes sense if the impending collision was at or near a perpendicular angle, but not if the angle of impending collision is substantially less, as would have been the case had the two vehicles both been turning into the entrance at the same time just before they collided. In overall terms, I am unable to reconcile the defendant's version of events with the rest of the evidence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  Mr. Brooks was a colourful and overly opinionated witness. There are several reasons to treat his evidence with some caution. I nevertheless accept the overall thrust of his evidence. He had a good view of the accident. I accept his evidence that the defendant was travelling quickly, and that he appeared to be travelling straight through the intersection rather than turning to the right. He himself had to stop suddenly to avoid a collision. I accept his evidence that the plaintiff was proceeding slowly and cautiously through the intersection\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  Mr. Brooks acknowledged a criminal conviction for fraud, as well a breach of recognizance, and several driving infractions. He has had some kind of issues with ICBC in the past. He may have some degree of animus towards ICBC and hence the defendants. I do not consider his criminal record as being significant in relation to his credibility as an MVA witness. This concern and the possible animus does not add anything to the caution I adopt in any event\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  The defendant was an unpersuasive witness. He had a very poor memory of the relevant events. On examination in chief he was repeatedly led on the critical part of his evidence, concerning his intended route, thus substantially reducing the weight I can give to this evidence. He was somewhat evasive, and notably argumentative in cross-examination. Most importantly, his evidence is not consistent with reliable evidence, in particular the evidence of Dr. Toor. Finally, while of course I must be cautious about relying too much on demeanour alone, in testifying the defendant was remarkably casual and uninterested. He gave the impression that testifying in this case was an unwanted bother, as I suspect it indeed was for him. There was very little indication that he was sincerely attempting to be as truthful as possible, or taking the matter seriously. I put no weight on his evidence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  In my view, if the defendant had turned to the right as he was obliged to do, the collision would not have occurred, and even more so, had he kept a proper look out and had he been travelling at a reasonable, moderate speed relative to the applicable conditions, the accident would not have occurred. He was or ought to have been aware that the traffic congestion prevented him from seeing whether there was left turning vehicles in his path until just before the collision. In proceeding directly through the intersection in violation of his statutory duty, he took a risk that another vehicle could be crossing his path. He ought to have anticipated that another vehicle could be turning left into the shopping centre given the congested traffic and the time of day. The intersection was designed for that purpose, and he was familiar with the area, the shopping centre, and the intersection. Also based upon the traffic congestion he ought to have realized that a driver of a vehicle turning left into the shopping centre would not be able to see his vehicle until that driver had advanced beyond the stopped vehicles in the two travelling lanes, and that the driver would assume a vehicle in the curb lane would turn right, and would be travelling at a moderate speed commensurate with a right turn. He failed to drive with due caution. In my view, the actions of the defendant caused the accident, and were negligent\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "32  The plaintiff's theory that the defendant was proceeding straight through the intersection in order to turn right on Croydon Avenue is highly plausible. There was nothing other than the sign and arrow on the pavement preventing the defendant from doing so. The curb lane route was clear. The other lanes on 24th Avenue were congested and impassible. The defendant could avoid the congestion on 24th Avenue by taking either route\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "33  I accept the evidence of the plaintiff that she was driving slowly through the intersection. When she entered the intersection it was safe to do so, as the vehicles facing her were stopped specifically to allow her vehicle and others to move through the intersection while they waited for traffic in front of them to clear. The question remaining is whether the plaintiff ought to have anticipated or seen the defendant's vehicle proceeding quickly through the intersection illegally, or whether she failed to keep a proper lookout. I am not persuaded that she negligently failed to do so. I am not persuaded that in all of the circumstances she reasonably could have avoided the collision by taking greater care\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  The defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to keep a proper look out as she proceeded through the third or curb lane, and that she was negligent. During cross-examination she was asked a long question having to do with how far away the Asadi vehicle was when she entered the curb lane. She commented that, \"I have no idea. I wasn't paying attention.\" This comment was not pursued. She was not asked to clarify whether she was referring only to the question of the distance of the other vehicle when first seen, or more generally. In my view she meant the former. She confirmed her testimony on examination for discovery, where she had said that when she glanced to her right she saw \"a car coming fast at me\" and braced herself for the collision. If her comment that she was \"not paying attention\" is interpreted more broadly it is not consistent with her evidence as a whole and the other evidence, such as that of Mr. Brooks. I do not accept the plaintiff failed to keep a proper look out, in the circumstances. She was entitled to expect only right turning vehicles in the curb lane, proceeding at a speed commensurate with a right turn, only. She was not required to expect that the defendant would be proceeding directly through the intersection quickly\n",

But that care is more a matter of the ordinary duty of a reasonably careful driver and not a duty, in my view, imposed specifically by s. 176 [now s. 174] which in my view states the situation when the turn is commenced. Once the turn is commenced both of the drivers in that situation, the one who is doing a left turn and the ones that are approaching straight ahead in a situation where a vehicle could turn in front of them, all must keep a proper lookout\n",

The principle has been many times stated and was put many years ago by Lord Atkinson, giving the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Toronto Railway Company v. King et al  (at 269), in these terms:\n",

Should he, when out of the corner of his eye he saw a vehicle approaching the intersection coming towards him, have stood on his brake? Or was he entitled to assume, as a careful driver, that drivers will obey the traffic laws? Must we not all proceed on that assumption to at least a reasonable degree?\n",
      "Quite clearly, if he saw a vehicle actually entering the intersection, let us say at 70 miles an hour, if in those circumstances he then proceeded to make a turn, you would probably say that was a negligent thing to do. But seeing a vehicle approach the intersection when the light was either red for that vehicle or in the very last stage of amber, when he had no ability to form an estimate that that vehicle was approaching at such a speed that it wouldn't be able to stop, or alternatively, when there was nothing to indicate that here was a car about to run a red light or an amber light in its final stages, would that in your view amount to negligence?\n",

The defendant denies that he accepted responsibility at the scene. In itself, \"I am sorry\" is ambiguous. Even an offer to pay for damage may be made in order to simply avoid dealing with the insurer, particularly where the damage appears minor. Beyond these considerations, evidence as to what was said at the scene of an accident is typically unreliable for many reasons, including the shock and stress of the circumstances, and conscious or sub-conscious bias, and its inherently self-serving nature. As I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established the negligence of the defendant on the basis of reliable evidence, it is unnecessary that I make any findings about what may have been said by the defendant at the scene and whether this could have been an admission. It is also unnecessary for me to address the argument of the defendants that if Mr. Asadi apologized, the apology must not be taken into account in any determination of fault or liability in connection with the matter: s. 2(1)(a) and (d) of the Apology Act, S.B.C. 2006, c. 19.\n",

The appellant's principal complaint as a result of the accident is chronic disabling pain in the lumbar region of her back which she maintains she did not have before the accident. This disability is the second source or cause of damages. We now have the two sources or causes in respect of which the trial judge had to differentiate and compensate\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "82  The defendants cite the following paragraphs from Pryor:\n",
      "These two sources or causes of damages can be dealt with, either as a case of aggravated damages or as a \"thin skull\" case, depending on which of two factual circumstances are found to exist. In a case where a second source or cause of damages is found to aggravate an existing and active first source or cause, that is a case of aggravated damages and there may be an apportionment of damages as between the two sources or causes. On the other hand, in a case where a second source or cause of damages triggers the first source or cause which has been found immediately prior to the injury to be merely a latent weakness or susceptibility and not an active source or cause, that is a \"thin skull\" case and there can be no apportionment as between the two sources or causes and full damages must be awarded against the tortfeasor creating the second source or cause of damages which triggered the latent first source or cause. This distinction became the nub of this appeal.\n",
      "The second and more vexing argument of the appellant is that the trial judge erred in not applying the \"thin skull\" rule to the appellant's emotional reaction to the trauma or disturbing experience of the accident. The law is clear that the wrongdoer must take his victim as he finds him. I cite in support of this Marconato and Marconato v. Franklin,  at p. 690. There Aikins, J.A. relied on the celebrated passage in the decision of Kennedy, J. in Dulieu v. White & Sons, [1901] 2 K.B. 669 at 679, which passage propagated the line of so-called \"thin skull\" cases, and where he said:\n",
      "If a man is negligently run over or otherwise negligently injured in his body, it is no answer to the sufferer's claim for damages that he would have suffered less injury, or no injury at all, if he had not had an unusually thin skull or an unusually weak heart.\n",
      "I do not consider this to be a case for the application of the \"thin skull\" principle of assessing damages. The present case, where there was a pre-existing condition, as found by the trial judge, already manifest and presently disabling, must be distinguished from the \"thin skull\" cases where the weakness or latent susceptibility of the victim is quiescent but is activated into being as a result of the tortious conduct of another.\n",
      "I have not been persuaded that the trial judge misconstrued the evidence that the appellant was, at the time of the accident, using the pain of her neck injury as a psychological crutch and, following the accident, transferred the psychological crutch to the pain in the lumbar area of the back. This is a matter of fact. That being so, I must find that the trial judge correctly treated this as a case of aggravated damages rather than a \"thin skull\" case.\n",
      "I do not consider it error for the trial judge to weigh the continuing consequences of the pre-existing condition and the aggravated or added consequences of the accident and endeavour to do justice between the parties by a balanced apportionment of damages between the two.\n",

      "\n",
      "84  While Pryor refers to pre-existing conditions that are \"existing\" and \"active\" or \"already present and actively disabling\", these are not necessary findings in determining causation. Pre-existing conditions, whether quiescent or active, are part of the plaintiff's original position. Both latent and active pre-existing conditions must be considered in assessing the plaintiff's original position: T.W.N.A. v. Clarke,  [T.W.N.A.], at paras. 26-30; Moore v. Kyba, , at para. 43. For that reason the language used in Pryor can be misleading\n",

      "86  I think it necessary to quote from Athey at some length, for the sake of convenience:\n",
      "Multiple Tortious Causes\n",
      "22 The respondents argued that apportionment between tortious and non-tortious causes should be permitted just as it is where multiple tortfeasors cause the injury. The two situations are not analogous. Apportionment between tortious causes is expressly permitted by provincial negligence statutes and is consistent with the general principles of tort law. The plaintiff is still fully compensated and is placed in the position he or she would have been in but for the negligence of the defendants. Each defendant remains fully liable to the plaintiff for the injury, since each was a cause of the injury. The legislation simply permits defendants to seek contribution and indemnity from one another, according to the degree of responsibility for the injury.\n",
      "23 In the present case, the suggested apportionment is between tortious and non-tortious causes. Apportionment between tortious and non-tortious causes is contrary to the principles of tort law, because the defendant would escape full liability even though he or she caused or contributed to the plaintiff's entire injuries. The plaintiff would not be adequately compensated, since the plaintiff would not be placed in the position he or she would have been in absent the defendant's negligence.\n",
      "Divisible Injuries\n",
      "24 The respondents submitted that apportionment is permitted where the injuries caused by two defendants are divisible (for example, one injuring the plaintiff's foot and the other the plaintiff's arm): Fleming, supra, at p. 201. Separation of distinct and divisible injuries is not truly apportionment; it is simply making each defendant liable only for the injury he or she has caused, according to the usual rule. The respondents are correct that separation is also permitted where some of the injuries have tortious causes and some of the injuries have non-tortious causes: Fleming, supra, at p. 202. Again, such cases merely recognize that the defendant is not liable for injuries which were not caused by his or her negligence.\n",
      "25 In the present case, there is a single indivisible injury, the disc herniation, so division is neither possible nor appropriate. The disc herniation and its consequences are one injury, and any defendant found to have negligently caused or contributed to the injury will be fully liable for it.\n",
      "Adjustments for Contingencies\n",
      "26 The respondents argued that the trial judge's assessment of probabilities in causation was similar to the assessment of probabilities routinely undertaken by courts in adjusting damages to reflect contingencies. This argument overlooks the fundamental distinction between the way in which courts deal with alleged past events and the way in which courts deal with potential future or hypothetical events.\n",
      "27 Hypothetical events (such as how the plaintiff's life would have proceeded without the tortious injury) or future events need not be proven on a balance of probabilities. Instead, they are simply given weight according to their relative likelihood: Mallett v. McMonagle, [1970] A.C. 166 (H.L.); Malec v. J. C. Hutton Proprietary Ltd. (1990), 169 C.L.R. 638 (Aust. H.C.); Janiak v. Ippolito, . For example, if there is a 30 percent chance that the plaintiff's injuries will worsen, then the damage award may be increased by 30 percent of the anticipated extra damages to reflect that risk. A future or hypothetical possibility will be taken into consideration as long as it is a real and substantial possibility and not mere speculation: Schrump v. Koot  (C.A.); Graham v. Rourke  (Ont. C.A.).\n",
      "28 By contrast, past events must be proven, and once proven they are treated as certainties. In a negligence action, the court must declare whether the defendant was negligent, and that conclusion cannot be couched in terms of probabilities. Likewise, the negligent conduct either was or was not a cause of the injury. The court must decide, on the available evidence, whether the thing alleged has been proven; if it has, it is accepted as a certainty: Mallett v. McMonagle, supra; Malec v. J. C. Hutton Proprietary Ltd., supra, Cooper-Stephenson, supra, at pp. 67-81.\n",
      "29 This point was expressed by Lord Diplock in Mallett v. McMonagle, supra, at p. 176:\n",
      "The role of the court in making an assessment of damages which depends upon its view as to what will be and what would have been is to be contrasted with its ordinary function in civil actions of determining what was. In determining what did happen in the past a court decides on the balance of probabilities. Anything that is more probable than not it treats as certain. But in assessing damages which depend upon its view as to what will happen in the future or would have happened in the future if something had not happened in the past, the court must make an estimate as to what are the chances that a particular thing will or would have happened and reflect those chances, whether they are more or less than even, in the amount of damages which it awards.\n",
      "30 In this case, the disc herniation occurred prior to trial. It was a past event, which cannot be addressed in terms of probabilities. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the injuries sustained in the accidents caused or contributed to the disc herniation. Once the burden of proof is met, causation must be accepted as a certainty.\n",
      "Independent Intervening Events\n",
      "31 The respondents also sought to draw an analogy with cases where an unrelated event, such as a disease or non-tortious accident, occurs after the plaintiff is injured. One such case was Jobling v. Associated Dairies Ltd., [1981] 2 All E.R. 752 (H.L.), in which the defendant negligently caused the plaintiff to suffer a back injury. Before the trial took place, it was discovered that the plaintiff had a condition, completely unrelated to the accident, which would have proved totally disabling in a few years. Damages were reduced accordingly. In Penner v. Mitchell  (Alta. C.A.), damages for loss of income for 13 months were reduced because the plaintiff had a heart condition, unrelated to the accident, which would have caused her to miss three months of work in any event.\n",
      "32 To understand these cases, and to see why they are not applicable to the present situation, one need only consider first principles. The essential purpose and most basic principle of tort law is that the plaintiff must be placed in the position he or she would have been in absent the defendant's negligence (the \"original position\"). However, the plaintiff is not to be placed in a position better than his or her original one. It is therefore necessary not only to determine the plaintiff's position after the tort but also to assess what the \"original position\" would have been. It is the difference between these positions, the \"original position\" and the \"injured position\", which is the plaintiff's loss. In the cases referred to above, the intervening event was unrelated to the tort and therefore affected the plaintiff's \"original position\". The net loss was therefore not as great as it might have otherwise seemed, so damages were reduced to reflect this.\n",
      "33 In the present case, there was a finding of fact that the accident caused or contributed to the disc herniation. The disc herniation was not an independent intervening event. The disc herniation was a product of the accidents, so it does not affect the assessment of the plaintiff's \"original position\" and thereby reduce the net loss experienced by the plaintiff.\n",
      "The Thin Skull and \"Crumbling Skull\" Doctrines\n",
      "34 The respondents argued that the plaintiff was predisposed to disc herniation and that this is therefore a case where the \"crumbling skull\" rule applies. The \"crumbling skull\" doctrine is an awkward label for a fairly simple idea. It is named after the well-known \"thin skull\" rule, which makes the tortfeasor liable for the plaintiff's injuries even if the injuries are unexpectedly severe owing to a pre-existing condition. The tortfeasor must take his or her victim as the tortfeasor finds the victim, and is therefore liable even though the plaintiff's losses are more dramatic than they would be for the average person.\n",
      "35 The so-called \"crumbling skull\" rule simply recognizes that the pre-existing condition was inherent in the plaintiff's \"original position\". The defendant need not put the plaintiff in a position better than his or her original position. The defendant is liable for the injuries caused, even if they are extreme, but need not compensate the plaintiff for any debilitating effects of the pre-existing condition which the plaintiff would have experienced anyway. The defendant is liable for the additional damage but not the pre-existing damage: Cooper-Stephenson, supra, at pp. 779-780 and John Munkman, Damages for Personal Injuries and Death (9th ed. 1993), at pp. 39-40. Likewise, if there is a measurable risk that the pre-existing condition would have detrimentally affected the plaintiff in the future, regardless of the defendant's negligence, then this can be taken into account in reducing the overall award: Graham v. Rourke, ; Malec v. J. C. Hutton Proprietary Ltd., 169 C.L.R. 638; Cooper-Stephenson, supra, at pp. 851-852. This is consistent with the general rule that the plaintiff must be returned to the position he would have been in, with all of its attendant risks and shortcomings, and not a better position.\n",
      "36 The \"crumbling skull\" argument is the respondents' strongest submission, but in my view it does not succeed on the facts as found by the trial judge. There was no finding of any measurable risk that the disc herniation would have occurred without the accident, and there was therefore no basis to reduce the award to take into account any such risk\n",

      "What was the plaintiff's state of health and function pre-accident? Was she healthy, fit and active as she says, or should her evidence about that be rejected? This question must factor into what, in the words of Athey, is my assessment of her \"original position\"; that is, the position she would have been today absent the injuries suffered in the accident, and which must be compared with her \"injured position\"; that is, the position she is now in due to the accident injuries. In the circumstances of this case, this is primarily a question of past fact, to be determined on a balance of probabilities. (Athey, paras. 32);\n",
      "Are the plaintiff's injuries in whole or in part caused by unrelated intervening events? (Athey, paras. 31-33);\n",
      "Was there a \"measurable risk\" that the plaintiff's pre-existing condition would have detrimentally affected her in the future, regardless of the defendant's negligence, and which should therefore be taken into account in assessing her loss?

Her own evidence to that effect was persuasively corroborated by several witnesses. Her mother Sandi Collins, her daughter Stephanie, and her brother Matthew Firman all testified to this effect. These witnesses could be expected to be biased and so their evidence must be considered with some caution, but notwithstanding this concern I have no difficulty accepting their evidence about this\n",

She participated in triathlons, she bicycled regularly, including 15 or 20 km to work, each way. She ran. Pre-accident, she was stoical and attended doctors infrequently. She was optimistic by nature and had a positive outlook. Post-accident, she has lost the use of her (dominant) left arm and has had to learn to cut hair with her right hand.

She provided no proof of competing in any Ironman competitions, when I would expect that such proof could be easily obtained. However, she has proven that she completed the triathlon in Tempe Arizona in April 2012 (One year pre-accident), and a half marathon in Victoria on October 7, 2012, about seven months pre-accident\n",

He testified that pre-accident she was bubbly, vivacious, social, and a happy person. \"Fitness was her whole life\", he said. He participated in her fitness boot camps, usually conducted outdoors, such as a park or beach. She demonstrated, and participated. She was able to do eight or ten haircuts in a day.

He became aware of the MVA two or three days after it happened, when she told him about it. He testified that now she is quite a different person. She is depressed. She is no longer lively, and joking, as before. She stopped training, so he no longer participates in that. Haircuts take longer. She no longer washes his hair.

There is no doubt that functionally she was very active, and unrestricted. This does not mean that she was in perfect health. She acknowledged migraine headaches and other minor ailments which she associated with training. She had degenerative changes in her neck that had resulted in symptoms on her right side. I find that these were transient, and not active and debilitating at the time of the MVA, however\n",

She did not see a doctor about the accident injuries until she saw a Dr. Verbonac on September 17, 2013, some 4.5 months post-accident. None of the doctors who testified thought that this fact was particularly significant to the causation issue, in the circumstances of this case. For example, in cross-examination, Dr. Gilbart was asked whether the fact that she did not seek medical attention for four-and-a-half months would be of interest to him. He said \"potentially\". This was not pursued any further\n",

I thought I would just get better. I was always a tough person who would just work things out.\" She had to be persuaded to see a doctor by Randy MacDonald. He testified that immediately after the accident, she had pain in left shoulder and left hip, and she was rubbing her shoulder all the time. He told her to see a doctor. Her condition worsened over the weeks and months post MVA. He said, \"Basically I forced her to see a doctor eventually.\" Her stoic nature is supported by the evidence of her brother Matthew Firman. He testified that after the accident she was \"sore\". She limped when she walked, and said she was in a lot of pain. He suggested she go to the doctor. Her treating psychologist, Dr. Schweighofer, who would have a good insight into her personality, characterized her behaviour as an effort to \"soldier through\"\n",

The defendants say that this fact was disguised by the plaintiff's retrospectively attributing to the accident immediate pain and disability. Her insistence that it was a condition that had escalated immediately and severely after the accident led her treating physicians to assume a simple, but the defendants say misleading, cause to her conditions which were slowly evolving most likely due to her devotion to extreme sporting activities aggravating her pre-existing symptomatic degenerative disc disease/osteoarthritis condition\n",

      "122  The defendants argue that that she failed to report to the treatment providers and experts that she was having trouble with breast implants and that she required treatment in that regard. She had breast augmentation surgery many years before the MVA and was having some trouble with the implants. She underwent implant replacement surgery on July 23, 2013. She was not happy with the results. The defendants rely on a note to her breast surgeon's office dated October 28, 2013, in which the plaintiff stated, \"I am very unhappy with the results, I am crying all the time.\" The note was admitted into evidence near the conclusion of the trial by agreement of counsel, but was not put to the plaintiff in her testimony, thus reducing the weight I give it. Further implant replacement surgery was done on July 17, 2014. As a minimum, she reported and discussed her breast implant problems with her G.P., Dr. Iso, who was aware of the surgeries. There is no evidence that the plaintiff continues to suffer from any problem in this regard. The plaintiff testified that the breast implant problems and surgery did not affect her accident injuries. There is no evidence to the contrary. There is no evidence that the breast implant issues are relevant to her accident injuries. Therefore whether the plaintiff did or did not report breast implant problems to her treatment providers or IME experts is of no consequence. However, and in any event, I do not find that the plaintiff withheld relevant information from the experts in relation to this.\n",

On one occasion the plaintiff fell when running at a baseball diamond during a baseball practice for her daughter. They refer to other minor mishaps as well, such as a fall down stairs noted in the clinical record of Dr. Iso on May 17, 2017. The evidence does not support a finding that these events are more than minor mishaps that are not material in relation to causation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "125  The defendants contend that the plaintiff's psychiatric or psychological problems are due to factors other than the motor vehicle accident. They argue that her psychological condition is caused by unrelated independent events. These include: (1) a home invasion (a grow-rip) of Mr. MacDonald's grow-operation that occurred in October, 2012 (thus, several months before the MVA); (2) her father's death in 2017 (3) a heart attack suffered by her mother post accident (4) psychological problems suffered by her daughter, and (5) the ending of her relationship with Mr. MacDonald in December, 2015, and associated financial distress. These are arguments for \"independent intervening events\", in the language of Athey, (although the home invasion pre-dated the MVA)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "126  It is convenient once again to refer in this context to Athey. In Athey, the main issue was whether there should be an apportionment of the damages where the defendant contends that there were non-tortious causes that combined with the defendant's tortious conduct to cause the plaintiff's indivisible loss. Following the motor vehicle accidents the plaintiff suffered a disc herniation which led to surgery. His back injury did not fully recover. The defendants argued that the loss was in part caused by the plaintiff's pre-existing back problems. The Supreme Court of Canada rejected the argument that the loss could be apportioned. Major J. stated:\n",
      "12 The respondents' position is that where a loss is created by tortious and non-tortious causes, it is possible to apportion the loss according to the degree of causation. This is contrary to well-established principles. It has long been established that a defendant is liable for any injuries caused or contributed to by his or her negligence. If the defendant's conduct is found to be a cause of the injury, the presence of other non-tortious contributing causes does not reduce the extent of the defendant's liability.\n",
      "...\n",
      "17 It is not now necessary, nor has it ever been, for the plaintiff to establish that the defendant's negligence was the sole cause of the injury. There will frequently be a myriad of other background events which were necessary preconditions to the injury occurring...As long as a defendant is part of the cause of an injury, the defendant is liable, even though his act alone was not enough to create the injury. There is no basis for a reduction of liability because of the existence of other preconditions: defendants remain liable for all injuries caused or contributed to by their negligence.\n",
      "20 ...If the law permitted apportionment between tortious causes and non-tortious causes, a plaintiff could recover 100 percent of his or her loss only when the defendant's negligence was the sole cause of the injuries. Since most events are the result of a complex set of causes, there will frequently be non-tortious causes contributing to the injury. Defendants could frequently and easily identify non-tortious contributing causes, so plaintiffs would rarely receive full compensation even after proving that the defendant caused the injury. This would be contrary to established principles and the essential purpose of tort law, which is to restore the plaintiff to the position he or she would have enjoyed but for the negligence of the defendant.\n",

      "128  As noted previously, Dr. Waraich, IME psychiatrist, diagnosed: (1) Persistent depressive disorder with persistent major depressive episode, moderate to severe, with anxious distress; and (2) Somatic symptom disorder with predominant pain. The defendants do not challenge the diagnosis\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "129  Dr. Waraich considered the pre-accident and post accident clinical records and reports in detail. He specifically considered the question of whether \"post-accident independent stressors\" such as those referred to by the defendants and others caused her mental health problems. In his view other factors were significant contributors, but were not the \"predominant factors in her post injury mental health presentation\". He observed that some stressors could be considered fully independent of the MVA (the death of her father, for example) but others were inter-related, such as her relationship break-up, and her daughter's mental health issues\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "130  I accept this opinion. Translating the opinion of Dr. Waraich into legal terminology, while there may have been other non-tortious causative factors, the predominant cause of her mental health problems is the MVA injuries. \"But for\" causation is clearly established\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "131  I also agree with Dr. Waraich that some of the stressors are inter-related to her MVA injuries. On the evidence of the plaintiff and Mr. MacDonald, it is reasonable to conclude that the plaintiff's accident injuries played a significant role in the break-up. Had the plaintiff been emotionally resilient, as by all accounts she was prior to the accident, it is reasonable to infer that she would have been better equipped to deal with the break-up and with her daughter's problems. Another source of the plaintiff's mood problems has been the effects of the MVA injuries on her training and work, and also consequential financial pressures. In short, the other events that the defendants identify are not all completely independent\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "132  The home invasion was pre-accident. It is an unrelated but not an intervening event. In any event, there is no basis to find that it alone or in combination with other non-accident related issues would have caused her mental health problems, absent the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "133  The opinions of Dr. Iso and Dr. Schweighofer are consistent with those of Dr. Waraich concerning causation. Dr. Iso, her G.P., was a very fair witness in all respects. He recites the history of her condition thoroughly in his report. He says, \"her personal life contributed to a large degree to her psychological state\". He also states:\n",
      "Furthermore, Ms. Firman developed PTSD symptoms, depression and anxiety since the accident. ...\n",
      "Her psychological symptoms are exacerbated by personal struggles with her daughter and other personal reasons. She has also shown frustration over her injuries suffered in the accident and her significantly decreased functioning since\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "134  At trial, in cross-examination, he testified that he had many discussions with his patient. He testified that her main stressor was her loss of income and ability to work; then, later, other issues such as the break-up, her father's death, and problems involving her daughter\n",

      "135  Her treating psychologist Dr. Schweighofer has seen her many times (approximately 32 occasions as of June 18, 2018). He diagnosed PTSD, Somatic Symptom Disorder with Predominant Pain, clinical depression, and anxiety. (In his reports he tended to qualify these diagnoses with phrases such as \"symptoms of\". However in his evidence at trial he confirmed that he made the diagnoses set out in his report.) He was careful to emphasize that he was a treatment provider, not an independent forensic expert, and so was not addressing causation issues in his reports and opinions. However taken in totality his opinion as to the ancillary and exacerbating role of other stressors in her life is very consistent with those of Drs. Waraich and Iso. In his June 18, 2018 report he states:\n",
      "Unfortunately, Ms. Firman has remained emotionally fragile during my treatment of her. Despite her ongoing efforts to apply CBT skills and strategies, her ongoing pain has severely limited her ability to work and to earn a wage and these issues have represented significant stressors that have contributed to ongoing low mood. Other stressors have included the death of her father and her mother experienced a heart attack. Her daughter has also faced struggles. Ms. Firman was already very emotionally vulnerable and these additional stressors further exacerbated her distress\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "136  In summary, the MVA is the predominant cause of her psychological problems. This finding is more than sufficient to conclude that from a legal perspective, causation of loss in relation to her psychological condition is attributable to the negligence of the defendant\n",

      "\n",
      "137  If unrelated intervening events would have affected the plaintiff's original position adversely in any event, the net loss attributable to the tort will not be as great and damages will be reduced proportionately: T.W.N.A. at para. 36. T.W.N.A. states that unrelated intervening events must be taken into account in the same way as pre-existing conditions, in that if the intervening event would have affected the plaintiff's original position adversely in any event, the net loss attributable to the tort will not be as great and damages will be reduced proportionately. More recently, in Khudabux v. McClary , the Court of Appeal has said that the issue of intervening events is more properly approached through the lens of causation (at para. 37). Whether the issue is classified as an issue of causation or assessment of damages does not matter. The analysis is the same: if unrelated events would have affected the plaintiff's condition in any event, then the defendant has not caused the loss attributable to the unrelated events, and an apportionment of the plaintiff's damages should be made\n",

Her daughter said that she was very positive mentally, and could handle stress. Michael Morice said she was a happy go-getter. She had been divorced previously, (to Kirk Patterson) and had apparently remained mentally healthy after that. The evidence as a whole shows that pre-accident she had no mood or psychological problems. There is no suggestion on the medical evidence that the plaintiff might have had psychological problems absent the accident. In summary, on the medical and other evidence, I am not satisfied that, absent the accident, there was a realistic possibility or measurable risk that the other events the defendants refer to would have caused the plaintiff's psychological condition in any event.\n",

      "Given the absence of any reported symptoms affecting the lumbosacral, thoracic and cervical spinal areas, the left hip or the left shoulder girdle and upper extremity prior to the motor vehicle accident of April 27, 2013, it is probable that the presenting pain syndrome that Ms. Firman is presently experiencing is directly attributable to injuries sustained secondary to the torsional acceleration/deceleration forces of the motor vehicle accident of April 27, 2013. The clinical syndrome recognized in the literature as referable to the injuries sustained in the lumbosacral, thoracic and cervical spine is known as whiplash-associated disorder.\n",

The degree of impairment is congruent with the clinical presentation and my diagnoses.

      "A. Loss of Earning Capacity\n",
      "1. Legal Principle\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "155  I adopt my comments regarding the basic legal principles relevant to the assessment of past loss of earning capacity set out in Sendher v. Wong,  (CanLII) [Sendher]:\n",
      "[158] The award for past loss of earning capacity is based on the value of the work that the plaintiff would have performed but for her accident injuries. The award is properly characterized as a loss of earning capacity: Bradley v. Bath,  (CanLII) at paras. 31-32; Lines v. W & D Logging Co. Ltd.,  (CanLII), at para. 153; X. v. Y.,  (CanLII), at para. 185.\n",
      "[159] The plaintiff need not establish the actual loss of earnings on a balance of probabilities. What would have happened prior to the trial but for the accident injuries is hypothetical, just the same as what may happen in the future, after the trial.\n",
      "[160] In Smith v. Knudsen,  (CanLII), at para. 29, Rowles J.A. stated:\n",
      "What would have happened in the past but for the injury is no more \"knowable\" than what will happen in the future and therefore it is appropriate to assess the likelihood of hypothetical and future events rather than applying the balance of probabilities test that is applied with respect to past actual events.\n",
      "[161] However the plaintiff must establish on a balance of probabilities that there is a causal connection between the accident injuries and the pecuniary loss claimed; mere speculation is insufficient: Smith v. Knudsen para. 36; Athey, at para. 27; Perren v. Lalari,  (CanLII), at para. 32; Falati v. Smith,  (CanLII), at para. 41, aff'd  (CanLII).\n",
      "[162] Just as in the case of the assessment of future loss of earning capacity, in the case of past loss of earning capacity, if the plaintiff establishes a real and substantial likelihood of the pecuniary loss asserted, the assessment of damages to be awarded as compensation depends upon an assessment of the degree of likelihood of the particular loss, combined with an assessment of the value of the loss.\n",
      "[163] In cases where it is appropriate to proceed with an assessment of the value of the loss, s. 98 of the Insurance (Vehicle) Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 231, stipulates that a person who suffers loss of income is only entitled to recover the net income amount as damages: X. v. Y., at para. 187; Lines, at paras. 152-186.\n",
      "...\n",
      "[171] The Court's essential task is to compare the likely future of the plaintiff's working life if the accident had not happened with the plaintiff's likely future working life after the accident: Gregory, at para. 32. Insofar as possible, the plaintiff should be put in the position he or she would have been in but for the injuries caused by the defendant's negligence: Lines, at para. 185.\n",
      "[172] The appropriate means of assessment will vary from case to case: Brown v. Golaiy (1985),  (BC SC), ; Pallos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia (1995),  (BC CA), ; Pett v. Pett,  (CanLII).\n",
      "[173] The assessment of damages is a matter of judgment, not calculation: Rosvold v. Dunlop,  (CanLII), at para. 18.\n",
      "[174] There are two possible approaches to assessment of loss of future earning capacity: the \"earnings approach\" from Pallos and the \"capital asset approach\" in Brown. Both approaches are correct and will be more or less appropriate depending on whether the loss in question can be quantified in a measurable way: Perren v. Lalari,  (CanLII), at para. 12.\n",
      "[175] The earnings approach involves a form of math-oriented methodology such as: (i) postulating a minimum annual income loss for the plaintiff's remaining years of work, multiplying the annual projected loss by the number of remaining years and calculating a present value; or (ii) awarding the plaintiff's entire annual income for a year or two: Pallos; Gilbert,  at para. 233.\n",
      "[176] The capital asset approach involves considering factors such as whether the plaintiff (i) has been rendered less capable overall of earning income from all types of employment; (ii) is less marketable or attractive as a potential employee; (iii) has lost the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities that might otherwise have been open; and (iv) is less valuable to herself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour market: Brown; Gilbert, at para. 233.\n",
      "[177] The principles that apply in assessing loss of future earning capacity were summarized by Low J.A. in Reilly v. Lynn,  (CanLII), at para. 101:\n",
      "[101] The relevant principles may be briefly summarized. The standard of proof in relation to future events is simple probability, not the balance of probabilities, and hypothetical events are to be given weight according to their relative likelihood: Athey v. Leonati,  (SCC),  at para. 27. A plaintiff is entitled to compensation for real and substantial possibilities of loss, which are to be quantified by estimating the chance of the loss occurring: Athey v. Leonati, supra, at para. 27, Steenblok v. Funk  at 135 (C.A.). The valuation of the loss of earning capacity may involve a comparison of what the plaintiff would probably have earned but for the accident with what he will probably earn in his injured condition: Milina v. Bartsch (1985),  (BC SC),  at 93 (S.C.). However, that is not the end of the inquiry; the overall fairness and reasonableness of the award must be considered: Rosvold v. Dunlop,  (CanLII) at para. 11; Ryder v. Paquette,  (C.A.) (Q.L.). Moreover, the task of the Court is to assess the losses, not to calculate them mathematically: Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate (1995),  (BC CA),  (C.A.). Finally, since the course of future events is unknown, allowance must be made for the contingency that the assumptions upon which the award is based may prove to be wrong: Milina v. Bartsch, supra, at 79. ..\n",

      "55 As I will explain, in this case the capital asset approach is applicable. The following comments of Savage J.A. in Villing v. Husseni,  are relevant:\n",
      "18 Using the capital asset approach does not mean the assessment is unstructured. I agree with Garson J.A.'s observations in Morgan v. Galbraith, :\n",
      "[56] If the assessment is still to be based on the capital asset approach the judge must consider the four questions in Brown in the context of the facts of this case and make findings of fact as to the nature and extent of the plaintiff's loss of capacity and how that loss may impact the plaintiff's ability to earn income. Adopting the capital asset approach does not mean that the assessment is entirely at large without the necessity to explain the factual basis of the award: Morris v. Rose Estate  at para. 24, ; Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate  at para. 43, .\n",
      "[Emphasis added.]\n",
      "19 In every case where the capital asset approach is adopted, the four questions in Brown v. Golaiy  at para. 8 (S.C.), form the basis of the assessment. The questions are whether:\n",
      "The plaintiff has been rendered less capable overall from earning income from all types of employment;\n",

The plaintiff put the cash revenue \"into my pocket\". The plaintiff testified that this day was exceptional and that she ordinarily does not have sufficient stamina for this much work.

      "In theory a claim for the cost of future care is a pecuniary claim for the amount which may reasonably be expected to be expended in putting the injured party in a position where he would have been in had he not sustained the injury. Obviously a plaintiff who has been gravely and permanently impaired can never be put in the position he would have been in if the tort had not been committed. To this extent, \"restitutio in integrum\" is not possible. Money is a barren substitute for health and personal happiness but to the extent, within reason, that money can be used to sustain or improve the mental or physical health of the injured person it may properly form part of the claim.\n",
      "69 An award for cost of future care is based on what is reasonably necessary, on medical evidence, to promote the mental and physical health of the claimant: Milina v. Bartsch  (S.C.) at 78, aff'd  (C.A.); Aberdeen v. Zanatta,  at para. 41; Gignac v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia,  at para. 30. An award for future care must (1) have medical justification, and (2) be reasonable: Milina at 84; Aberdeen at para. 42.\n",
      "70 In Gregory v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, , this Court clarified that the medical necessity of future care costs may be established by a health care professional other than a physician, such as an occupational therapist, if there is a link between a physician's assessment of pain, disability, and recommended treatment, and the health care professional's recommended care item (at para. 39)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "239  It is necessary to consider the likelihood that an expense will be incurred in future: Gilbert v. Bottle,  at para. 251. No award should be made in relation to an expense that the plaintiff will not actually incur: Izony v. Weidlich,  at para. 74\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "240  As Mr. Justice Schultes stated in Warick v. Diwell, , aff'd , at para. 207:\n",
      "[207] Damages for the cost of future care are assessed, not mathematically calculated: Uhrovic v. Masjhuri,  at paras. 28-31. There is an inherent degree of uncertainty and discretion in making such awards. Because awards are made \"once and for all\" at the time of trial, judges must \"peer into the future\" and fix the damages \"as best they can\". This includes allowing contingencies for the possibility that the future may differ from what the evidence at trial indicates: Krangle (Guardian ad litem of) v. Brisco, , at para. 21\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "241  The plaintiff relies on the expert evidence of Mair Edwards, Occupational Therapist. Ms. Edwards conducted an occupational therapy assessment of the plaintiff in the plaintiff's home on July 8, 2018. The recommendations made by Ms. Edwards have been translated into dollar amounts by Mr. Turnbull, who prepared a table of the costs, a copy of which is appended as Schedule A to these reasons\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "242  As is common, the recommendations set out in the OT's cost of care report are founded on an expansive definition of the plaintiff's needs. Ms. Edwards states that:\n",
      "The objective of such an analysis is to identify those items and services which may be required to maintain his or her health, normalize his or her independence and safety, and replicate as closely as possible the lifestyle he or she would have experienced had the injury or illness not occurred\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "243  There is nothing necessarily wrong with this, but as the standard applied is not the same as the legal standard (reasonably necessary, on medical evidence, to promote the mental and physical health of the claimant, etc.), the recommendations must be critically examined\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "244  The defendants argue that no award is justified, or alternatively based on the finding that the plaintiff's TOS is caused by the accident and that the pending minor surgery will require some future care items, $14,316, for (1) $1,316 for rehabilitation services (physiotherapy, and other treatment) (2) $10,000 for household services, and (3) $3,000 for Botox treatments. Surprisingly, given the minimal amounts that the defence submits are justified, in cross-examination, Ms. Edwards was not seriously challenged on her recommendations\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "245  I will review the claim by reference to the categories set out on Mr. Turnbull's table.\n",
      "1. Medical Professional Services and Support Service\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "246  The total of this category is $63,449\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "247  I agree that some reasonable amount of such services is reasonably necessary and medically justified, but the claim as presented is far too high. The physiotherapy recommendation is 24 sessions annually for 2 years, then 12 sessions annually for life. In addition to this, Ms. Edwards recommends 12 chiropractic sessions annually to age 65. She will require some continued physiotherapy or chiropractic treatment in future. These treatments overlap. Similarly, the recommendations for occupational therapy, counselling, and vocational counselling are all in amounts that are well beyond what is reasonably necessary. She had previously used chiropractic treatments and other therapies and could have been expected to utilize them in future, absent the accident. Most people incur some level of expense for exercise and fitness. The plaintiff herself provided and continues to provide such services, for remuneration. The strongest claim is for counselling, based upon the recommendations of Drs. Schweighofer, Waraich, and MacInnes. Some vocational counselling, coaching or assistance is justified, based upon the likelihood that she will change careers, but this would be limited, given the narrow range of job options and the entry-level nature of the positions she could do\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "248  In my view a reasonable award in relation to these items is $30,000.\n",
      "2. Household Service\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "249  The amount of the claim in this category is $87,238. The medical evidence supports the need for assistance with heavier housework and outdoor work (Dr. MacInnes). Ms. Edwards includes recommendations for outdoor assistance, in case in future she has a need for exterior services. This is unlikely, however. She currently lives in a two bedroom apartment with her high school age daughter, who may be expected to become independent. Given her expected income, she is unlikely to reside in a single family residence in future. She is able to do most ordinary interior cleaning and maintenance tasks. Her condition may improve\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "250  It is reasonable to allow for some annual or semi-annual deep cleaning or maintenance costs. I accept the submission of the defendants that $10,000 is reasonable.\n",
      "3. Pain Managemen\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "251  The claim in this category is $192,341. The largest single item, by far, is for Botox treatment, at $134,589, at $5,000 per year, for life\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "252  Ms. Edwards does not identify the medical basis for her recommendation for TENS and hot and cold wraps. I would expect that if these therapies are effective, her need for pain medications would be reduced accordingly\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "253  She has benefitted from Botox and other injections provided by Dr. Dhawan in the past. However the medical evidence does not support the need for this treatment at current levels, for life, as claimed. No doctor has stated that this treatment would be reasonable, for decades. Dr. Dhawan states that she will \"continue to require\" such treatments in future. Dr. MacInnes recommends that she continue the injections, \"as long as she continues to benefit from them.\" Dr. Kendall was sceptical regarding long term Botox usage. It is, obviously, a very costly form of treatment, that has only transient benefits, in that it must be repeated every three months. The plaintiff has not satisfied me that the amount of this expense is reasonable and necessary long term. In my view $15,000 is a reasonable allowance, as this would allow the treatment to continue for a further three years\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "254  The claims for other medications are more reasonable. Topomax is for headache, and Cipralex is an anti-depressant. I have not been able to identify the medical source of the recommendation for Robaxacet. Ms. Edwards noted that the plaintiff uses it, as needed. This is insufficient to establish a lifetime need and a large expense\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "255  I allow the claim at $60,000, which allows for Botox for three years, and ample amounts for the other medications.\n",
      "4. Positional Aid\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "256  The plaintiff claims $24,766 in this category. These items are largely based upon Ms. Edwards' own recommendations, based upon the plaintiff's neck, shoulder, hip and back pains. The largest claim is for an orthotics assessment, and orthotics (combined: $7,814). I am not satisfied that a medical justification has been established for this. Ms. Edwards does not identify one. Dr. Waraich recommends exercise, and appropriate sleep hygiene. He suggests at wearable fitness tracker. The plaintiff is a keen exerciser and did not mention the need for a monitoring device. She did not mention the need for or possible utility of any of the items in this category. Almost any modern car the plaintiff might acquire will be equipped with a back up camera. Given her condition, I can see the need for some comfort aids and devices, long term, such as pillows, reaching aids, or household devices of some kind. A modest award is reasonable. I award $5,000 for the claims in this category\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "257  In summary, the damages award for costs of future care is $105,000.\n",
      "E. Special Damage\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "261  As noted, in this case I did not hear the evidence of the plaintiff until well into the trial. This has been the subject of repeated adverse judicial comment in the past: Gustafson v Davis, , at paras. 112-116; Chenier v. Szili, \n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "262  This was especially problematic in this case, where the case for the defence centered on the plaintiff's pre-accident condition, and her credibility, and there was a plethora of expert witnesses. I heard numerous witnesses cross-examined at length about what the plaintiff did or did not say about her pre-accident condition, and about the information she provided about her condition and its consequence, without having heard the evidence of the plaintiff herself about these matters. I was deprived of the opportunity to consider the evidence of the experts who testified prior to the plaintiff within the proper context. The defence was unable to put the actual evidence of the plaintiff to the experts in cross-examination. Instead, I heard much cross-examination that was essentially hypothetical in nature. Such testimony may turn out to be irrelevant, or inconsistent with the actual evidence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "263  Although scheduling other witnesses such as experts in priority to the evidence of the plaintiff may be convenient, that is an inadequate reason to depart from the usual and best practice: Chenier, at para. 89\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "264  The problems were made even more acute due to the fact that there was no Document Agreement, and no agreement between counsel as to the use or admissibility of documents, such as the plaintiff's pre and post accident clinical records. I heard abundant cross-examination of the plaintiff and other witnesses regarding matters that were said to be in clinical records, without any prior agreement between the parties as to the use to which the clinical records could be put. I was called upon to make a ruling at the end of the trial (indexed at )\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "265  Given that the legal principles governing the use of clinical records at trial are reasonably well-settled, in my view the parties to a personal injury case ought to be able to resolve document issues and to present the court with a comprehensive Document Agreement, in every case, at the outset of the trial. Any anticipated issues should be clearly identified at that time. Counsel should have a plan for resolving the issues in a timely manner through oral argument and if necessary, voir dire\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "266  In the result, the trial was complicated unnecessarily, and the time and effort required to deliberate and to prepare reasons was substantially increased\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "267  Where the plaintiff is not called first, there may be an effect on the weight to which his or her evidence may be given. In addition, in my view, given the inefficiency which may result, this matter could potentially be addressed in costs. In a future case, I may decide to do so\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "268  I also suggest that the matter of witness order and scheduling should be addressed at the trial management conference. As in this case, it cannot be addressed at the outset of the trial, as by then re-scheduling witnesses may not be possible\n",

      "269  In any personal injury case, the parties should also be able to prepare an Agreed Statement of Facts, which ought to be as comprehensive as possible. An Agreed Chronology of Facts should be at the core of the Agreed Statement of Facts. Personal injury trials frequently take place several years after the accident. It is painful to listen to witnesses give confused and confusing testimony regarding, for example, non-contentious chronological matters, when there is no need for this. The dates of significant treatment and work events and milestones should be the subject of an Agreed Chronology, except of course if there is some real issue\n",

      "1   The plaintiff Ceara Brienn LeBlanc brings this action as a result of the death of Kelly Joseph LeBlanc, her husband and the father of her children, on her own behalf and on behalf of her children pursuant to the Family Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 126. The plaintiff claims the defendants Dr. Craven, the Vancouver Island Health Authority (\"VIHA\"), and others were negligent by failing to diagnose and treat Mr. LeBlanc properly\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "2  On June 21, 2010, Mr. LeBlanc was treated by the defendant Dr. Charles Craven, a general practitioner working in the Emergency Department of the West Coast General Hospital in Port Alberni. On July 8, 2010, Mr. LeBlanc died from complications related to an invasive streptococcal infection\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "3  Dr. Craven applies by way of summary trial for a dismissal of the action against him, plus costs. He says that in order to prove the allegation that he was negligent the plaintiff must provide evidence to the court, in the form of expert opinion, regarding the standard of care applicable to an emergency room physician working at a rural British Columbia hospital in 2010. He argues that the plaintiff has served only the expert reports of Dr. Mazzulli and that these reports are inadmissible. He submits that it is therefore impossible for the plaintiff to prove the claim of negligence against him and that he should be dismissed from the action\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "4  The defendant Dr. Craven acknowledges that the Mazzulli reports satisfy three of the four admissibility criteria from R. v. Mohan, : there is agreement that the applicable standard of care is an issue on the case, that expert opinion is necessary to assist the court in determining the standard of care, and the Mazzulli reports meet all of the requirements of the Supreme Court Civil Rules regarding the tendering of expert reports and do not come within an exclusionary rule\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "5  The defendant Dr. Craven's challenge to the admissibility of the Mazzulli reports is grounded in the fourth Mohan criteria: he says Dr. Mazzulli is not a properly qualified expert. The defendant Dr. Craven submits that in order to be properly qualified to provide opinion evidence regarding the applicable standard of care an expert must be familiar with the practice of emergency medicine and the work environment of an Emergency Department of a rural hospital similar to the West Coast General Hospital\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "6  In other words, the defendant Dr. Craven argues Dr. Mazzulli's specialization and the locale of his practice precludes admissibility of his opinion for the purpose of establishing the relevant standard of care. He points out that Dr. Mazzulli is a highly trained specialist, while Dr. Craven is a general practitioner and that Dr. Mazzulli's experience is limited to practising his specialty in a Toronto (\"urban\") hospital while Dr. Craven, at the relevant time, was practising in the Emergency Department of a \"rural\" hospital. In support of his argument, the defendant relies heavily on Chen v. Ross, \n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "7  The plaintiff opposes the dismissal against Dr. Craven because she says the Mazzulli reports are admissible under the Supreme Court Civil Rules and according to the relevant authorities. The plaintiff characterizes Dr. Craven's objections to Dr. Mazzulli's qualifications as not relevant to the issue of admissibility, but rather, best considered as relevant to the question of weight\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "8  The defendant VIHA takes no position. The parties' 15-day trial starts May 26, 2014. I am not the trial judge\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "9  The parties disputed whether it was appropriate to use a summary trial to determine the admissibility of the Mazzulli reports. A summary trial can be used to determine an issue as long as the court is able to find the necessary facts, decide the issues of law, and it would not be unjust to make a determination, Supreme Court Civil Rules, R. 9-7(15). In support of the claim that a summary trial is suitable the defendant Dr. Craven has attempted to narrowly define the issue before me. He says \"the only issue Dr. Craven is seeking to have determined on this summary trial is the admissibility of Dr. Mazzulli's standard of care opinion\" and characterizes this issue as a \"question of law that can be resolved summarily by reference to the report and other materials in the record.\" He has placed Dr. Mazzulli's c.v. and the Mazzulli reports before me on this summary trial\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "10  The complication in this situation is that the defendant Dr. Craven is essentially requesting that a ruling on admissibility of expert opinion evidence be made within the confines of a summary trial instead of in the context of the full trial that is scheduled to proceed in five weeks. The use of a summary trial for this purpose conflicts with the principle that the admissibility of evidence is best determined in the context of a full evidentiary record which, in this case, would include evidence of the credentials of the proffered expert that can be tested through cross-examination. Furthermore, determining the admissibility of expert opinion at a summary trial may fetter the discretion of the trial judge; this weighs against allowing the summary trial to proceed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "11  When the admissibility of an expert opinion is challenged, on the basis that the expert is not a \"qualified expert\", the party tendering the opinion has the onus to prove that the opinion is admissible, Turpin v. Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, . This onus does not shift because there is an application for judgment by summary trial, Gichuru v. Pallai, , para. 35. Consequently, if a summary trial was granted the plaintiff would have to prove the admissibility of the Mazzulli reports without the benefits provided by allowing the expert to testify on a voir dire\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "12  I have determined that it is inappropriate to decide the discrete issue the defendant Dr. Craven raises, namely, the admissibility of the Mazzulli reports on this summary trial. I am satisfied that to do so would create an injustice for the following reasons\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "13  First, the plaintiff is not tendering the expert opinion at this time and it is not necessary to scrutinize it prior to trial. The defendant Dr. Craven has relied on Hoskin v. Han, , in which the Court of Appeal emphasized that a judge must act as a gatekeeper when expert opinion evidence is tendered and that the judge must be satisfied that an expert is qualified in the area for which their opinion is offered. However, at para. 70, Hoskin quoted R. v. J.-L.J., , where the Court wrote \"The admissibility of the expert evidence should be scrutinized at the time it is proffered\". It is clear that the plaintiff is not proffering the Mazzulli reports at this time\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "14  Second, I do not take the authorities put before me as establishing that a specialist cannot provide expert opinion regarding the standard of care applicable to a non-specialist physician. The defendant Dr. Craven provides authorities that he says support his contention that a specialist can only provide an opinion regarding the standard applicable to another practice area when the specialist has experience and familiarity in that other practice area, see Kivisalu v. Brown, ; Chen\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "15  The plaintiff responds that Dr. Mazzulli clearly has expertise in the area of infectious diseases and medical microbiology and it does not matter that he did not acquire that expertise by working as an emergency room physician, referring to R. v. Marquand,  in support. The plaintiff also refers me to Lotocky (Litigation Guardian of) v. Markle, , where Macaulay J. was faced with a situation where an expert opinion from an Ontario obstetrician was tendered to address the standard of care applicable to a general practitioner. Mr. Justice Macaulay, in consideration of the law as stated in Phillips v. Central Cariboo Chilcotin Council,  and Grennan Estate v. Reddoch,  (C.A.), admitted the opinion of the obstetrician and determined that the divergence in expertise between the expert and the defendant went to weight, not admissibility. There is another line of judicial reasoning that follows Phillips for the proposition that the specialization of a medical expert is not a relevant consideration when determining admissibility: Ewert v. Marshall, ; McLellan v. Dickinson, \n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  Similarly, I am not persuaded that it is a simple \"matter of law\" that a practitioner in Ontario cannot provide an expert opinion regarding the standard of care applicable in Port Alberni. The defendant Dr. Craven relies heavily on Kivisalu, Maher v. Sutton, , and Chen, as establishing that a non-local practitioner's opinion is inadmissible\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  In Kivisalu the plaintiff relied on two expert opinions from doctors that practiced in the U.S. and McKinnon J. determined that one expert did not have the required expertise and the other had no experience in British Columbia. However, McKinnon J. avoided determining the issue of the admissibility of the opinion of the expert with no experience in British Columbia by stating that the opinion \"if admissible\" and \"even if accepted\" could \"not establish any causal link\", para. 37\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  In Maher, the expert, Dr. Fromer, had never practiced in Canada and Mr. Justice Sewell explained that he was concerned that Dr. Fromer had not consulted with either a practitioner in British Columbia nor \"made any effort to consult any published standards of practice approved by professional bodies in British Columbia or Canada\", para. 56. This reference to professional bodies in Canada indicates a distinction between foreign experts and experts in Canada\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  In Chen, Madam Justice Ballance determined that an expert, trained and working in China, lacked familiarity with the standard of care for Canadian doctors and that fact was \"fatal to the admission of his evidence\" and that his \"opinion evidence would not assist [the court] is forming a correct judgment on the standard of care\", para. 66\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "20  However, in reaching this decision Madam Justice Ballance analyzed the authorities regarding what she termed the \"locality rule\". Her conclusion was that a distinction could be made between doctors that trained and practised outside of Canada and those that were trained or qualified to practice medicine in a different locality within Canada and that opinion evidence of the latter was admissible. At para 47:\n",
      "Contemporary judicial thinking tends to endorse the approach that the differences in the locality of medical practices as between the defendant doctor and experts who have been trained and/or qualified to practise medicine elsewhere in Canada are considerations that go to the weight of the expert evidence, rather than to its admission: Phillips v. Central Cariboo Chilcotin Council,  at para. 27; Lotocky (Litigation Guardian of) v. Markle, ; Larson v. Lucky, ; and, generally, Lush v. Connell, . The rationale underlying the change is explained by E.I. Picard in her text, \"Legal Liability of Doctors and Hospitals in Canada\" (3d ed.) at p. 206:\n",
      "The rule was created by the judiciary for the limited purpose of protecting some doctors at a certain time in our history, but times have changed. Now, with national standards of competence set by professional examinations and the development of continuing medical education, there seems less need to lower the standard on the basis of locality alone.\n",
      "It is generally not essential that the expert be familiar with the available resources at the defendant doctor's disposal or the accepted practices in the defendant doctor's professional community in order for the opinion to gain admission. However, those factors may very well negatively affect the weight ultimately accorded to it: (See generally: Phillips; Robinson v. Sisters of St. Joseph of the Diocese of Peterborough in Ontario  (Ont. C.A.); Briffett v. Gander & District Hospital Board  (Nfld. C.A.))\n",
      "ONE OF LAST 5 PARAGRAPHS - DAMAGES HERE???\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "21  Consequently, I am not satisfied that the determination of the admissibility of the Mazzulli reports is a simple matter of law. I am of the view that the cases relied upon by the defendant Dr. Craven do not unequivocally support his assertion that Dr. Mazzulli's credentials and locale of practice require that a trial judge must conclude his opinion is inadmissible. I am persuaded that it would be unjust for me to determine the admissibility of the Mazzulli reports in a summary trial; in order that justice is done, the question of admissibility is best left to the trial judge in this case\n",

      "1   In the two actions before the court, three accidents, none of which were the fault of the plaintiff, give rise to a claim for damages. The first occurred on September 19, 2008. The second and third occurred on July 23, 2009 and on June 1, 2013, respectively. Liability has been admitted for each, with the exception that contributory negligence is pled in connection with the first accident.

Two weeks after this marriage, the plaintiff learned that her husband had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. As time went on she took on a greater and greater role in the operation of the farm, which consisted of three sections, mostly in grain, with a herd of 100-130 head of cattle\n",

He could not work and the plaintiff took employment at a Brownies' chicken franchise for about a year. Then they started an enterprise called Anita's organic mill. They had some success with this, and the plaintiff decided to open up a bakery. The mill and bakery were heavy work and she appears to have developed some chronic back issues as a result\n",

She began contract work painting hydro towers, and also obtained a flagging ticket and a PE Fusion ticket which allowed her to work on gas installations. She worked for a company called McDonald and Ross on construction contracts until she was laid off in January of 2008. She then drew employment insurance, and, in connection with that program, completed training as a hydraulic excavator operator in June of 2008\n",

      "13  The plaintiff saw her general practitioner, Dr. Whetter, concerning the first accident on September 22, 2008, or three days after it happened, and saw him thereafter as described in a report dated March 3, 2010:\n",
      "I first saw Anita Mosimann following her MVA of September 19, 2008 on September 22, 2008 in my office. Since that time I have seen her on September 26, 2008, October 3, October 10, October 24, November 10, November 19, November 21, December 19, January 6, 2009, April 27,2009, May 20, July 10, July 27, July 31, August 24, September 2, January 22, 2010, February 4,2010 and my last visit March 1, 2010.\n",
      "On my initial assessment on 22 September 2008 in my office I reviewed the mechanism of the accident. There was a tremendous impact. She was belted in but there was no airbags in the truck. Even though Anita saw the oncoming car and was able to brace herself her face hit the dashboard and she received a terrific jolt in her upper body. Initial superficial injuries were a bruised forehead with bruising and swelling around her left eye including a hematoma and a bruise across the bridge of her nose.\n",
      "Her myofascial symptoms involved her neck, both shoulders (especially the left) with pain radiating from the left shoulder part way down the arm. She also complained of pain in her upper thoracic spine, again mostly on the left.\n",
      "On examination she had a stiff neck with a lot of palpable tenderness and spasm. Range of motion of her neck was limited to about 75% of normal, particularly in rotation and side bending to the right. There was tenderness and palpable spasm from her neck down into the area between her scapulae and including the muscles over her left scapulae and into her left rotator cuff of her shoulder. She also had symptoms suggestive of a sciatic pain into her right buttock, the back of her right leg and down to the heel. Range of motion of her lower back was quite good. She could almost touch her toes.\n",
      "In subsequent visits through October and November the persisting problems were constant pain, in the back of her neck, constant pain in her left shoulder and left scapular area as well as the upper thoracic spine, particularly medial to the left scapulae. She was also more aware of continuing pain in her nose.\n",
      "Through these visits it was very obvious that she was having a major difficulty with suffering psychologically and showed all the symptoms of a post-traumatic stress disorder. Her nose was x-rayed and turned out to be fractured and somewhat deformed and she was referred to Dr. Kloppers, then referred to a Dr. Tsai. Her nasal symptoms now included hypersensitivity to her nose, in other words any sharp smells or change in temperature or dust, caused her burning pain in her nose. Through December and into January 2009 her main problems continued to be #1 post traumatic stress disorder, #2 pain and sensitivity in her nose with sinus symptoms and #3 continuing constant pain in her neck, left thoracic spine and shoulder-blade area and left shoulder. She continued to have palpable tenderness and spasm in the back of her neck, more on the left in the upper thoracic area on the left side medial to and over top of her shoulder-blade and into her rotator cuff. Specifically she was tender along her left supraspinatus right to the insertion as well as her infraspinatus to the insertion and her upper biceps tendon all in the left rotator cuff. These symptoms and findings continued through the spring of 2009.1 reassessed her on April 27th and she had some slight improvement but no major changes. In May her symptomatology was the same although she had more complaints now of a frontal sinusitis and burning and sensitivity in her nose with a watery nasal discharge and a frontal headache.\n",
      "She had her fractured nose relocated and repaired by Dr. Tsai - this was followed with episodes of heavy post-op bleeding, nasal swelling and obstruction which caused her to panic. Through the fall of 2009 she had some small improvements but still had the same major complaints and problems and continued to have evidence of post traumatic stress such as extreme anxiety at times, nightmares causing insomnia and great difficulty riding in a car, particularly at night with oncoming headlights. I saw her again in January and February of 2010 - her symptoms to do with her neck, upper thoracic spine and particularly left side and her left rotator cuff were all still present but continuing to improve. Her main-complaints at this time were again of a very sensitive nose, acutely reacting to dust, temperature change and any unusual smells.\n",
      "Her treatment initially was IBUPROFEN, physio, heat and ice, ATIVAN and counselling. She was also put on TRAZODONE 50 to 100 mg to take at bedtime to help her sleep. In October 2008 she was receiving counselling and chiropractic treatments as well as her physio. Her physio treatments at the physiotherapist's, and also with her exercises at home, helped with her range of motion but her pains and symptoms were very slow to improve. During her symptoms of sinusitis in May 2009 she was put on an antibiotic called AVELOX for 14 days and given a FLUTICASONE nasal spray. She was continuing also to use IBUPROFEN.\n",
      "Following her nasal surgery she was continued on ATIVAN .5 sublingual for her anxiety and some ADVAIR 250 for episodes of shortness of breath. She also used a nasal irrigation and in early 2010 started treatments with acupuncture.\n",
      "My last visit with Anita and her common-law husband was on the 1st of March 2010. I reviewed all of her injuries with her and got her to give me a ballpark assessment of how much she had improved since the original accident. She felt that she was 85 to 90% better in her physical symptoms but was only about 80% improved in her mental status. Her main symptoms and disability was mostly from the sharp pains in her nose resulting in intermittent nasal obstruction, dyspnea and panic. At this time she continues to have pain and palpable muscle tenderness in the left side of her neck posteriorly and around and medial to the left scapula. Range of motion in her back and her neck is almost normal although there is still some restriction in her neck in side bending to the left. Range of motion of both shoulders is normal. She also continues to have some numbness of the upper gums above and around her upper incisors and says she continues to have some loss of smell and taste since her nasal surgery.\n",
      "Prognosis for Anita: She will never completely recover from her post traumatic stress disorder and will continue to be frightened at times in traffic, particularly with oncoming headlights. She may continue to have nightmares. It seems like she will also continue to have some sensitivity and pain in her nose. I believe that the myofascial injury symptoms in her neck and left upper back and left shoulder will continue to improve to maybe 95 or even 100% of normal. [Emphasis added.\n",

      "14  The plaintiff's treatment has since been taken over by Dr. Jessica Kennedy. In a report dated August 5, 2013 she summarized her involvement:\n",
      "My initial office visits with Anita were focused on her nasal symptoms which caused her a huge amount of anxiety and were interfering with her ability to function (July 20, July 31, August 13, August 24, October 11, 2012, Feb 1, and May 15 [Dr. Noble], 2013). She perseverated on her nasal symptoms and was overwhelmed by them, usually crying in my office whenever she spoke of her nose or nasal symptoms. I believe this is because it was triggering symptoms of PTSD. Anita often spoke about how her nasal symptoms reminded her of the MVA of September 19, 2008. She reported that even touching or thinking about her nose would cause emotional distress. She had a couple of acute on chronic sinusitis episodes which responded to Septra and nasal steroids. July 31, 2012 she reported a worsening of the nasal pain and pressure which she rated at an 8-10/10 in terms of severity, and was located in the area of the frontal and maxillary sinuses. Symptoms were worsened by elevation changes (i.e. driving up and down hills) which would cause her to feel nauseated and presyncopal (light-headed) as well. Her nasal discharge was thick but clear and I treated her with Septra. August 13, 2012 Anita reported that her sinus pain and congestion had improved to a baseline of 3/10 in terms of severity. She still had flares of pain twice a week that were 10/10 in severity but this was much improved from the daily symptoms she had been experiencing. She also reported that day that she had a chronic dry cough that I thought may be from postnasal drip so I asked her to continue on her nasonex. August 24, 2012, Anita informed me that Dr. Tsai was planning on sending her for a CT of her sinuses. October 11, 2012 I reviewed Dr. Javer's report and referred her to get allergy testing as he had recommended. Anita reported again her difficulties with pain over the bridge of her nose that worsened with elevation changes while driving. She described it as a twisting sensation and it caused her to become nauseated. This led to vomiting on two instances. I asked her to review this with Dr. Tsai as he was seeing her four days later and he had asked her to follow up with him if she was having difficulties. Her CT scan had showed mild chronic maxillary and sphenoid sinusitis. February 1, 2013, Anita presented with another acute on chronic sinusitis which caused increased pain, pressure and postnasal drip. I treated her with Septra antibiotics and nasonex. Of note, I referred Anita to the chronic pain clinic in Surrey on June 20, 2013 to have them review her chronic nasal pain. This appointment is still pending.\n",
      "In March 2013, Anita started to present to discuss emotional difficulties that she was having, especially anxiety while driving or even as a passenger (March 7, April 2, June 5, June 11, June 20, June 28, July 12 [Dr. Whetter], July 17 and August 16, 2013). She reported looking at the wheels of on-coming traffic to ensure that the vehicles were not driving towards her. She had anxiety attacks, usually related to driving. She was working with a counsellor, Jane Byra, who was doing EMDR, a form of treatment for PTSD. These counselling sessions had improved her psychological symptoms somewhat, but Anita felt she had plateaued and was not making further progress. I recommended that she try getting in to see a counsellor with the Anne Davis Society as they are well known for treating PTSD, however apparently they only help women who are victims of violence. I also recommended trying to find a community therapy driving program which a previous specialist had recommended for another patient that I had been treating with driving phobia and PTSD. Unfortunately we have been unable to find anyone who actually provides this service. Anita eventually changed to Lorne Peirce who she has continued her counselling with. Initially she felt she was making some progress, but then she had the MVA on June 1, 2013 and Anita suffered a severe worsening of her anxiety and PTSD symptoms. She could not cope with activities of daily living, could not perform any mental tasks including paperwork or even remembering what she had done that day. She felt extremely unsafe and remained in her husband's presence in order to feel safer and because she did not trust what her reactions would be. She presented June 5, 2013 in a state of extreme agitation and I started her on cipralex 10 mg and prescribed her several Ativan to take during panic attacks. Anita was very reluctant to take any medications. I referred her to the Rapid Access Clinic for expedited psychiatric review. She developed extrapyramidal side effects from the Cipralex and discontinued it. Dr. Brinks saw her at the Rapid Access Clinic and diagnosed her with PTSD, panic disorder, Mood Disorder NOS, and Specific Phobia. She started Anita on Sertraline which has had a good effect at improving Anita's mood, anxiety and functioning. The dose has gradually been titrated up to 125 mg per day. Anita does report that the medication causes her to be drowsy, and her depression symptoms are not completely controlled. She has difficulties with motivation and finds it difficult to force herself to do simple tasks around the house, or to do administration tasks such as accounting/bookkeeping. Anita continues to struggle with her PTSD, especially when driving or being in a car. Her symptoms are now starting to regress, however she has suffered a great set back in terms of her mental health. I have asked her to stop driving the pilot car as I feel it puts her in situations with abnormal traffic patterns that increase her likelihood of triggering her PTSD (i.e. August 16, 2013 she reported that a semi-trailer \"charged'' at her because the driver was frustrated that he could not pass her.) If her symptoms do not improve, I plan to increase her sertraline to 150 mg per day\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "15  Dr. Kennedy believes that the plaintiff is presently incapacitated:\n",
      "Anita is still quite incapacitated by her mental health barriers. I believe her diagnoses include PTSD, depression and anxiety, of which I think the PTSD is the most significant problem. She is struggling to do her activities of daily living such as housework and office work due to low mood, poor motivation and fatigue. She is experiencing high levels of anxiety in public and reports having anxiety attacks while driving. She is very frustrated that her anxiety/PTSD is inhibiting her ability to perform mental tasks and driving. She complains of poor memory and difficulties with mental tasks such as bookkeeping that she was able to do prior to her accidents\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  Dr. Kennedy addressed the plaintiff's employment prospects:\n",
      "I believe that her depression is currently inhibiting her from being gainfully employed doing clerical work. However, I believe that with time, counselling and medication, Anita's anxiety and depression should improve sufficiently to allow her to do some part-time work similar to what she was doing before (i.e. bookkeeping and some office work). I expect that there will be times when her anxiety and depression will flare from time to time and this may interfere with employment at those times. [Emphasis added.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  Dr. Kennedy addressed her general disability and its effect on the activities of daily life:\n",
      "I feel the PTSD is impairing Anita's ability to cope with her facial pain, and I feel the PTSD is [exacerbating] her depression and anxiety symptoms, and complicating the treatment of her pain and mood symptoms. Taken together, I believe her mental health and pain symptoms have created a severe disability that is greatly impairing her activities of daily living as well as her recreational, social and household activities. I feel her pain and PTSD will be permanent and this will impair these functions indefinitely, however I am hopeful that the severity will decrease with time. At this point I cannot comment on how functional she will be personally in the future\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  As described by Dr. Whetter, it was determined that surgery was required on the plaintiff's nose. Dr. Vance Tsai performed the surgery. He reported:\n",
      "Surgery was performed on July 20, 2009. Intra-operative progress was uncomplicated. Post-operative recovery was complicated by epistaxis for which she had nasal packing. Nasal packing in this setting can sometimes predispose to increased intranasal scarring. Further recovery has been complicated by hyposmia and paresthesias in the upper palate and lip.\n",
      "...\n",
      "From a nasal/sinus perspective, she complains primarily of three issues:\n",
      "Numbness along the palate and upper lip.\n",
      "This developed after her nasal operation. I would agree with Dr. Javer's opinion that \"this is a common complication\" due to injury to the nasopalatine nerve. Now that it is more than four years since the onset, I would conclude that this is unlikely to improve from here.\n",
      "Hyposmia\n",
      "I would also agree with Dr. Javer's opinion that it is difficult to interpret her current sense of smell since testing was not performed prior to surgery and prior to the MVA. She did not complain prominently of hyposmia prior to the operation though. Nonetheless, her pre-operative nasal septal deviation and sinus inflammation is often associated with hyposmia symptoms.\n",
      "3. Rhinalgia, midface and peri-orbital pain\n",
      "These complaints existed prior to surgery and were not improved by surgery. There is suggestion that surgery may have exacerbated her situation as it improved nasal airflow and this can be an irritant. I would suggest that this occurred to neurological pain fiber involvement secondary to the MVA and potentially exacerbated by the nasal operation.\n",
      "I would agree with the opinion from Dr. Javer that I would not recommend any further treatment at this point. Given the trajectory of her improvement or lack of improvement so far, I am afraid that her current symptomatology will likely persist.\n",
      "Psychiatric assessment by Dr. Anderson on Sep 22, 2011 suggested preferred psychiatric diagnosis of \"chronic adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood\". Further assessment from Dr. Semrau on May 30, 2012 quoted the following \"The biggest thing is my nose. It doesn't feel the same.\".. . My nose doesn't look the same. My dad and I had the same nose. Maybe that's why it bothers me so much. I don't know why I can't get past my nose.\"\n",
      "It is not common for her current nasal symptoms to produce prominent occupation nor recreational disabilities. Her hyposmia could become an issue with some activities such as cooking. Given the psychiatric reports provided, I think that further improvements could be considered from this perspective\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  Dr. Javer observed:\n",
      "Assessment and Impression:\n",
      "It is obvious and unfortunate that the MVA on the 19th of September 2008 has left a lasting impact on Ms. Mosimann's functioning and on her life including her ability to work.\n",
      "With respect to her sinonasal cavity, I can not find any objective reason why she is having the feel of reduced oxygen going into her lungs. Her nasal cavities look very open and healthy on endoscopy. The numbness on the upper lip and palate is most likely due to injury to the nasopalatine nerve that supplies this region and travels through the septum. This nerve is often traumatized during septoplasty particularly if the septum requires surgery at the level of the maxillary crest. This is a common complication and may or may not resolve itself. It is hard to understand why Ms Mosimann has a reduced sense of smell but since a previous smell test had not been done prior to the surgery or prior to her MVA it is difficult to interpret this result. We do not know what her smell test would have scored prior to the surgery or MVA. Her midfacial pain and periorbital pain may very well be secondary to neurological pain fiber involvement secondary to both the MVA and/or the surgery although she did have pain prior to the operation. She states that her nasal pain is now worse particularly in the cold and sometimes that can happen if there is increased air entry into the nose. This is possibly happening because her septum has been straightened and there is more air entering her nose and her nerve endings in her nose are exposed to increased irritants and is likely creating neurogenic pain particularly in a colder environment.\n",
      "With respect to recommendation for further treatment; Ms Mosimann does not need any further surgery to her nose or her sinuses since everything looks quite healthy and functioning well from my perspective. I would advise against any other surgical therapy. As far as medical treatment is concerned she could use very conservative measures such as Vaseline in her nose which will help humidify and moisturize the air as well as protect her nasal cavities. She does not need any assistive devices.\n",
      "Some patients have had success with using Capsaicin nasal spray in their nose and this is something that she could certainly try in the future if things don't resolve. Another thing that maybe helpful for her is to get formal allergy testing to see if she is indeed allergic to dust mites since she can be taught and advised on preventative measures which may improve her nighttime quality of life.\n",
      "As far as her long term prognosis is concerned I am afraid that she will probably continue to require counseling with respect to her post traumatic stress disorder which I think will most likely continue since this was a significant event in her life. With respect to her nose, I suspect that she will continue to have sensitivity and pain in her nose secondary to neurogenic pain. [Emphasis added.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "20  It should be noted that there are several references among the treating physicians to post traumatic stress and psychiatric factors. The plaintiff was assessed by two psychiatrists for medical-legal purposes. Dr. Stephen D. Anderson was engaged by the plaintiff, and Dr. Stanley Semrau was consulted by the defence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "21  Dr. Anderson summarized his findings following an attendance on September 15, 2011 and an extensive review of the records, as follows:\n",
      "...\n",
      "I would like to make the following recommendations for further assessment and treatment of Ms. Anita Mosimann:\n",
      "Ms. Mosimann requires further psychotherapy with an experienced counsellor or psychologist. I suggest that Ms. Mosimann and Mr. Wear continue to see their present counsellor, Ms. Jane Byra, for another twenty sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) before re-assessing the need for further treatment.\n",
      "Ms. Mosimann is unlikely to benefit from a therapeutic dose of antidepressant medication at the present time. She may require treatment with Ativan (anti-anxiety) medication in future if she has severe panic attacks. I will defer opinion regarding analgesic medication to physical medicine specialists.\n",
      "I suggest that Ms. Mosimann have an updated assessment from an ENT specialist to determine whether her nasal deformity could be ameliorated and whether her facial pain and associated symptoms (dysosmia and rhinorrhea) could be reduced.\n",
      "I suggest that Ms. Mosimann be enrolled in a supervised exercise program. Regular aerobic exercise may reduce her anxiety and depressive symptoms provided it does not cause a worsening of her pain.\n",
      "I suggest that Ms. Mosimann be assessed in her home by an occupational therapist to better determine the effect that her injuries have had on her lifestyle, including homemaking, sports and social activities.\n",
      "Ms. Mosimann requires a vocational assessment in order to develop a better understanding of her long-term vocational prognosis.\n",
      "Long-term prognosis for Ms. Anita Mosimann, from a psychiatric point of view, is guarded. It has been over three years since the first MVA occurred and Ms. Mosimann continues to have significant emotional difficulties. I anticipate that Ms. Mosimann will have a reduction of her anxiety and depressive symptoms over time with further psychotherapy. However, Ms. Mosimann is emotionally vulnerable and at risk of deteriorating in future if she is exposed to further trauma or if her physical symptoms (e.g. facial pain) should worsen as she ages. Ms. Mosimann's vocational limitations are likely primarily due to her physical symptoms following the September 19th, 2008 MVA. I will defer the prognosis of her physical symptoms to physical medicine specialist. [Emphasis added.\n",

      "22  Dr. Semrau interviewed the plaintiff on April 12, 2012. He also wrote a very extensive report. His overview was as follows:\n",
      "Overview of Opinion\n",
      "This report deals with accidents which have occurred on the following dates: September 19, 2008 and July 23, 2009. References below to \"the accident\" should be understood to refer to the accident of September 19, 2008 and it should be understood to be the reference point for the descriptors \"pre-accident\", \"post-accident\", etc.\n",
      "Ms. Mosimann's pre-accident history does not include any significant prior mental health problems.\n",
      "As a result of these accidents Ms. Mosimann has experienced significant vehicle travel anxiety/avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptoms, now partially recovered. These symptoms have been psychologically interwoven with physical symptoms relating to a nasal injury from the first accident.\n",
      "Ms. Mosimann has also developed some depressive and anxiety symptoms, mostly as a result of these accidents, now also partially recovered.\n",
      "Ms. Mosimann has sometimes complained of difficulties with memory and concentration. These have been caused by pain and emotional factors. Ms. Mosimann did not experience a brain injury in either of these accidents.\n",
      "The mental health treatment provided to Ms. Mosimann has been generally appropriate and somewhat helpful.\n",
      "Future mental health treatment for Ms. Mosimann should include further counseling, mainly focused on the remaining posttraumatic stress symptoms.\n",
      "Ms. Mosimann's mental health prognosis is good, in that she has already quite significantly recovered and with further treatment, it is likely that most remaining mental health symptoms will resolve.\n",
      "Regarding Ms. Mosimann's work and educational capacities, any mental health symptoms arising from this accident are no longer significantly limiting and are unlikely to interfere in future either.\n",
      "[Emphasis added.\n",

      "\n",
      "23  Dr. Anderson saw the plaintiff again on August 22, 2013. His opinion on that occasion was as follows:\n",
      "Since last assessing Ms. Mosimann she was involved in a third MVA on June 1st, 2013. Ms. Mosimann had a marked exacerbation of her anxiety and depressive symptoms following the third MVA. Her physical symptoms did not worsen as a result of the third MVA. The June 1st, 2013 MVA was a minor MVA, from a physical point of view, but it significantly exacerbated Ms. Mosimann's emotional difficulties. Ms. Mosimann was still recovering emotionally from the first two MVA's when the third MVA occurred. She had a significant setback in her emotional recovery as a result of the June 1st, 2013 MVA.\n",
      "When I previously interviewed Ms. Mosimann in October 2009 and September 2011 she did not have sufficient symptoms to warrant the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder. Ms. Mosimann now has a major depressive disorder of moderate severity. Ms. Mosimann's \"depressive symptoms\" overlap with symptoms due to pain and anxiety and include depressed mood (three to five out of ten), marked tearfulness, hopelessness, helplessness, low self-esteem, weight gain, decreased libido (likely partly due to medication side effects), cognitive impairment, reduced energy, reduced motivation and drive, poor self-confidence, insomnia, social withdrawal, decreased enjoyment of life, irritability and self-consciousness/mourning regarding her nasal symptoms.

      "I had previously reviewed the report of Dr. Anderson dated September 22, 2011, in the process of preparing my May 30, 2012 report.\n",
      "Dr. Anderson notes that Ms. Mosimann was involved in a 3rd MVA on June 1, 2013 and also states that she has experienced emotional/mood deterioration, increased driving fears and required antidepressant medication since then.\n",
      "Obviously I am not in a position to provide any independent comments regarding the role which this latest MVA might have had with respect to the evolution of Ms. Mosimann's symptoms from the first 2 MVAs. However I would say as a matter of general principle that exacerbation of Ms. Mosimann's particular prior symptoms following a subsequent MVA is entirely unsurprising, so I have no particular reason to question Dr. Anderson's opinions in that regard.\n",
      "Dr. Anderson now diagnoses Ms. Mosimann as suffering from a Major Depressive Disorder (page 6) and lists various symptoms consistent with such a diagnosis. Again, I am unable to independently assess the current degree of depression. However generally speaking, worsened depression would be unsurprising under these circumstances.\n",
      "Dr. Anderson indicates that he is \"largely in agreement\" with my own prior diagnoses of PTSD in partial remission and vehicle anxiety (Anderson page 7). I agree with his agreement.\n",

      "26  I have recounted the medical evidence at considerable length because the case is difficult, in some respects, to assess on the basis of the courtroom evidence. Normally the court hears the plaintiff and the lay witnesses and accepts those aspects of the medical evidence that are congruent with the experiences described in-chief and tested on cross-examination. The plaintiff presents as a person who is susceptible to major trauma over trivial events. Her reactions seem quite out of proportion to her challenges, as do those of Mr. Wear. It is apparent that they both live in a rather fraught atmosphere. I would have been highly skeptical of the plaintiff's claims, but for the strong medical evidence, although it remains somewhat at odds with the impression left by the plaintiff herself\n",

      "27  Before the accident of September 19, 2008, the evidence is that the plaintiff had managed the vicissitudes of life, of which she had had her share, without resort to medical or therapeutic care. The accident was serious and caused both Mr. Wear and the plaintiff physical harm. It was not, however, life-threatening, given the difference in size between the vehicle which struck them, which was demolished, and the truck in which they were riding.\n",

      "\n",
      "29  Mr. Lukar's analysis proceeded by using an exemplar vehicle (the one involved In the accident was no longer available) and placing the plaintiff in the passenger seat, demonstrating her position. It appears to be critical to the analysis that the plaintiff is short and the seat is too long for her to sit with her bottom all the way to the seatback without extending her legs. That is not evident in the third of the photos put in evidence, where the plaintiff appears to be seated comfortably back in the seat. Mr. Lukar suggests that the photograph is deceiving in that regard. The sixth photo shows the plaintiff apparently striking a part of the console, but from a position well advanced from the back of the seat. The dashboard in front of the passenger's seat is significantly farther away than an instrument panel to the left of the seat, which is what Mr. Lukar suggests the plaintiff struck\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  What the photographs did appear to show was that if the plaintiff was sitting with a properly adjusted lap belt, even allowing for some stretching or body compression that would allow the plaintiff to move forward, the arc of her upper body would fall short of hitting the dashboard. In making this observation, I am not substituting my own interpretation of the evidence for that of Mr. Lukar. I am simply saying that despite his qualifications, Mr. Lukar was not able to satisfy me that what he described displaced the inference the court might have drawn without assistance. His suggestions were simply unconvincing\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  The plaintiff's counsel submitted that the court ought to accept Mr. Lukar's evidence on the basis that an adverse inference could be drawn from the defendants' failure to produce an expert report. That is not, in my view, a proper approach to opinion evidence. While it may be risky, counsel are entitled to rely on cross-examination and argument in relation to an expert witness as with any other witness. The defendants referred to Lakhani v. Samson, , [1982] B.C.W.L.D. 1126, 70 B.C.L.R. 379 a decision of McEachern C.J.S.C. at para. 3:\n",
      "I reject the suggestion that engineering evidence is required in these cases. The court is not required to leave its common sense in the hall outside the courtroom and the evidence is clear that upon impact in both cases the Plaintiff's upper body was flung or thrown forward striking the dashboard or the steering wheel. And common sense tells me that the restraint of a shoulder harness would have prevented that, and therefore some of the injury from having occurred\n",

On those occasions, it is up to the trier of fact to decide whether the inference the expert invited has the authoritative force of training or experience, or whether it is just not helpful. Having done my best to assess Mr. Lukar's surprising conclusion - that failure to wear a lap belt would have made no difference in this face-hit-the-dashboard collision - I am simply unable to say that I am persuaded that that is the correct inference. I assess the plaintiff's contributory negligence at 25%.\n",

The first accident was serious and might have resulted in significant trauma with a somewhat extended recovery period. The second was certainly alarming. The impact occurred at a slow speed and the plaintiff's impression that their vehicle might be pushed over an overpass was objectively an overreaction, but I accept that it was genuine\n",

As a result, he says she is now a chronic psychiatric patient. Dr. Anderson suggested that the stress she has experienced has triggered changes in her brain and that she now has a neurological disorder that renders her permanently emotionally vulnerable. Virtually any stressful road event could set her back and into counselling.\n",

At the time of the first accident she was not working, having been laid off from a labouring job with McDonald and Ross in January of 2008.

She has been working with him in his business in the office, riding in his truck as a personal secretary, and operating a pilot vehicle. She earns $12,000 per month doing this, which is the same amount Mr. Wear pays himself. The available records suggest that an aggressive approach to expenses and depreciation may help to supplement the parties' income and that they are, in fact, engaged in what amounts to a joint enterprise. It is not particularly well-established whether the $12,000 is a salary, or amounts to a form of splitting income. Mr. Wear's evidence suggests that the plaintiff does not do a great deal of work. It is apparent that he works quite hard for the same amount he pays her, however\n",
      "======\n",

      "38  There is not much evidence that enables the court to gauge whether the $12,000 is the best the plaintiff can do because she is out of the competitive market for jobs, or whether it reflects a preference that is mutually satisfactory to her and to Mr. Wear\n",

On March 3. 2010 Dr. Whetter recorded that the plaintiff said she was 80-90% better in her physical symptoms and \"only\" about 80% improved in her mental status. He also noted that the plaintiff would \"never completely recover from her post traumatic stress disorder and will continue to be frightened at times in traffic, particularly with oncoming headlights.\" He noted that \"she may continue to have nightmares.

The plaintiff's self-assessment of her recovery from her physical injuries to that point seems reasonable and in accordance with the evidence. Dr. Whetter's guarded prognosis about the plaintiff's recovery from her post traumatic stress disorder, however, was obviously more accurate than the plaintiff's contemporaneous self-assessment. Whatever use may be made of such percentage estimates, the plaintiff clearly continued, and continues, to be vulnerable as Dr. Whetter suggested she might be\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "44  I think Dr. Anderson's observation that the third accident was \"the straw that broke the camel's back\" may be useful for the purpose of locating, for him, a low point in the plaintiff's ongoing struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder, but is of limited use in assessing causation. The plaintiff's condition by then was so fragile that she had a panic attack while she was performing a simple cognitive test in Dr. Anderson's office. Hearing an ambulance siren was enough to cause her acute distress. It is quite clear that by the time the plaintiff had reached the point at which the third accident occurred she was vulnerable to very mild vicissitudes, which cannot fairly be laid upon those who have otherwise caused her no harm whatsoever\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "45  The question arises as to whether there is any realistic prospect of improvement in the plaintiff's condition. Dr. Anderson gave the following prognosis:\n",
      "In summary, Ms. Mosimann has deteriorated emotionally since she was last seen in September 2011. Ms. Mosimann's preferred psychiatric diagnoses at the present time would be a major depressive disorder of moderate severity and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As I indicated in my last report, Ms. Mosimann was emotionally vulnerable and at risk of deteriorating if she was exposed to further trauma. Although the June 1st, 2013 MVA was minor, from a physical point of view, it caused a significant deterioration in Ms. Mosimann's emotional functioning.\n",
      "Long-term prognosis for Ms. Mosimann remains guarded. Despite further treatment and the passage of time, she will likely continue to have anxiety and depressive symptoms and not return to her premorbid level of emotional functioning. Ms. Mosimann also has ongoing physical symptoms. I am deferring the etiology, diagnosis and prognosis of her physical symptoms to physical medicine specialists. She has, however, been diagnosed with having neuropathic pain by ENT specialists. I therefore suggest that Ms. Mosimann be given a trial of medication for neuropathic pain such as Gabapentin or Pregabalin. She may also benefit from treatment with low dose tricyclic antidepressant medication at night (e.g. Nortriptyline).\n",
      "Cognitively, Ms. Mosimann continues to have concentration, memory and multitasking difficulties. She continues to score below the normal range on routine cognitive screening (MOCA 24 out of 30). Some of Ms. Mosimann's cognitive difficulties may be due to English not being her first language. Ms. Mosimann's cognitive functioning likely deteriorates at times when she has increased anxiety, depression, pain, fatigue and/or general stress.\n",
      "With respect to recommendations, Ms. Mosimann will likely require ongoing psychotherapy with a registered psychologist. She may require long-term supportive psychotherapy. Ms. Mosimann may also require treatment with antidepressant medication on a long-term basis. As indicated in my last report, Ms. Mosimann should also be enrolled in a supervised exercise program. Regular aerobic exercise may improve her mood and reduce her anxiety. An occupational therapist also needs to be involved in Ms. Mosimann's care. Ms. Mosimann may benefit from learning cognitive remediation strategies for improving her concentration and memory and she may benefit from ergonomic interventions to reduce her neck and shoulder pain. Finally, Ms. Mosimann requires a vocational assessment. Ms. Mosimann completed an excavator operator course prior to the 2008 MVA occurring but she would not likely be able to work at that job due to her physical, cognitive and emotional difficulties. Ms. Mosimann's vocational options have narrowed significantly as a result of the three MVA's.\n",
      "Ms. Mosimann's present emotional difficulties are likely due to the MVA's of September 19th, 2008, July 23rd, 2009 and June 1st, 2013. Ms. Mosimann did not have a history of psychiatric illness prior to the 2008 MVA occurring. She was able to cope well emotionally following the death of her first husband in a car accident. Ms. Mosimann did not have driving fears until following the 2008 MVA.\n",
      "As a result of her symptoms Ms. Mosimann continues to have a decrease in the overall quality of her life. There also continues to be a strain placed on her relationship with Mr. Wear due to her emotional changes following the MVA's (e.g. irritability).\n",
      "I trust this report may be of some help in understanding Ms. Anita Mosimann and in providing direction for further assessment and treatment. As indicated in my last report, the longer psychiatric disorders last the less likely they are to remit with treatment. Patients who have more than one disorder also have a much poorer prognosis. In Ms. Mosimann's case, she has at least two psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder and PTSD, in addition to having chronic pain. It is highly unlikely that Ms. Mosimann will return to her premorbid level of emotional functioning despite further treatment and the passage of time. Instead, she will likely continue to have anxiety and depressive symptoms on a long-term basis and be at increased risk of deteriorating in future if she is exposed to further trauma or if her physical symptoms (e.g. facial pain) should worsen as she ages.\n",

I say so giving as much credence as possible to the plaintiff's claims that she is much less active now than she was before the accidents, and that her interest in these things has diminished as her condition has worsened with the second and third accidents. I think putting this litigation behind her will help her considerably, and that a course of cognitive behaviour therapy should assist the plaintiff in adopting coping strategies that will be beneficial.

It is possible that had work been available in one of the occupations she was capable of pursuing, she would have taken such a position, but there is not much evidence that there were such opportunities, or whether they would have been full or part time or of long duration. I accept that the plaintiff has not been capable of working in those kinds of occupations for much of the time since the first accident but do not accept that damages is a simple matter of projecting a $40,000 per annum loss through that period.

      "[8] An award for loss of earning capacity is based on the recognition that a plaintiff's capacity to earn income is an asset which has been taken away: Andrews v.

Where a plaintiff's permanent injury limits him in his capacity to perform certain activities and consequently impairs his income earning capacity, he is entitled to compensation. What is being compensated is not lost projected future earnings but the loss or impairment of earning capacity as a capital asset. In some cases, projections from past earnings may be a useful factor to consider in valuing the loss but past earnings are not the only factor to consider.\n",
      "[9] Because damage awards are made as lump sums, an award for loss of future earning capacity must deal to some extent with the unknowable. The standard of proof to be applied when evaluating hypothetical events that may affect an award is simple probability, not the balance of probabilities: Athey v. Leonati, . Possibilities and probabilities, chances, opportunities, and risks must all be considered, so long as they are a real and substantial possibility and not mere speculation.

If the plaintiff discharges that burden of proof, then depending upon the facts of the case, the plaintiff may prove the quantification of that loss of earning capacity, either on an earnings approach, as in Steenblok [Steenblok v. Funk  (C.A.)], or a capital asset approach, as in Brown [Brown v. Golaiy ]. The former approach will be more useful when the loss is more easily measurable, as it was in Steenblok.

Mr. Power contends that Mr. White is responsible for the accident in that he should have been able to stop in time to avoid the collision.

      "4  At approximately 9:00 a.m. on the day of the accident Mr. Power was driving northbound on the Island Highway in his 1991 Toyota Camry, travelling from his residence in Duncan to his mother's home in Qualicum Beach. The conditions were dry and sunny. His 16 year old daughter, Desiree, was a front seat passenger in the vehicle. The accident took place approximately one mile south of the turnoff for Qualicum beach. In the area of the accident, the highway consists of four lanes, with two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes, separated by a concrete no-post barrier\n",

It was within a foot of the concrete barrier. Mr. Power thought it was going to jump over the barrier. Mr. Power thought that he was too close to the deer to stop safely before reaching its position, and was concerned that a panic stop by him would cause the deer to run into his lane, thereby causing an accident which could result in serious injuries to himself and his daughter. He decided to give the deer as much room as possible by making an immediate lane change into the right hand lane\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "8  He checked his rear view and right hand side mirror, looked over his shoulder and saw the defendant's red truck, and began making his lane change to the right hand lane. Unfortunately, while Mr. Power had his head turned, the deer darted directly into the path of Mr. Power's vehicle. When he returned his gaze to the direction of travel, the deer was in the area of the dashed line between the two travel lanes. He applied maximum braking but was unable to avoid hitting the deer. The collision with the deer occurred when he was part way into the right hand lane\n",
      "======\n",

      "10  After hitting the deer he felt momentary relief as he realized that both he and his daughter were safe. However, he immediately felt a hard impact from the rear. His vehicle was driven forward and to the left, was spun around, and after striking the concrete barrier came to rest facing southbound in the center median area\n",

She testified that prior to the accident she had her eyes closed and had her headphones on while listening to music. Just prior to the impact her father said \"Des, look at the deer.\" She saw the deer. She looked over her shoulder and saw the red truck. Her impression was that the vehicle behind them was sufficiently far away that she felt safe as her father was making the lane change. She said however \"everything happened in a blink of an eye.\n",

He was driving his red 1991 Nissan extended cab pickup truck. The truck had a canopy over the truck bed. He was towing a rented U-Haul trailer with a 5' x 8' cargo bed. The trailer is not equipped with brakes. He was accompanied by his common-law spouse, Ms. Denise Wheeler. They had personal belongings in the cab of the truck, such as clothing and a suitcase. They also had belongings in the bed of the pickup truck such as a table saw, and boxes of household goods. In the trailer there were five or six boxes of books, some furniture, and other personal belongings, estimated by Mr. White to weigh 500 or 600 lbs\n",

Just after being passed by Mr. Power's vehicle, he noticed what he described as some \"hesitation\" on the part of Mr. Power's vehicle. He thought that \"something was amiss\". He took his foot off the accelerator and placed it over the brake pedal, without applying the brakes. He said everything happened instantaneously. He saw a deer in Mr. Power's lane. He testified that Mr. Power's brake lights came on just as Mr. Power was undertaking the lane change. In response the brake lights of Mr. Power's vehicle, Mr. White applied emergency braking, but could not avoid colliding with the Power vehicle. As Mr. White was braking he was angling his vehicle towards the shoulder. He testified that he wanted to avoid going off the road to the right as there was a steep bank beyond the edge of the shoulder. He said Mr. Power's vehicle was moving \"very slowly\" when the collision with his vehicle took place\n",

      "I saw a deer land in the fast lane ahead of me. I did not see it jump the concrete barrier but it landed in front of the other car. I actually saw it land on the road. I do not know how far ahead of the other vehicle that the deer had landed. All I know is that the other vehicle was coming into my lane with brake lights on.

It was the deer's fault\" or \"It was no more your fault than mine - it was the deer's fault.\" Mr. Power also testified that he overheard Mr. White tell a police officer on scene that the accident was Mr. Power's fault.

The accident scene photograph shows a long skid mark consisting of at least 37 metres which would have been deposited by one of the front wheels of the White vehicle. The accident scene photograph also revealed a curving tire mark which was inferred to have been caused by the Power vehicle after the collision, and scuff marks on the concrete barrier relating to the impact of the vehicle with the barrier. From the evidence available, Mr. Toor was able to make a number of calculations and to perform an accident reconstruction analysis\n",

The likely pre-braking speed of the White vehicle was a minimum of 106 km/h. Thus the engineering analysis contradicts Mr. White's evidence that he was travelling at a speed of about 90 to 95 km/h before the accident occurred\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  The deceleration capability of the White vehicle was significantly reduced by the fact that it was towing an un-braked loaded utility trailer. The trailer on the White vehicle would have likely reduced the braking efficiency of the White vehicle to about 75% of the available friction if no trailer was attached. If the Power vehicle slowed to about 85 to 95 km/h as a result of Mr. Power removing his foot from the accelerator prior to initiating braking, then the Power vehicle began decelerating about 6.2 to 6.8 seconds before impact with the White vehicle. The Power vehicle likely initiated the lane change about 4.4 to 5 seconds prior to impact. The White vehicle did not initiate emergency braking until 2.7 to 3.4 seconds after the lane change was initiated by the Power vehicle\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  The engineering analysis contradicts Mr. White's evidence that the Power vehicle began braking practically simultaneously with the lane change. There was a delay. This is the consistent with Mr. Power's evidence that upon seeing the deer he reacted by initiating a lane change, and commenced braking only when he saw the deer in his path after returning his gaze to the direction of travel.\n",

      "27  Section 144(1) and 162(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 318 are pertinent:\n",

      "144 (1) A person must not drive a motor vehicle on a highway\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  Driving with due care and attention assumes that one must be on the lookout for unexpected manoeuvres by other drivers. The burden imposed upon drivers is reasonably high: Stanowski v. Sammat,  (S.C.) at para. 29, per Madam Justice Kirkpatrick\n",

      "\n",
      "29  According to Mr. White's statement to ICBC given shortly after the accident he saw the deer land on the road in the area in front of Mr. Power. He confirmed the accuracy of that statement in his evidence at trial\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  Once Mr. White saw the deer on the highway, and further, when he observed momentary hesitation by Mr. Power's vehicle, he should have been immediately aware of the need for particular caution. The lane change initiated by Mr. Power vehicle was a predictable reaction on the part of Mr. Power. In my view Mr. White should immediately have begun braking when he saw the deer on the highway and, at the latest, when Mr. Power initiated the lane change, so as to avoid following more closely than was reasonable and prudent, and in case of the need for sudden braking by Mr. Power, as then in fact occurred\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  The engineering analysis of Mr. Toor, which I accept, demonstrates that had Mr. White reacted immediately upon Mr. Power commencing the lane change, or had Mr. White been travelling at no faster than 88.5 km/h, the maximum speed recommended by the U-Haul trailer rental company, the collision would have been avoided. There was also some delay in the initiation of emergency braking by the White vehicle. According to the engineering evidence, an alerted driver will typically perceive and respond in about .7 seconds. The White vehicle did not initiate emergency braking until 2.7 to 3.4 seconds after the lane change was initiated\n",

      "\n",
      "32  The defendant's expert Mr. Harper agreed with all of the calculations and analysis performed by the plaintiff's accident reconstruction expert, Mr. Toor. However, he noted that on the analysis performed by Mr. Toor, Mr. White braked promptly after seeing Mr. Power's brake lights come on. Mr. Toor disagreed with the analysis of Mr. Harper. In any event, as I have said, in my view, Mr. White, being aware of the presence of the deer on or very near the highway, ought to have begun braking as soon as Mr. Power began to make the lane change, if not before, and the collision would thereby have been avoided. As noted the accident also would have been avoided had Mr. White been travelling at a lower speed, as he ought to have, given that he was towing a loaded un-braked trailer. The negligence of the Mr. White led to the collision\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  The word \"negligence\" as used within the phrase \"contributory negligence\" has a different meaning than its use in relation to the conduct of a defendant. Rather than being concerned with a breach of duty to another person, contributory negligence consists of failure of the plaintiff to take reasonable care of himself, thereby contributing to the injury. Therefore the defendant must prove that the plaintiff did not take reasonable care of himself and contributed, by this want of care, to his own injury: Nance v. B.C. Electric Railway Company Ltd.,  at 672 per Viscount Simon; A.M. Linden, B. Feldthusen, Canadian Tort Law, 8th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis, 2006) at 487; J.G. Fleming, The Law of Torts, 9th ed. (Sydney: LBC Information Services, 1998) at 302. To avoid liability in negligence, a person must exercise the standard of care that would be expected of an ordinary, reasonable and prudent person in the same circumstances: Ryan v. Victoria (City),  at para. 28 per Major J\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  The defendant argues, firstly, that the plaintiff should have been able to see the deer well in advance of the 200 feet distance to which he testified. There was no evidence concerning the size or colouring of the deer, or any visual contrast analysis, or any other reliable evidence as to how far away the plaintiff ought to have been able to see the deer in the circumstances. There is no reliable physical evidence as to the position of the deer at any point in time. In my view, the plaintiff may well be mistaken concerning his estimate that he first saw the deer when it was only about 200 feet in front of his vehicle. A speed of 100 km/h corresponds to a speed of 91.13 feet per second. Therefore if the deer was 200 feet in front of Mr. Power's vehicle, the distance between his vehicle and the deer would have been covered in only about two seconds. It would be very difficult for Mr. Power to accurately estimate the distance of the deer when his vehicle was travelling at approximately 100 km/h at the time, and in a situation of a sudden emergency. I conclude that the estimate of 200 feet is not reliable and the actual distance may have been longer\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  The defendant argues, secondly, that Mr. Power should have braked within his lane rather than initiating the lane change into the path of the White vehicle. I accept that Mr. Power had a legitimate concern for the safety of himself and his daughter in seeking to avoid striking the deer. The lane change was a reasonable reaction on his part. As I have concluded that Mr. White ought to have been able to stop in time had he reacted appropriately in response to seeing the deer or in response to or Mr. Power's lane change, then in my view it cannot be said that Mr. Power was negligent in making the lane change\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  In the circumstances the conduct of Mr. Power in initiating the lane change and then suddenly braking in response to the presence of the deer was not a failure to meet the standard of care to which he was required to conform for his own protection in the circumstances. He was entitled to assume that Mr. White would react promptly to the lane change, even if it was suddenly initiated by him, and he was also entitled to assume that Mr. White would be travelling at a speed which would allow him to stop in time to avoid a collision. Therefore I find no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff\n",

Yet this case has some similarity to the decision of Mr. Justice Ruttan in Rossiter v. Cowdery,  (S.C.). In that case Mr. Rossiter was a passenger in his own car being driven by his wife, Mrs. Rossiter. Mrs. Rossiter applied her brakes forcefully in order to avoid striking a dog on the Patricia Bay Highway. The defendant argued that she applied her brakes where it was unsafe to stop, without consideration of others whom she knew would be behind her. However the defendant also had seen the dog on the highway. Ruttan J. held that that the defendant should have been aware of the possibility of the other vehicle stopping, and that Mrs. Rossiter was not motivated merely by compassion for the dog, but was concerned about danger to herself and her passenger, the plaintiff, by the collision with the dog. It was held that there was no liability upon Mrs. Rossiter\n",

      "40  In civil cases, an unfavourable inference can be drawn when in the absence of an explanation a party fails to call a witness who would have knowledge of the facts and would be assumed to be willing to assist that party.

The findings I have made rely primarily upon the evidence of the accident reconstruction engineers. I doubt that Ms. Wheeler's testimony would have made a difference. A passenger in a motor vehicle has no duty to pay attention to the circumstances and it is often the case that a passenger has little useful evidence to give concerning a motor vehicle accident. In this case defence counsel advised me that Ms. Wheeler was not called as a witness simply because she had no useful evidence to give. I accept that explanation.

The house was already old when it was purchased in approximately 1996. It is about 1200 to 1600 square feet in size. After acquiring the house, Mr. Power singlehandedly installed new doors and windows, and replaced the existing shake roof with a steel roof. The pieces of steel for the roof were brought up to the roof by Mr. Power using a ladder. He installed a trout pond and cleared land for lawns and gardens. He installed an above ground swimming pool, constructed outbuildings, and fenced the perimeter of the entire property, consisting of about 1600 lineal feet. He installed by hand, by himself, the approximately 160 fence posts required. He constructed decks, bridges, removed trees and stumps, moved earth first using a bobcat and then using a bulldozer which he acquired. He performed all of the maintenance on the family's two motor vehicles. The house is heated primarily with wood. Mr. Power would obtain a permit to cut wood on public property and cut, split and store the wood himself\n",

      "53  Post accident, Mr. Power has been able to engage only in very limited house and yard work. His discomfort is constant. He must avoid activities that bring on spasm to the torn pectoral muscle. If the muscle contracts and goes into spasm, it can create a lump which he described as a \"good sized orange.\" He then has to attempt to stretch out the muscle. Pain can last for as long as a couple of days afterwards. He continues to suffer from pain in his mid back, spinal area, and in the right size upper shoulder. Pain and discomfort interferes with his sleep. He takes three to five Advil pain tablets per day\n",

      "In review, Mr. Power sustained injuries to his right pectoralis major (partial tear) to the right T-6 area as well as some transient injuries to the soft tissues in his right shoulder and base of neck and right buttock area. These complaints started after his accident and have been persistent and continuous since that time. Institution of physiotherapy, chiropractic and exercised based therapy have been useful in increasing some of his functional capacity since the accident, but have plateaued in that the pain from either his right pectoralis area or the T-6 area have limited any further advancement of intensity or duration of his exercise. These injuries have significantly limited his recreational activities, particularly swimming, biking and running as well as his ability to care for his house and yard, particularly the use of his power saw, shovels and mowing his lawn. At work he generally does not have a lot of limitation as he is able to get up from his seat when he needs to but does have limited sitting capacity as has previously been outlined. He does and would have some problems turning some of the heavy valves and climbing the ladders if there is a breakdown at the mill, however he does have a partner and this has generally worked out that the partner has done this.\n",
      "Mr. Power has sustained significant injuries from the accident. His functional limitations have been outlined in detail. They are significant for his recreational and household and yard activities. At this time I do not see a significant future recovery for these and at the moment I am unable to find a surgeon who would consider repairing this injury, although I will persist in searching the literature for a possible solution for this problem. Mr. Power has shown he is determined to remain active, having returned to work promptly after his accident, followed all of my instructions as well as his therapist's instructions to the letter and done a persistent and significant job in increasing his activities to what is now his limit due to pain in the aforementioned areas and I do not see his disabilities resolving in the near future\n",

      "65  In a report dated August 4, 2008, Dr. Steve Martin, a specialist in sports and occupational medicine, opined that Mr. Power's condition was not going to improve. He should avoid loading of the pectoral muscle whether at work or non work activities. He suffers from a marked reduction in the use of his right upper limb. No treatment is available for his condition other than the use of analgesic medications. With respect to the spasm of Mr. Power's pectoral muscle, which then requires Mr. Powers to release the muscle by stretching, Dr. Martin remarked \"I was able to witness this on a number of occasions in the clinical setting and it was very dramatic\"\n",

The gravity of the injury alone is not determinative. An appreciation of the individual's loss is the key. There is no \"tariff\".

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  In Stapley, the plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident on May 20, 2000. On February 13, 2004 a jury awarded non-pecuniary damages of $275,000. The Court of Appeal reduced the award to $175,000. However, of this amount, $75,000 was on account of what was accepted by the Court of Appeal as Mr. Stapley's \"unique loss\", in that the injury could force the plaintiff to leave his work on a ranch to take employment somewhere else. The Court of Appeal accepted that Mr. Stapley's job on the ranch was of tremendous importance to almost all aspects of his life. It provided Mr. Stapley and his family with their home, community, and lifestyle. He was a long term resident of the ranch, at nominal rent, and had freedom to use the ranch and extensive facilities and thousands of acres of land. If he lost his job on the ranch, his family would be forced to leave their home and lose their unique ranch lifestyle, sense of community, the ranch's wide open spaces and \"8,000 acre back yard\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "72  The motor vehicle accident resulted in a thoracic outlet syndrome injury which required surgery which afforded considerable improvement, but Mr. Stapley was left with permanent partial disability. Nonetheless he was able to continue his work as a mechanic on the ranch and continued to engage in numerous recreational pursuits such as slow pitch softball, curling, ice hockey, bucking of firewood, fishing, golfing, and hunting; however all of these activities were on a limited basis and with pain\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "73  The Court of Appeal stated:\n",
      "[31] However, the unique and central loss to Mr. Stapley is the potential loss of his employment on the ranch and concomitant loss of the lifestyle that living on the ranch provides.\n",
      "...\n",
      "[107] It must be recognized that the jury accepted that Mr. Stapley would lose the lifestyle afforded to him by reason of his employment on the ranch. However, that is only one component of his non-pecuniary award, albeit a significant one. It must also be recognized that Mr. Stapley continues to work and is capable of supporting his family, a matter that means much to him. Furthermore, he is able to enjoy recreational pursuits and is not, as with some other plaintiffs referred to above, incapacitated in that regard.\n",
      "...\n",
      "[109] I accept that the $100,000 non-pecuniary damage award made in Munro v. Faircrest represents the high end of conventional awards for a somewhat similarly situated plaintiff. However, as I have noted, Mr. Stapley's unique loss deserves to be compensated. ...\n",
      "[110] In other words, Mr. Stapley is able to work, support his family, and participate in recreational activities. The chronic pain he experiences has not and, according to the medical evidence, will not in the future preclude those activities. In ordinary circumstances, an award of non-pecuniary damages for those losses would not exceed $100,000.\n",
      "[111] What, then, is reasonable compensation for the additional potential loss of lifestyle? In my opinion, it cannot reasonably exceed an additional $75,000...\n",
      "[112] In my view, based on the evidence before the jury and having particular deference to the jury's assessment of Mr. Stapley's loss, a reasonable award for non-pecuniary damages at the highest level would be $175,000\n",
      "======\n",

      "74  Stapley is a somewhat difficult precedent to apply. Firstly, much of the discussion and a substantial portion of the award itself related to the \"unique loss\" suffered by the plaintiff, in that case.

Her health was good. She was physically active and enjoyed skiing, running, biking, hiking, tennis and exercise. She lived alone. Prior to the accident she was energetic, optimistic, buoyant, extroverted and accomplished. By the time of trial she continued to suffer from constant headaches, neck pain, back spasms and pain, with associated pain in the ribs and numbness and weakness in her forearms and hands. She could not tolerate prolonged sitting or exercise. She could not sleep for more than about an hour. Her physical activities were significantly reduced. She no longer skied or ran or hiked for more than 90 minutes. Her work and volunteer activities were negatively affected. Non-pecuniary damages of $100,000 were awarded.

Mr. Justice Smart summarized by saying:\n",

It is difficult to determine the extent of the impact given the nature of her health issues and given the concerns with respect to her credibility that I have already discussed.

He was left with permanent stiffness of his shoulder with fatigue and weakness. There was some risk that future shoulder replacement surgery would be required. He had been a very active retiree pre-accident. His activities were significantly curtailed following the accident. Before the accident he did most of the inside housework and all of the outside housework at his large single family home. He assisted his mother in taking care of a number of rental properties. At his wife's urging, following the accident, the couple sold their house and moved into a townhouse because the plaintiff could no longer maintain the property. The couple hired a housekeeper\n",

His ability to improve and maintain his property, quite obviously a source of great pleasure and pride to him formerly, is all but completely gone. He has not and will not in future be as physically fit as he previously was. It is reasonable to infer that this may affect his health long term.

If the plaintiff discharges that burden of proof, then depending upon the facts of the case, the plaintiff may prove the quantification of that loss of earning capacity, either on an earnings approach, as in Steenblok, , or a capital asset approach, as in Brown, . The former approach will be more useful when the loss is more easily measurable, as it was in Steenblok. The latter approach will be more useful when the loss is not as easily measurable, as in Pallos, , and Romanchych.

The basis of the claim is a report of a rehabilitation consultant, Ms. Nancy Head, dated March 19, 2010. Ms. Head calculated the costs that Mr. Power will incur in future as a result of his injuries. The bulk of the costs relate to home, yard and motor vehicle maintenance. An economist's report, based upon the report of Ms. Head, summarizes the claim as follows:\n",
      "Treatment and therapy: $13,337 plus (negligible) applicable taxes;\n",
      "Vehicle maintenance and repairs: $41,370 plus applicable taxes;\n",
      "Home and yard maintenance: $130,389 plus applicable taxes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "108  The claim is based upon an assumption that all of the costs commence this year\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "109  Home and yard maintenance is comprised of expenses at market rates for work that the plaintiff would otherwise be capable of doing, such as firewood splitting and stacking, power washing, cleaning of exterior windows, cleaning and maintenance of gutters, repairs and maintenance to fascia boards, fence maintenance, gardening, lawn mowing, mower maintenance, tree pruning, raking, watering, snow removal, repair of a bulldozer, and maintenance of the swimming pool\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "110  So far, in the nearly four years post accident, very little of the household expense has been incurred. By nature Mr. Power is not a person who wishes to hire people to do work that he feels he should be able to do, or that he and his wife should be able to do. There has been some friction between him and Mrs. Power over the topic. She has recently insisted on hiring someone to do interior painting, at a cost of approximately $2,300. Much of the rest of the work has either been gone undone, or been done by Mr. Power, slowly, and with difficulty. For example he has continued to mow the lawns, albeit it slowly. He has obtained firewood with the assistance of his brother\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "111  The defence argues that the plaintiff's submissions take no account of the plaintiff's duty or ability to mitigate, and no consideration of contingencies. The defence argues that in the lengthy period of time since the motor vehicle accident very little of the claimed forecast expenditures have in fact been incurred. The defence argues that the court is to make an assessment of loss, not a calculation. The defence argues that an appropriate award for future care costs would be $50,000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "112  In my view the proper approach in this case is to evaluate the plaintiff's loss as partly as a cost of care, in relation to future care costs such as chiropractic treatment or medications, and partly as a loss of capacity to perform household services. Mr. Power has undoubtedly lost significant capacity to perform household services, which is an asset of real economic value. It was especially valuable to him given the extraordinarily high amount of house and garden maintenance required on the property owned by Mr. and Mrs. Power, and Mr. Power's ability and inclination to personally do so much of the work. The result of Mr. Power's incapacity, over the past four years, has largely been that the condition of the property has deteriorated. There has been little out of pocket loss. Mr. Power has also lost much of the satisfaction that he formerly derived by maintaining the property to a high standard through his own efforts. That loss has already been reflected in the non-pecuniary award. Mr. Power continues to have some capacity to perform household tasks. It may be that Mr. and Mrs. Power will be forced to conclude that they need to move to another residence which does not require the same high level of effort as does their present residence. In that case the potential expenses would be substantially reduced. Even without the accident injuries, other health setbacks or lifestyle changes may in any event have rendered Mr. Power unable or unwilling to carry out the full range of household services he has done in the past\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "113  In my view the sum of $80,000 represents a reasonable assessment of the lost capacity to perform household services, not including vehicle maintenance\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "114  The sum of $41,370 plus tax is claimed in respect of the value of Mr. Power's maintenance of the family's two vehicles, based upon an annual expenditure of $2,473.63 from 2010 to the end of Mr. Power's life. However, there are negative contingencies to be considered. At some point Mr. and Mrs. Power may no longer need two vehicles, for example if one or both of them retires. Again, other circumstances may in any event have rendered Mr. Power unable or unwilling to continue doing his own motor vehicle maintenance and repair. In my view $20,000 is reasonable compensation for this loss\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "115  The plaintiff claims $13,337 plus applicable sales taxes (which were minimal) for future treatments such as chiropractic treatments, medical equipment and supplies, and over the counter medication, such as Advil. These claims are reasonable and were not really contested by the defence. $15,000 will be allowed in relation to this claim\n",
      "======\n",

He observed a pick-up truck stopped in the road. He stopped momentarily and then drove past the truck on the right side. In so doing, he drove into a group of young people and the driver of the pick-up truck who were standing between the right side of the truck and the south curb of the roadway\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "2  At trial, the five actions of the five plaintiffs injured by Mr. McWilliams were heard at the same time. The sole issue in dispute is liability. The issue of damages was severed by the order of Master Doolan on December 13, 2001.\n",

      "3  The plaintiffs, Sean Holmes, Derek Moran, Eric Tremblay, and Brook Hafiz, were the young people struck down by the 1982 grey Chevette car owned and driven by the defendant, Harry McWilliams\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "4  The plaintiff, Darin Laface, was the driver of a Ford pick-up truck. His wife, Michelle Laface (née Nolt), owned the truck jointly with her husband. She and Mr. Laface are named as defendants in the actions brought by the four young plaintiffs. Those plaintiffs allege that the Laface truck was improperly parked on the roadway and caused the McWilliams car to swerve and strike the pedestrians\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "5  All of the plaintiffs claim that Mr. McWilliams was negligent in colliding with them and causing injury and damage. The plaintiffs also all claim against the defendants, Boknows Hotels Inc. and Steveston Investments Ltd., which carry on business as the Steveston Hotel and Third Avenue Pub (the \"pub,\" or the \"Steveston Hotel,\" or the \"hotel\"). The claims against the hotel allege, among other things, failure to comply with a commercial host's responsibility to monitor Mr. McWilliams' consumption of alcohol and to ensure that he got home safely\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "6  The plaintiff, Darin Laface, joined as defendants in his action those pedestrians who are plaintiffs (Messrs. Holmes, Moran, Tremblay and Hafiz) and others for their alleged contribution to the accident. Mr. Laface discontinued the claims against Adam Purdie, Christina Frame, Jennifer Farrow and Cristina Valdes. No appearances were filed by Aliesha Deleon and Tyler Fast. At the conclusion of the trial, counsel for Mr. Laface (as plaintiff) advised that, having considered all of the evidence and the argument on the issue of proximate cause addressed by Mr. Laface's defence counsel, the claims against the pedestrians would not be pursued\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "7  The Steveston Hotel denies that it was negligent in its service to Mr. McWilliams. The hotel says that the accident was caused or contributed to by Mr. Laface and Mr. McWilliams and that the plaintiffs contributed to their injuries by leaving a position of safety and moving to, or remaining in, the path of Mr. McWilliams' car\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "8  The Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (\"ICBC\") filed a Third Party Notice. The statement of defence of ICBC denied the fault or negligence of Mr. McWilliams. In the alternative, ICBC alleged that the plaintiffs caused or contributed to their loss by their own negligence in leaving the curb, failing to observe approaching traffic, failing to take reasonable steps to remove themselves from the highway, and failing to avoid the collision when they knew or ought to have known it was imminent\n",
      "======\n",

The hotel pleads that Ms. Strang caused or contributed to the accident by negligently stopping behind the pick-up truck, thereby creating an obstruction that funnelled the McWilliams car into the pedestrians; by failing to activate the hazard lights; and by creating a hazard. The hotel further claims that Ms. Valdes caused or contributed to the accident by allowing Ms. Strang to operate her car while her ability to do so was impaired by fatigue or other conditions affecting her mental capacity; by failing to direct Ms. Strang to not stop behind the truck; and by failing to demand that Ms. Strang activate the car's hazard lights.\n",

      "\n",
      "12  The evening of Friday, June 11, was warm and dry. It was a weekend close to high school graduation and many young people were socializing, as young people are wont to do, in parks in the vicinity of the accident scene at Chatham Street and First Avenue in Steveston\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "13  Chatham Street runs east and west. It is divided into two lanes with a continuous yellow line dividing the east and west lanes. Parking is permitted in the curb lanes which are not marked on the roadway. First Avenue is a narrower road that intersects with Chatham Street. South of Chatham Street, it is a one-way street running north, and it becomes a two-way street north of Chatham. Accordingly, vehicles travelling east on Chatham Street are not permitted to turn right onto First Avenue. However, it appears from the photographs in evidence that eastbound traffic on Chatham Street is permitted to turn left (or north) onto First Avenue\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "14  Among the young people who were partying that night was the plaintiff, Sean Holmes. His 19th birthday was on June 13, 1999. His friend, the plaintiff, Derek Moran, was 18 at the time. On June 11, Mr. Moran was driven by his father to the home where Mr. Holmes lived with his parents, located near the intersection of Chatham Street and First Avenue. Mr. Moran and Mr. Holmes went to the beer and wine store at the Steveston Hotel. Mr. Moran purchased two six-packs of beer using false identification he had obtained for the purpose of purchasing cigarettes. They each drank a beer at Mr. Holmes' apartment and then, at about 8:30 p.m., went to a local arcade with the plaintiff, Brook Hafiz, and another young man, Tyler Fast. At the arcade they heard of a gathering in Sherwood Park\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "15  The group went to Sherwood Park. The estimates of the number of people there varied, but it was somewhere between 20 and 40. Also among the group were the plaintiff, Eric Tremblay, and later in the evening the third parties, Robyn Strang and Cristina Valdes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  Mr. Holmes remembered drinking five cans of regular beer between 9:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. Mr. Moran told the police on June 15, 1999, that he had consumed eight beers that evening, although he testified at trial that he in fact had consumed fewer than eight beers. Mr. Hafiz testified that he consumed a six-pack of beer that evening, but had stopped drinking four or five hours before the time of the collision (in other words, between 8:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Mr. Tremblay, who was very seriously injured, has no memory of the events in question. However, Mr. Tremblay's serum alcohol concentration, as determined by the Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine at Vancouver General Hospital, was 39 mmol/l of alcohol. Dr. Carolyn Kirkwood estimated that, assuming the pathology report was accurate, Mr. Tremblay's blood alcohol concentration was 162 mg. of alcohol in 100 ml. of blood. Based on further assumptions, Dr. Kirkwood estimated Mr. Tremblay's blood alcohol level at 1:26 a.m. on June 12, 1999, to be 176 mg. of alcohol in 100 ml. of blood. It appears that Mr. Tremblay drank the equivalent of about eight cans of beer on the evening in question\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  Mr. Holmes and his friends spent most of the evening in the park, in his words, \"goofing around\" and \"hanging out.\" At some point, Mr. Holmes and others decided to go to the Steveston pool to swim. The pool was closed, but Mr. Holmes said every year they would sneak in at night and go swimming\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  By this time, Mr. Hafiz had already left the park to return a bicycle and hat belonging to a friend named Jeff. He had stumbled over the bicycle on his way out of the park and intended to return the articles to his friend's home. As he was leaving the park, he was confronted by a police officer who asked what he was doing. The officer told him to give his friends a warning that the police were there and that they were to get out of the pool. Mr. Hafiz obliged\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  Shortly thereafter, the police advised Mr. Holmes that it was time to leave the pool. Mr. Holmes left the pool and walked down Chatham Street. Mr. Moran was with Mr. Holmes at the pool and was there when the police arrived. He took Mr. Holmes' jacket and keys and followed Mr. Holmes down the south side of Chatham Street\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "20  In the meantime, Mr. Hafiz returned the bicycle and hat to the home of his friend, Jeff. He checked on Jeff because he was concerned his friend was ill from alcohol poisoning. He then walked the short distance to Chatham Street and First Avenue. He remembered seeing a Mustang \"do a doughnut\" on Chatham Street. He saw a group of 15 to 25 people gathered on the southwest corner of Chatham Street and First Avenue. He decided to join them. Among those gathered at the corner were Mr. Moran and Mr. Holmes. Mr. Moran recalled talking with Mr. Hafiz and his good friend, Tyler Fast\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "21  Earlier that evening, Darin Laface had completed his shift as manager at a local restaurant at 9:15 p.m. He ate dinner at the restaurant. He did not consume alcohol. He then went home at about 9:45 p.m. His home is located on Chatham Street west of First Avenue. When he arrived home, Mr. Laface watched the end of a taped basketball game. His wife, the defendant, Michelle Laface, was scheduled to work the next day. She went to bed shortly before Mr. Laface left the apartment at 10:30 p.m. to walk to the pub at the Steveston Hotel. He expected that he might meet up there with co-workers from the restaurant. At the pub, Mr. Laface ordered a pint of beer and played video golf for about an hour and a half. His co-workers arrived and he sat with them and ordered a further glass of beer\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "22  Eventually, Mr. Laface offered one of his co-workers, Linton Novac, a ride home. They left the pub at approximately 1:10 or 1:15 a.m. They walked the short distance to Mr. Laface's apartment and got into his Ford pick-up truck. Mr. Laface drove down the lane, turned right onto Chatham Street and proceeded eastbound. He noticed a crowd of young people standing on the south sidewalk and in the south parking lane of Chatham Street. The area was well lit by three lamp posts on the south side of the street and by a nearby bus stop. The crowd was very noisy. He estimated it to consist of about 15 people. Mr. Laface was concerned that the noise would prevent his wife from sleeping\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "23  Mr. Laface stopped his truck adjacent to the crowd on the southwest corner of Chatham Street and First Avenue. He asked his passenger, Mr. Novac, to roll down the passenger side window. He then spoke to the crowd and asked them to, in effect, \"take their party elsewhere\" and explained that his wife was sleeping and had to get up in the morning. He then drove on\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  As Mr. Laface drove away from the crowd, he saw in his rear-view mirror a member of the crowd throw a beer can at his truck. He testified that he did not hear it strike his truck. He stopped his truck and then put it in reverse. He backed up as close as he could to the curb, mindful that he did not want to hit any of the young people on the road. He stopped his truck a few feet west of that point on the road where the yellow centre line is interrupted, indicating that it is permissible for traffic to turn left. Mr. Laface estimated that the truck was seven to eight feet from the curb and six to seven feet from the centre line of the road\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "25  Mr. Laface testified that he put his truck in park, activated the hazard lights, and got out of the truck. He said he went to the rear of the truck to see if the beer can had struck the truck. He said he wanted to know who had thrown the beer can and why, and, in his words, \"to just get these kids out of there.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  Both Mr. Laface and Mr. Holmes recall speaking with one another at the scene. They were neighbours and on friendly terms. Mr. Holmes recalled initially walking to the driver's side window of the truck and suggesting to Mr. Laface that he not get out of the truck because it was a potentially ugly situation. Mr. Holmes testified that Mr. Laface's passenger was antagonizing the crowd\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  Mr. Laface said that after he got out of the truck he spoke with Mr. Holmes as he stood on the passenger side of the truck, near the door. He was facing south and Mr. Holmes was facing north. Mr. Laface did not see any cars approaching. He said that there were youths \"all over the place,\" some on the sidewalk and some near his truck. He assumed that no one would pass on the right side of his truck because a driver would see the people between his truck and the curb\n",
      "======\n",

      "28  Alexandra Poehlke was among the group of young people who had gathered at Chatham Street and First Avenue. She described \"a lot of people\" and estimated the number to be between 20 and 40. She was standing on the sidewalk adjacent to Mr. Laface's truck. She saw Mr. Laface and his passenger get out of the truck. She said that they were very aggressive and wanted an explanation. She thought that a fight was about to break out. She believed Mr. Holmes, Mr. Tremblay and Mr. Hafiz were attempting to prevent a fight from occurring\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  Ms. Poehlke testified that she noticed traffic building up behind the pick-up truck. She saw two cars behind the truck. She said that the second car, which had a clear view of the people and had its headlights on, moved into the parking lane, stopped for a second, and then drove through the crowd of people on the road. This second car was the grey Chevette driven by Mr. McWilliams. Ms. Poehlke testified under cross-examination by counsel for the hotel that she was certain that she observed the second car stop and wait. She remembered that fact because she was relieved to see the car stop. It was her impression that the driver drove intentionally into the group because she believed that he could see the pedestrians on the road\n",

The next thing Mr. Hafiz knew, he was on the ground\n",

      "31  The first car behind Mr. Laface's truck was the red Mazda 323 owned by Ms. Valdes and driven by Ms. Strang, who was 17 at the time and did not have a driver's licence. However, she had driven Ms. Valdes' car on previous occasions. She had learned to drive the year before while living with her aunt and uncle in Comox, B.C. Ms. Strang had consumed three cans of beer (or two cans of beer and a cooler) over the course of the evening. Ms. Valdes had also been drinking. She did not want to drive because she considers herself to be a poor driver and because she had been drinking. She believed Ms. Strang was, in her words, \"fine to drive.\n",

      "32  Ms. Strang and Ms. Valdes were at Sherwood Park with the other young people early in the evening. At some point they received a page to meet someone at the Steveston Hotel. Ms. Strang drove the short distance to the pub. They encountered people Ms. Strang knew in the parking lot. Ms. Strang testified that, while she was talking with these people, the following occurred:\n",
      " A.:  ... And then, all of a sudden, we heard this bang and it was, like, the bang of a door opening, and there was a guy. Like, it looked like he was either being thrown out or he fell out the door, of the back door of - in the parking lot, of the Buck. And then we all looked over and this person started stumbling, like, one, two, three this way, one, two, three that way towards us, and about halfway towards me, I looked and I said, \"Harry?\" Because I had known him for a couple of months before that. And he didn't know who I was, so he kept stumbling over to me until he actually had to put his hands on my shoulder and be that far away to know who I was. \n",
      " Q.:  When you say \"that far away,\" you are indicating face to face; is that right? \n",
      " A.:  Face to face. Like, right in front of me. And he was, like, \"oh, Robyn,\" but slurred. \n",
      " Q.: Now, what did you notice about him at that time? \n",
      " A.: That he was really, really, really drunk.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "33  Ms. Strang had known Mr. McWilliams for a few months. She asked him what he was doing. He said he was leaving. She asked him if he planned to drive, to which he responded that he was. Ms. Strang believed that he was not physically able to drive a car. She tried to persuade him to allow her to drive him home. He refused. She attempted unsuccessfully to grab his keys. She eventually persuaded him to go back into the pub to locate one of his friends to drive his car home for him\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  They walked to the front entrance of the pub. The doorman refused them entry because the last call for drinks had already been made. Ms. Strang informed the doorman that Mr. McWilliams was drunk and that she wanted to find somebody to drive his car for him. The doorman allowed them into the pub\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  Once inside, Ms. Strang took Mr. McWilliams to that area of the pub where their friends were. She left him for a minute or two to speak with her friends. She then walked over to Mr. McWilliams and asked him if he had found anyone to drive his car. He said that he had not. Ms. Strang testified that she was frustrated. She said she yelled \"at the top of her lungs\": \"Is anyone going to help me find someone to drive his car for him?\" She said that people looked at her and then looked away. No one offered to help her. She walked out of the pub\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  Ms. Strang returned to the parking lot. Ms. Valdes was there. Ms. Strang saw Mr. McWilliams leave the pub with Sheldon Reid. Mr. Reid, by his own account, was drunk. He had consumed eight pints of beer while at the pub and three beers before going to the pub. Ms. Strang asked Mr. Reid why he was getting into Mr. McWilliams' car. Mr. Reid said that Mr. McWilliams \"knew his limit.\" Also with Mr. McWilliams was Phil Bodenhimer. Ms. Strang confronted him, saying \"What kind of friend are you to get in the car with him?\" His response was not noted. However, all of Ms. Strang's efforts to persuade others to intervene to prevent Mr. McWilliams from driving failed\n",

She put her foot on the brake. She stopped about a car length's distance behind the pick-up truck. She looked over and saw people on the side of the road, including Ms. Valdes' sister, Maria.

      "38  Ms. Strang's sense was that Mr. McWilliams' car was always in motion. She did not recall it stopping. She did not see its headlights. She remembered the car passing to her right at about 60 kph\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",

      "40  Ms. Valdes has a different recollection of the manner in which Mr. McWilliams drove past her car. She does not remember leaving the parking lot of the Steveston Hotel. Nor does she remember seeing a truck stopped in the road. She remembers calling out to her sister, who was on the south side of Chatham Street. She thinks that Ms. Strang drove the car towards the curb, at which time she called out to her sister. Ms. Valdes' focus at that moment was on her sister. She testified that a car passed on the left of her car. She does not remember that car then swerving to the right\n",
      "======\n",

      "41  Significantly, Ms. Valdes testified that it was not possible to travel further east on Chatham Street on the right side of her car because there were people on the street\n",

      "42  Mr. McWilliams testified at his examination for discovery that he stopped behind the Laface truck and then went around it on the right. He did not see the pedestrians before he hit them\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "43  Mrs. Laface testified that she fell asleep after her husband left that evening to go to the pub. She was awakened by the sound of a car \"doing doughnuts\" on Chatham Street. She was unable to go back to sleep. She heard people, in her words, \"yelling, screaming, and partying.\" She then heard a vehicle accelerate and then a \"thud.\" Following that, she heard screams of panic. She looked out her bedroom window. She saw people standing by a body underneath a lamp post. She telephoned 911. She then returned to the window. She observed a truck with flashing hazard lights and more bodies. She dressed and went outside. She walked behind the truck and realized it was the pick-up truck she and her husband owned. She called out her husband's name. She could not find him\n",

      "\n",
      "44  When Mr. McWilliams drove through the crowd in the parking lane of Chatham Street, he hit Mr. Holmes, Mr. Hafiz, Mr. Moran and Mr. Tremblay, all of whom were strewn about the roadway. He also hit Mr. Laface, who was thrown up onto the hood and through the front windshield of Mr. McWilliams' Chevette. Mr. McWilliams was not aware that he had hit anyone until his car came to a stop and he saw that Mr. Laface's head had crashed through the windshield\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "45  Mr. McWilliams' car came to a stop further east on Chatham Street when he crossed the westbound lane of traffic and drove up over a curb. Constable Mund was the first police officer at the scene. When she encountered Mr. McWilliams, she noted a strong odour of alcohol emanating from him. He appeared slow and sluggish. He needed guidance to the police car. Constable Mund arrested him for driving while impaired. She took him to the R.C.M.P. detachment and led him to the telephone room so he could call a lawyer. However, Constable Mund was forced to place the telephone call for Mr. McWilliams because he was incapable of dialling. During the time that Constable Mund observed Mr. McWilliams, she also noted that he staggered, had slurred speech, was unaware of his surroundings, tipped back and forth, and that his head flopped back and forth\n",

      "46  Constable Prihar is qualified as a technician to operate the BAC Datamaster C breath instrument. Mr. McWilliams provided two breath samples: the first, taken at 2:40 a.m. on June 12, 1999, registered 180 mg. of alcohol in 100 ml. of blood; the second, taken at 2:58 a.m. on June 12, 1999, showed 170 mg. of alcohol in 100 ml. of blood. Both samples showed blood alcohol levels more than twice the legal limit.\n",
      "SPECIFIC FINDINGS OF FACT CONCERNING THE COLLISIO\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "47  I make the following findings of fact concerning the collision:\n",
      "There can be no doubt that Mr. McWilliams was grossly impaired on June 12, 1999. That fact is amply proven by the evidence of the police constables who dealt with him, the certificate of blood alcohol analysis, and the evidence of Robyn Strang, Cristina Valdes and others who observed him at the Steveston Hotel. Another witness, Alexander Laite (who had not been drinking alcohol), was also in the Steveston Hotel parking lot that evening. He observed Mr. McWilliams staggering across the parking lot. He saw Mr. McWilliams put his right hand on a wall to steady himself.\n",
      "I find that it is more probable than not that Mr. McWilliams stopped his car momentarily behind the Valdes vehicle. I also find that he accelerated past the Valdes vehicle on the right hand side and not, as some witnesses suggested, on the left of the Valdes vehicle. I make this finding based on the clear recollection of Ms. Strang, as well as the improbability that Mr. McWilliams in his drunken state would have been capable of manoeuvring his car in slalom-like fashion between Ms. Valdes' car and the Laface truck.\n",
      "I find that the Laface pick-up truck did not create a visual obstruction to the existence of the large crowd of people at the intersection of Chatham Street and First Avenue. As the photographs in evidence demonstrate, Chatham Street is a broad, straight roadway. The area was well lit. It is clear that Mr. McWilliams' car stopped about three or four car lengths behind the area on the road where the crowd had congregated. As pick-up trucks go, the Laface truck was relatively small. It was not equipped with a canopy or other equipment. The box appears to have been empty. This distinguishes this case from the decision relied upon by the Steveston Hotel: McDowell (Guardian ad Litem of) v. Barry,  (S.C.). In McDowell, the defendant was found contributorily at fault for an accident because his truck, which had an hydraulic arm mounted on the back, was found to be a \"large obstruction.\" The Laface truck was not such an obstruction.\n",
      "I find that Mr. McWilliams stopped his car because he saw the truck ahead of him. Mr. McWilliams did not testify at trial. However, portions of his examination for discovery were read into evidence at trial. Mr. McWilliams said that he saw the pick-up truck from about one-half block away. He confirmed that he came to a stop behind the truck before deciding to attempt to pass the truck on the right. Mr. McWilliams said that he did not see anybody before he hit them. However, I find that, had he been keeping a proper look-out, Mr. McWilliams would have seen the throng of young people at the side of the road and on the road as he approached the intersection of First Avenue and Chatham Street. Perhaps the best evidence of the ability to see the crowd from a similar (although arguably more difficult) vantage point came from Ms. Strang. She saw the pedestrians. Indeed, one of her reasons for stopping, apart from the presence of the pick-up truck, was her interest in learning why the crowd was on the road.\n",
      "CIRCUMSTANCES CONCERNING THE STEVESTON HOTE\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  As I have noted earlier, a central issue in this case is the conduct of the hotel and its employees in the service and supervision of the pub's patrons, including Mr. McWilliams\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "49  Robert Grant has been involved in the management of the Steveston Hotel since his family purchased it in 1979. He has held the controlling interest in the business since 1992\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "50  Mr. Grant testified in chief as to his views on the service of alcohol. He claimed that he did not believe in serving alcohol to intoxicated persons. He said he was concerned about people drinking and driving. He said that he personally monitored service in the pub and would make surprise visits. He was at the hotel between 40 and 60 hours each week. He also hired private investigators to monitor the staff's performance. He installed video cameras around the pub, chiefly to monitor whether the staff were depositing money. He testified that he expected his staff to follow the guidelines of the Serving It Right course that bartenders and servers in licensed premises are required to take\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "51  Under cross-examination, Mr. Grant agreed that he had no tolerance for intoxicated persons on his premises. He agreed that he conveyed his \"zero tolerance\" policy to his managers and staff. He agreed that he also had no tolerance for under-aged patrons on the premises, or for admitting them onto the premises. He trusted his staff to deal with intoxicated persons in accordance with the Serving It Right guidelines. He acknowledged the importance of ensuring that intoxicated persons get home safely so that they are not a danger to themselves or others. He agreed that the responsibility lies with the licensed establishment to see that people get home safely. He said, \"The onus is on me.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "52  That acknowledgement is contrary to a continuing theme in the hotel's cross-examination of all of the witnesses who were patrons of the pub on June 11 and 12, 1999. The cross-examination clearly suggested that the responsibility to ensure that patrons get home safely lay with the patrons of the pub and not the pub itself\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "53  Mr. Grant initially denied that Mr. McWilliams was in the pub on June 11 or 12, 1999. He then said, as he did in response to numerous questions, that \"it was possible.\" He was vague in stating when he first learned of the incident (at one point he responded with \"What incident?\"). He first suggested that he learned about the accident when a Richmond newspaper reported it in the week following June 12. He then stated that he knew something about it before that time. The hotel manager who was on duty the night of the accident, David Kristjanson, came upon the accident scene as he left work that night. He said he spoke to two staff members who were at the accident scene and who were also present in the pub that night, Tim Derrick and Dwayne Potenteau. Mr. Kristjanson agreed that he was concerned that a patron from the pub might have been involved in the accident. Yet Mr. Grant claims that he did not discuss the matter with Mr. Kristjanson\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "54  Mr. Kristjanson has been employed by the Steveston Hotel since 1992. He was in charge of the hotel, the pub, and the beer and wine store on June 11 and 12, 1999. Mr. Grant and Matthew King, the food and beverage manager, were not there. Mr. Kristjanson testified that on the evening in question there were three bartenders and three servers on shift, all of whom had Serving It Right certification. He confirmed that all staff were instructed to follow those guidelines. The pub has a 234-seat capacity. On the night in question, it was operating at about 75 percent capacity\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "55  Mr. Kristjanson also confirmed that alcohol consumption by staff while they were on duty was strictly forbidden. He stated that if staff drank on shift they would be fired because it was contrary to hotel policy and the pub's liquor license\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "56  Mr. Kristjanson recalled nothing unusual about the evening of June 11 and 12, 1999. He said it was \"a good night with no problems.\" As I have noted, he came upon the accident scene as he left work that night. He said that he heard that someone was driving drunk and had hit some people. He said that he had thought back over the evening to see if he could recall a problem patron, but could not\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "57  Mr. Kristjanson said that he did not hear Robyn Strang's shouted words, \"Is anyone going to help me ... ?\" He said that if it had happened, he would have been aware of it. However, Mr. Kristjanson conceded that as the night wears on, the noise volume in the pub increases\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "58  Mr. Kristjanson was responsible for the three doormen on duty whose job it was to check identification and to keep problem patrons out of the pub. At the time, the pub hired doormen from a company called Flash Security. The doormen were under the control of either the hotel manager or a bartender at all times\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "59  Mr. Kristjanson agreed with the proposition that an establishment that serves alcohol must be ever-vigilant. He agreed that this is the reason staff were certified under the Serving It Right program\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "60  Mr. Kristjanson adopted several portions of the Serving It Right manual put to him in cross-examination, including:\n",
      "WHAT IS DUTY OF CARE?\n",
      "One of the most important features of the Occupier's Liability Act is the principle of \"duty of care\". It requires that people take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions that might have been reasonably foreseen to injure their neighbours. In the context of alcohol sale and service it means that the licensee must protect patrons and others from harm that may be associated with the activity of drinking. The duty of care can be divided into two general categories:\n",
      "...\n",
      "The duty owed when patrons leave the premises as related to the:\n",
      "injury to patrons (e.g., patrons leave and injuring themselves)\n",
      "injury to third parties (e.g., patrons leave and cause injury to others)\n",
      "Duty of care extends off the premises\n",
      "The duty owed to patrons also extends to when the patron leaves the establishment. This issue most often arises when a motor vehicle accident is the result, at least in part, of someone's overindulgence.\n",
      "Ensure you meet your duty of care\n",
      "A good reason for maintaining a controlled environment is to ensure you meet all legal duty of care responsibilities. In summary they are to:\n",
      "Serve only patrons legally old enough to drink\n",
      "Serve no one to the point of intoxication\n",
      "Refuse entry to intoxicated people\n",
      "Remove intoxicated people from the premises responsibly\n",
      "Control the environment in the establishment\n",
      "Foresee the safety of the patrons on and off the premises\n",
      "Foresee the safety of the patrons through the actions of your employees and the actions of third partie\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "61  Mr. Kristjanson also agreed that doormen or bouncers are the \"first line of defence\" in the pub's duty to be ever-vigilant for intoxicated or under-aged persons trying to gain entry to the pub. He agreed that doormen are called upon to monitor the sobriety of patrons when they leave, particularly if they leave by the back door of the pub that opens onto the hotel parking lot. He conceded the obvious: a patron who goes to the parking lot may then drive away. Yet he had no recollection of instructing the doormen in this regard\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "62  Mr. Kristjanson further conceded that if a patron leaves the pub staggering, the doorman should take steps to make sure that the person does not get behind the wheel of a car. He agreed that in that sense, the doormen are also the \"last line of defence\" in ensuring \"ever-vigilance\" for problem patrons or risks of harm\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  Mr. Kristjanson agreed that it is important for servers to observe the pace of speech and to look for slurred speech of patrons. As the noise volume in the pub increases, servers routinely use hand signals for orders which, of course, eliminates the opportunity to examine a patron's speech\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  Mr. Kristjanson also agreed that red, bloodshot eyes are another indicia of impairment. When the lights are dimmed, such indicia are difficult to discern from a distance of seven to eight feet. Mr. Kristjanson said servers would be at a closer distance, but conceded that it would be more difficult to make those observations as people were milling about the pub\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "65  Lastly, Mr. Kristjanson acknowledged the importance of counting a patron's drinks as a method of control. As I have noted, the pub had a 234-seat capacity and on June 11, 1999 it was at about 75 percent capacity. The three servers were each responsible for about 65 patrons in each section of the pub. In a pub in which there are no restrictions on a person's ability to move about, Mr. Kristjanson conceded that it is difficult to keep count of the number of drinks served to a particular patron. The only feasible way to monitor the consumption of drinks in those circumstances is if servers talk to one another at the cash area and alert one another to the patrons in their respective sections\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "66  Mr. Kristjanson, both at his examination for discovery and at trial, stated that in June 1999 the hotel did not have a written serving policy governing hotel staff. Instead, the hotel relied on the Serving It Right program. He agreed that the standard set out in that program was the standard applicable to the hotel in June 1999\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "67  Mr. Kristjanson agreed that the Steveston Hotel had a number of responsibilities: to prevent minors from getting into the pub; to not serve someone who was intoxicated; to not permit someone to become intoxicated; to keep track of patrons' alcohol consumption; and to continuously monitor customers' behaviour for signs of intoxication. He agreed that there is a serious risk that an over-served customer will drive a motor vehicle away from the pub and cause a motor vehicle accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  A most troubling aspect of this trial concerns the disclosure during Mr. Grant's evidence that he had, two or three times a year, hired a private investigator to check on the staff who had produced written reports. Those reports were not produced during discovery. When their existence was disclosed at trial, I ordered production of them forthwith to all counsel. I ruled that counsel for the third parties, Ms. Strang and Ms. Valdes, was permitted to defer her cross-examination of Mr. Grant until full disclosure had been made\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "69  The private investigator's reports and the employee records of those staff members who were working at the pub on the night in question, which I also ordered be produced, placed a far different complexion on the Steveston Hotel's conduct\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "70  The Steveston Hotel called Tim Derrick as a witness in its case. He was one of the servers on duty at the pub on June 11 and 12, 1999. He testified as to the signs of impairment he looked for in patrons, the communication among staff as to patrons who had become intoxicated, and the steps he took if a customer showed signs of impairment. He specifically stated that he was not permitted to drink alcohol while on the job\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  Like Mr. Kristjanson, Mr. Derrick could not recall anything out of the ordinary on the night in question. Counsel for the hotel had suggested in the examination of other witnesses that patrons of the pub could bring in their own beer and thereby avoid monitoring of alcohol consumption by the pub staff. Mr. Grant suggested that it was a routine occurrence. However, Mr. Derrick testified that in the time he had worked in the pub he had only noticed beer cans (which were not sold in the pub) under the tables after closing on a couple of occasions. He could not recall any cans on the floor on June 12, 1999\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "72  Mr. Derrick confirmed under cross-examination that he followed the Serving It Right guidelines. He knew he was prohibited from over-pouring or free-pouring drinks. He said he knew that Mr. Grant trusted him not to do so and that he was careful to comply. He said that he always measured drinks. He was never disciplined or spoken to about infractions in that regard\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "73  Mr. Derrick also agreed that playing cards while on the job could constitute a distraction from his duty to be vigilant. He said that he would never socialize with friends or drink alcohol while on the job. He agreed that to do so could impair his judgement and make it difficult to enforce the Serving It Right guidelines\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "74  However, Mr. Derrick was not aware that Mr. Grant had hired a private investigator to monitor his staff, including Mr. Derrick. The investigator's reports that were produced showed that on August 1, 1999, Mr. Derrick was observed playing cribbage with another server, Gwen Ivansky. On September 28, 1999, Mr. Derrick was observed free-pouring a drink known as a \"Paralyzer.\" He was also observed free-pouring a drink below the bar counter, something that even Mr. Derrick agreed he was \"technically\" not supposed to do. On October 5, 1999, Mr. Derrick and Ms. Ivansky were again observed playing cribbage and ignoring customers\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "75  The Steveston Hotel also called Susan Boshard as a witness. She was one of the three bartenders on duty on June 11 and 12, 1999. She has worked at the Steveston Hotel since March 1989\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "76  In her examination in chief, Ms. Boshard presented herself as the model bartender. She confirmed that she obtained her Serving It Right certification prior to June 1999. She said that through the program she \"learned to be a responsible alcohol host and to serve alcohol properly.\" She enumerated the signs of intoxication and the options available to her in dealing with intoxicated patrons\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "77  Ms. Boshard, like Mr. Kristjanson and Mr. Derrick, could not recall anything unusual on the evening of June 11 and 12, 1999. She said that she did not drink alcohol that evening, emphasizing that it was not allowed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "78  Ms. Boshard's image as the model bartender was shattered under cross-examination. She agreed with the proposition put to her that \"the joint was jumping\" on June 11, 1999. She agreed that the three servers would have been very busy. She agreed that when she was a server she would have been hard-pressed to serve 60 or 70 patrons. She said that on busy nights the pub usually had four or five servers. She agreed that there is a correlation between the number of servers and the number of intoxicated patrons. She agreed that she had seen many people drunk in the pub. She testified that in 1999 she called the police at least once a week to deal with drunk patrons. She said that, on an average night, she would see one or two \"drunk drunks,\" and possibly more on a busy night. She confessed to not being surprised to hear about the accident in question and the speculation that a drunk driver who had been at the pub was involved. As she said, \"There were one or two drunks every night.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "79  Ms. Boshard also agreed that some drunks are \"tricksters\" in the sense that they will go out of their way to avoid detection. They will, for instance, have their friends purchase drinks for them, or will move from section to section in the pub, or will simply lie about having a safe ride home\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  Ms. Boshard agreed that she is not a casual observer of imbibing customers. She is a professional observer. If a patron asks for a glass, she asks why they are asking for it in order to reduce the possibility that the glass is to be used for alcohol brought onto the premises. She agreed that alcohol is infrequently smuggled into the bar\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "81  Under cross-examination by counsel for the third parties, Ms. Strang and Ms. Valdes, Ms. Boshard confirmed that under the Serving It Right program it is important to monitor the number of drinks served. An important component of this monitoring is to not over-serve or free-pour drinks. Ms. Boshard confirmed that she was instructed to not free-pour or over-pour drinks. She said that she had never done so\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "82  Ms. Boshard further confirmed that she tried to observe all aspects of the Serving It Right program. She knew that Mr. Grant had \"zero tolerance\" for employees drinking on the job. She testified that she did not do so under any circumstances. She agreed that her ability to enforce the Serving It Right program and to monitor patrons would be diminished if she consumed alcohol while on duty\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  Ms. Boshard confirmed that she had never been disciplined by the Steveston Hotel for drinking alcohol on the job, for over-pouring, or for free-pouring\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  However, Ms. Boshard did not know that Mr. Grant had hired a private investigator. The private investigator's reports were put to Ms. Boshard. On August 25, 1999 (her birthday), Ms. Boshard was observed consuming a shooter of alcohol. The same evening she poured a drink for a customer and advised him that a server, Dawn Abbott, had bought it for him. She knew that this was strictly forbidden. She was observed free-pouring alcohol into coffee. She agreed that, at the time, the Steveston Hotel was, in counsel's words, \"wild and woolly.\" She agreed that the point of drinking shooters is to get drunk. She agreed that later on the same evening she drank another shooter given to her by a customer. She agreed with the proposition that she was \"slamming back shooters\" contrary to the Serving It Right program\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  On March 1, 1999, Ms. Boshard was seen over-pouring a \"Perfect Martini\" as a favour for a patron who tipped her \"a fair bit.\" She over-poured another martini. She also free-poured alcohol into two mugs of hot chocolate that were then consumed by her and a server, Gwen Ivansky. Ms. Boshard agreed that if she and Ms. Ivansky were consuming alcohol, they would have had difficulty supervising customers\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  Mr. Grant's cross-examination continued on the twelfth day of trial. The previous day I had ordered production of all records of the Steveston Hotel relating to the employment of the staff on duty on June 11, and 12, 1999. Once again, the document disclosure cast the Steveston Hotel in a much less favourable light than that represented in Mr. Grant's examination in chief\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "87  I have already noted that in Mr. Grant's earlier testimony he frequently responded to questions by saying \"It's possible.\" That unhelpful response continued. However, even more troubling were Mr. Grant's obtuse responses to questions put to him in cross-examination. He left the impression that he did not know and did not care about critical aspects of the pub's operation that were central to the litigation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "88  Mr. Grant was ultimately forced to admit that, contrary to the evidence given by Mr. Kristjanson at his examination for discovery that Ms. Ivansky had quit, she had in fact been fired. That admission was only made when Mr. Grant was confronted with the employee records that had been ordered to be produced the day before\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "89  Mr. Grant had testified in chief that there were no written policies governing the pub staff in 1999. However, the disclosure ordered the previous day produced a document dated January 15, 1998 entitled \"House Rules.\" Mr. Grant equivocated by saying that he was not sure if those rules had been adopted by the union. He ultimately conceded that the rules, in his words, \"seemed to accord with what the staff were doing at the time.\" He was further forced to concede that there was nothing in those rules requiring staff to make sure that intoxicated patrons got a safe ride home\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "90  Mr. Grant dodged the suggestion that employees were not permitted to play cribbage while on duty. He said that it was \"generally a rule.\" However, he was forced to agree, when confronted with documentary evidence, that Ms. Ivansky was fired for playing cribbage while on duty on a slow night\n",
      "======\n",

      "91  Mr. Grant agreed that free-pouring was forbidden under the house rules. Employees were also forbidden to accept drinks from customers.

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "92  Mr. Grant again confirmed that he had no tolerance for employees drinking on the job. He agreed that if he learned of such conduct he would deal with it and \"go the distance to get them out.\" He agreed that a bartender who drank on the job would constitute \"a huge problem.\n",

He suggested that he might have spoken to some, but that, in his words, he did not \"commit a lot of stuff to writing.\" He had no reason to contradict Ms. Boshard's evidence that she had never been disciplined for over-pouring or for drinking on the job. He admitted that he accepted the private investigator's reports as truthful\n",

      "95  Mr. Grant was shown other examples of employee violations of the Serving It Right guidelines. The only employee who was disciplined was Ms. Ivansky. Indeed, Mr. Grant agreed that she was fired because she was \"snarky\" and impolite to customers, not because she had violated the Serving It Right guidelines. Incredibly, Mr. Grant agreed with the proposition that Ms. Ivansky's conduct was more serious than a bartender drinking on the job. That astonishing sentiment was amplified by the evidence that Ms. Boshard was only disciplined for contacting a bartender about a previous day's float, for failing to project a friendly demeanour, and for failing to answer the pub telephone. She was not disciplined for drinking alcohol on the job, for free-pouring or over-pouring drinks, or for giving free drinks to patrons\n",

Employees flagrantly flaunted both the house rules and the Serving It Right guidelines. Discipline was only meted out when the perceived direct financial interests of the pub were affected by staff conduct\n",

      "\n",
      "99  Second, it explains how Melissa Goldie, a witness who was 19 years old at the time, was heavily intoxicated while at the pub on June 11 and 12, 1999. No one refused to serve her. She testified that she was intoxicated when she arrived at the pub and that the doorman let her in\n",

      "\n",
      "100  Third, it explains how Mr. McWilliams' friend, Sheldon Reid, was able to consume eight pints of beer over three hours on June 11 and 12, 1999. He testified that he had also drunk three beers before going to the pub at about 10:00 p.m. on June 11. When he left with Mr. McWilliams he was drunk, almost staggering, and certainly not capable of driving. No one intervened\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "101  Fourth, it explains why Shelley Yokim observed Mr. McWilliams to be drunk in the pub on June 11, 1999. Another witness in the pub that night, Laura Reinke, described Mr. McWilliams as, in her words, \"wasted\" and obviously very drunk. He stumbled towards her drinking a pint of beer. She heard Robyn Strang call out for assistance. She observed Ms. Strang trying to take Mr. McWilliams' keys from him in the pub. She remembered that there was a bouncer at the back door leading to the parking lot. She testified that when she left the bouncer never asked how much she had to drink or whether she was driving. Indeed, she stated, \"They [the pub] don't do that now.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "102  Lastly, Mr. Holmes, Mr. Moran, and Mr. Hafiz all testified that they had consumed alcohol in the pub when they were minors. They were never asked to produce identification. As Mr. Hafiz testified, \"It was a good place to go if you wanted to get drunk.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "103  It is obvious from the foregoing review of the evidence concerning the Steveston Hotel that I have no confidence in the credibility of Mr. Grant and the employees of the hotel who testified. Wherever their evidence is in conflict with the evidence of Ms. Strang and the others who testified as to the level of supervision in the pub, I accept the evidence of Ms. Strang and the others over the evidence of the Steveston Hotel's witnesses.\n",

      "104  The overwhelming weight of the evidence establishes that Mr. McWilliams was grossly impaired on June 12, 1999. He pled guilty on August 10, 2000, to the offence of impaired driving causing bodily harm, for which he received a 14-month conditional sentence. There can be no question that he was responsible for the collision with the five plaintiffs\n",

      "The driver of a vehicle must not cause or permit the vehicle to overtake and pass on the right of another vehicle, except\n",
      "when the vehicle overtaken is making a left turn or its driver has signalled his or her intention to make a left turn,\n",
      "when on a laned roadway there is one or more than one unobstructed lane on the side of the roadway on which the driver is permitted to drive, or\n",
      "on a one way street or a highway on which traffic is restricted to one direction of movement, where the roadway is free from obstructions and is of sufficient width for 2 or more lanes of moving vehicles.\n",
      "Despite subsection (1), a driver of a vehicle must not cause the vehicle to overtake and pass another vehicle on the right\n",
      "when the movement cannot be made safely, or\n",
      "by driving the vehicle off the roadway\n",
      "======\n",

      "106  As the Court held in Fabellorin v. Peterson  (C.A.), at [paragraph] 13:\n",
      "Section 160 [now s. 158] imposes a heavy onus on the driver of a vehicle attempting to pass other vehicles on the right. More especially is this so when the vehicles ahead have stopped or slowed on the roadway other than at an intersection or a crosswalk when there is no apparent reason for their doing so. The very fact that they have done so should alert the driver of the overtaking vehicle, intending to pass, that there must be some reason for the drivers ahead of him to have acted as they did and this should have alerted the overtaking driver to exercise extra caution to ensure that he or she can pass on the right safely\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "107  Furthermore, s. 179(3) of the Act reads:\n",
      "If a vehicle is slowing down or stopped at a crosswalk or at an intersection to permit a pedestrian to cross the highway, the driver of a vehicle approaching from the rear must not overtake and pass the vehicle that is slowing down or stopped\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "108  Mr. Laface had not stopped his truck to permit pedestrians to cross Chatham Street. Nevertheless, pedestrians were on the road. Mr. McWilliams could not have known whether they were crossing the road or were there for some other reason. However, he ought to have known that because Mr. Laface's truck was stopped, there was a possibility that pedestrians were crossing at the intersection. Mr. McWilliams had a duty under s. 158 of the Act to exercise extra caution when he stopped behind the Laface truck and before proceeding to pass on the right\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "109  Even if Mr. McWilliams was not obliged to refrain from passing the Laface truck under s. 179(3), it is clear that he was obliged to exercise care under s. 181 of the Act:\n",
      "Despite sections 178, 179 and 180, a driver of a vehicle must\n",
      "exercise due care to avoid colliding with a pedestrian who is on the highway,\n",
      "give warning by sounding the horn of the vehicle when necessary, and\n",
      "observe proper precaution on observing a child or apparently confused or incapacitated person on the highway\n",

      "\n",
      "110  It is, of course, extremely significant that in the circumstances at bar there were between 15 and 40 pedestrians in the vicinity of the corner of Chatham Street and First Avenue. Mr. Hafiz testified that the sidewalk was so packed with people that it was difficult to move back onto the sidewalk from the road. Only a grossly intoxicated driver would fail to see what was there to be seen: a horde of young people making so much noise that it awakened Mr. Laface's wife in their apartment. Ms. Strang saw the pedestrians and exercised the caution required of her under s. 181 of the Act. There can be no excuse for Mr. McWilliams' failure to do the same\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "111  Lastly, I must address the hotel's submission that Mr. McWilliams was negligent in not wearing his glasses when he drove from the hotel. Mr. McWilliams' evidence on the point was read-in from his examination for discovery:\n",
      " Q.:  Were you wearing either your glasses or your contacts on the night of the accident? \n",
      " A.: I can't remember. \n",

      "\n",
      "112  Patrick Bishop testified, on behalf of the hotel, that Mr. McWilliams was not wearing glasses when he observed him in the pub. He said that Mr. McWilliams had not worn glasses (which he described as \"Coke bottle glasses\") since he was about 16 years old\n",

      "115  Accordingly, I find that Mr. McWilliams was negligent and that his negligence caused the injuries to the plaintiffs.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Lafac\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "116  As I have noted, the Steveston Hotel argued (and the pedestrian plaintiffs pleaded) that Mr. Laface contributed to the cause of the accident by stopping his pick-up truck in the roadway without good reason and creating an obstruction, and by failing to adequately warn oncoming traffic of the obstacle he had created by activating his hazard lights\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "117  The hotel argued that Mr. Laface was in breach of ss. 187 and 190 of the Act, the relevant portions of which read:\n",
      "Subject to subsection (3), if outside of a business or residence district it is practicable to stop, park or leave a vehicle off the roadway, a person must not stop, park or leave the vehicle either unattended or attended on the roadway.\n",
      "Subject to subsection (3), a person must not park a vehicle so as to obstruct the free passage of traffic on the highway.\n",
      "Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply when a vehicle is so disabled that it is not practicable to avoid stopping and temporarily leaving it on a highway.\n",
      "...\n",
      "190  Except when a municipality or the Minister of Transportation and Highways permits, a driver must not stop, stand or park a vehicle on a roadway other than on the right side of the roadway and with the right hand wheels parallel to that side, and where there is a curb, within 30 cm of the curb.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "118  The hotel also relies on the decision in Jordan v. Turpin (1998), 222 A.R. 268 (Q.B.), appeal allowed as to the allocation of liability:  (C.A.). In that decision, the court held the driver of a pick-up truck who had stopped his truck in the inner lane of three southbound lanes of traffic on a bridge to be contributorily liable for the ensuing accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "119  The posted speed limit on the bridge was 80 kph. The plaintiff truck driver stopped his truck on the bridge when he noticed that two boxes of his load of six large cardboard-crated furnaces had come loose and fallen on the roadway. The plaintiff stopped his truck and backed up to the inner lane closest to the two boxes. As he was carrying the second of the two boxes to his truck, he was struck by the car driven by the defendant\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "120  The court held at [paragraph] 137-139:\n",
      "His contributory negligence began in not properly securing his load in the first instance. A satisfactory explanation was never given as to how the two 20 to 25 pound boxes ended up on the Capilano Freeway in the first place. On the evidence, it is simply not believable that a wave in the road and some wind could possibly cause the said two boxes to bounce out of the truck if they had been properly and securely packed on the Jordan truck in the first place.\n",
      "Further, Jordan's contributory negligence was continuous for a significant length of time from when he first stopped his truck on the Capilano Freeway up until the accident. He confirmed there was no reason he could not have pulled over tight to the left median other than perhaps the inconvenience to him that he would then have to climb over the passenger's seat to exit his truck. This is not an entirely satisfactory explanation for not parking on the shoulder.\n",
      "Although there is evidence from Constable Wallator that there was hard-packed snow or ice on part of the shoulder, possibly to a depth of ten inches, there is no evidence that Jordan was actually aware of this, nor do the pictures of the accident scene depict this extent of ice or snow, nor am I satisfied that this would have prevented Jordan from parking there in any event. Admittedly, it would have been messy to have parked and walked in such depth of ice and/or packed snow. However, it clearly would have been safer for Jordan and for the drivers on the Capilano Freeway since there still would have been something in the order of three metres open in the fast lane to the right of his truck for other vehicles to pass\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "121  The court held the plaintiff driver to be two-thirds liable for the accident. The Alberta Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiff's appeal and fixed liability at 50/50\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "122  I am not persuaded by the hotel's submission that the Jordan decision applies to the case at bar for several reasons. First, the decision in Jordan is obviously distinguishable on its facts from the circumstances at bar. The location of the Jordan truck when it was stopped - on a six-lane bridge where the posted speed limit was 80 kph and in winter conditions - is completely different from the place at which Mr. Laface stopped his truck. Mr. Laface stopped at an intersection on a warm summer night. The area was well lit. There were a large number of people at the intersection where Mr. Laface stopped his truck\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "123  Second, the time that Mr. Laface was stopped on the roadway was only a few minutes before he was struck down by Mr. McWilliams' car. As the court held in Chadwick v. Hopkins,  (S.C.) at [paragraph] 33, a vehicle stopped on the roadway for not less than two minutes and not more than four minutes was not \"parked\" as that term is used in s. 188 of the Act. It was \"stopped.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "124  Third, I find that the place at which Mr. Laface stopped his truck was not unreasonable in the circumstances. There can be no question that he was angry that someone had thrown a beer can at his truck. He was frustrated that the crowd had not moved on as he had requested. I accept that when he backed up to confront the crowd he did so in a careful manner. He stopped his truck as close to the curb as the existence of the crowd permitted. There was no reason in those circumstances for Mr. Laface to anticipate that a motorist approaching from the west would decide to pass his truck on the right in the parking lane. The only foreseeable hazard was that a vehicle approaching from the west might collide with the rear of his truck if the driver did not notice that the truck was stopped. However, given the weather and lighting conditions, the likelihood that a vehicle would not see his truck was remote. Indeed, even Mr. McWilliams in his drunken state saw the truck and stopped. Mr. McWilliams' conduct in driving headlong into the group of young people can only be described as bizarre. Mr. Laface could not possibly have foreseen that any one would conduct themselves in such a manner\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "125  Lastly, I accept Mrs. Laface's testimony that when she looked out of their apartment window after hearing the \"thud\" she observed flashing hazard lights on a truck that she later realized was the truck she and Mr. Laface owned. Her evidence on this point was not challenged\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "126  In these circumstances, I do not find that Mr. Laface's decision to stop his truck where he did constitutes negligence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "127  If I am wrong in making this finding, I would nevertheless find that Mr. Laface's stopping on Chatham Street was not a contributing cause of the plaintiffs' injuries. Mr. McWilliams had ample time to avoid any hazard created by Mr. Laface's truck. He in fact had stopped his car behind the truck. As counsel for Mr. Laface submitted, any risk that an eastbound vehicle would collide with the rear of Mr. Laface's truck, or would swerve to avoid a collision, ended as soon as Mr. McWilliams noticed the truck in time to come to a stop\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "128  The hotel argued that Mr. Laface, in making this submission, is asking the court to apply the doctrine of ultimate negligence and that the court should decline to do so. The hotel cited passages from A.M. Linden's Canadian Tort Law (Markham: Butterworths, 2001), including p. 340:\n",
      "It would also be helpful if the courts would approach these remoteness cases with the attitude that a person found to have been negligent should only be relieved of liability if the result of the negligence was truly \"freakish\", \"one in a million\", \"fantastic or highly improbable\". In other words, there should be an assumption of liability unless the court is convinced that it would be too harsh a result in the circumstances\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "129  If it were required, I would find that Mr. McWilliams' conduct fell within that described in the passage above quoted\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "130  Furthermore, the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in McKee v. Malenfant,  and Brooks v. Ward,  establish the so-called 'clear line' doctrine: that is, where a 'clear line' can be drawn between the negligence of the plaintiff and the negligence of the defendant, then the defendant will be held solely responsible. In Brooks, the Court held at p. 686:\n",
      "I do not believe that the appellant can be charged with negligence which contributed to the accident. In a case of McKee et al. v. Malenfant [], it was held by the majority of the Court that where a clear line can be drawn between the negligence of plaintiff and defendant, it is not a case of contributory negligence at all. When a driver sees a car in his path, and has plenty of opportunity to avoid it but fails to do so, there is no contributory negligence and he must bear the full responsibility. Or if, by his own negligence, he disables himself from becoming aware of a danger and cannot therefore avoid the accident, he is the only party to blame: Sigurdson v. B.C. Electric Co. [[1953] A.C. 302]. The same principles were applied by this Court in Bruce v. McIntyre []. It is because the facts were unidentical that a different conclusion was reached.\n",
      "In the present instance, the respondent had sufficient time to prevent this accident. Through his negligence he did not see the tail-lights of the parked car, which other witnesses could see; not having exercised a proper look-out, he continued at a speed of 30 to 35 miles an hour, and he placed himself in a situation where an accident was inevitable. There is, I think, a clear line that can be drawn between the negligence of the appellant, if any, and of the respondent, and there can be no contributory negligence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "131  This doctrine was recently confirmed (but not applied) by the Court of Appeal in Goett v. Fabi  (C.A.)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "132  The 'clear line' in the case at bar was when Mr. McWilliams stopped behind the Laface truck. His action in passing the truck on the right was solely a result of his own negligence, undoubtedly caused by his grossly intoxicated state. The cause of the accident was Mr. McWilliams' failure to appreciate the presence of pedestrians in the parking lane\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "133  As I have noted, the only 'risk' Mr. Laface created by stopping his truck where he did was that someone would collide with the rear of his truck. On this analysis, the risk of injury was avoided when Mr. McWilliams stopped his car behind the Valdes vehicle. It would therefore not be fair to hold Mr. Laface responsible for Mr. McWilliams' reckless behaviour in passing on the right and colliding with the pedestrians\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "134  This analysis is supported by the Court of Appeal decision in Scurfield v. Cariboo Helicopter Skiing Ltd.  (C.A.). The case arose from the death of the plaintiff, Mr. Scurfield, who had skied into an avalanche in progress ahead of him while on a wilderness helicopter skiing trip. His family recovered judgment at trial against the ski holiday company and the guide under the Family Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 126 on the basis that while Mr. Scurfield was 75 percent at fault for his own death, the company and guide were 25 percent liable. The defendants appealed the finding of liability, arguing that as Mr. Scurfield himself had skied into the avalanche, he should be found 100 percent responsible for his own death\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "135  Taylor J.A., speaking for the Court, framed the issues on appeal at [paragraph] 7-9:\n",
      "Thus the central question as to liability is whether the trial judge erred in concluding that the negligence of the guide in taking the party to the particular slope, as well as these acts of negligence on Mr. Scurfield's part, are in law all properly to be regarded as proximate causes of his death.\n",
      "It is urged on us by counsel for the plaintiff that for the court to dismiss the claim simply because Mr. Scurfield could readily have avoided the avalanche would involve application of the defence of 'last clear chance', an elusive doctrine statutorily abolished in this province by Section 8 of the Negligence Act, R.S.B.C. 1979 Chapter 298, which says:\n",
      "This Act applies to all cases where damage is caused or contributed to by the act of a person notwithstanding that another person had the opportunity of avoiding the consequences of that act and negligently failed to do so.\n",
      "The question in my view is not whether Mr. Scurfield could with reasonable care have avoided the danger--which, on the judge's view of the matter, he plainly could--but whether the conduct of the defendant guide in taking the party to the particular slope can properly be considered an act of negligence which had a proximate causative connection with the accident, when that accident happened after the hidden hazard to which Mr. Scurfield was thereby exposed had become obvious and readily avoidable.\n",
      "It may well be that Mr. Scurfield would not have died had the party been taken to another slope. It may also be said that he would have lived had he waited for the skier ahead to complete his traverse, or for the guide to give the signal. I think it helpful to consider all these three acts of negligence and to ask whether there was a proximate, effective causative connection between each of them and his death\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "136  Taylor J.A. concluded that neither Mr. Scurfield's crossing of the slope before the skier ahead of him had reached the other side, nor his crossing of the slope without waiting for a signal from the guide were causes of his death. However, Mr. Scurfield's failure to follow the 'ski alert' rule and to heed the danger which he could clearly see ahead (and to which his attention was called) was, in law, a cause of his death. The question then became whether, after the danger became clearly visible to Mr. Scurfield and others began shouting at him to stop, the guide's negligence in bringing the group to the slope could still be regarded as a proximate cause of the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "137  At [paragraph] 15, the Court concluded:\n",
      "The risk which Mr. Scurfield faced when he continued on in the face of obvious and avoidable peril--if properly described as a 'risk'--must, in my view, be regarded as one falling well within the scope of those avoidable hazards which are to be regarded as reasonable and acceptable in the present context. This is not a case of Mr. Scurfield having had a 'last clear chance' to avoid a peril created by the defendants. Insofar as the defendants had a duty to protect Mr. Scurfield from unreasonable risk of unavoidable avalanche, that risk was over once the hazard had become obvious and avoidable. On the findings of the trial judge I conclude that Mr. Scurfield's failure to concern himself with what he could see ahead was the sole act of negligence which constituted in law a proximate cause of his death. [My emphasis.]\n",
      "In the result, the Court of Appeal allowed the defendants' appeal and dismissed the action. Leave to appeal this finding to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied, \n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "138  In applying the Scurfield analysis to the case at bar, while Mr. Laface obviously had a duty not to create unreasonable risks for other motorists on the road in stopping his truck, that risk (which was that someone would collide with his truck) was over once the hazard posed by his truck had become obvious and avoidable. In other words, when the Valdes vehicle and then the McWilliams vehicle safely came to a stop behind the Laface truck, that risk ceased. From that moment on, Mr. McWilliams' reckless behaviour became the sole proximate cause of the accident. If, speaking hypothetically, Mr. McWilliams had stopped behind the Laface truck, and then drove forward and collided with it, it would seem strange to find that Mr. Laface had created an unreasonable risk of collision when clearly Mr. McWilliams had been able to avoid a collision by stopping. The subsequent accident in this case was caused by Mr. McWilliams' careless decision to pass the truck on the right, where the pedestrians were clearly visible. Mr. McWilliams' conduct was so unusual in the circumstances that it was simply not a foreseeable danger. Mr. Laface cannot reasonably be said to have contributed to the cause of the accident. There is no doubt that Mr. McWilliams' conduct was effectively the sole cause of the accident.\n",

      "It is a logical step to move from finding that a duty of care is owed to patrons of the bar to finding that a duty is also owed to third parties who might reasonably be expected to come into contact with the patron, and to whom the patron may pose some risk. It is clear that a bar owes a duty of care to patrons, and as a result, may be required to prevent an intoxicated patron from driving where it is apparent that he intends to drive. Equally such a duty is owed, in that situation, to third parties who may be using the highways. In fact, it is the same problem which creates the risk to the third parties as creates the risk to the patron. If the patron drives while intoxicated and is involved in an accident, it is only chance which results in the patron being injured rather than a third party. The risk to third parties from the patron's intoxicated driving is real and foreseeable\n",

      "140  Referring to the Court's decision in Crocker v. Sundance Northwest Resorts Ltd., , Mr. Justice Major noted in Stewart, at [paragraph] 41:\n",
      "It is apparent from Wilson J.'s reasoning that there are two questions to be answered. The first is whether the defendant was required, in the circumstances, to take any positive steps at all. If this is answered in the affirmative, the next question is whether the steps taken by the defendants were sufficient to discharge the burden placed on them\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "141  The Steveston Hotel admitted that the requisite standard of care required it to:\n",
      "monitor the consumption of alcohol by its patrons;\n",
      "make reasonable assumptions from the amount of alcohol consumed by a patron as to whether he or she is likely to be impaired;\n",
      "monitor its patrons for behaviour and signs suggestive of intoxication; and\n",
      "take steps to prevent a patron from driving when it knew or ought to have known that the person was likely impaired and likely to drive\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "142  I have already reviewed the evidence in respect of the hotel's conduct in some detail. I have made findings of credibility. It is clear that Mr. McWilliams' consumption of alcohol was not monitored by the pub. Indeed, the fact that patrons were permitted to mill about the pub made it very difficult to monitor alcohol consumption at all. The only rational inference to be drawn from the evidence I have accepted is that the pub failed to meet the standard of care required of licensed premises\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "143  The evidence clearly establishes that Mr. McWilliams was demonstrating obvious signs of intoxication while in the pub. These signs included staggering and slurring of speech that were noticed by casual, untrained observers. In making this finding, I have not forgotten the evidence of Mr. Bishop, who was called as a witness by the hotel. He is at the pub nightly and was in the pub on the night in question. He has not consumed alcohol since 1990. He has known Mr. McWilliams since Mr. McWilliams was a child. He saw Mr. McWilliams at around 1:00 a.m. on June 12, 1999. He testified that Mr. McWilliams had been drinking, but, to his observation, was not intoxicated. He described him as a \"normal 19-year old boy.\" He did not see him stagger\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "144  However, under cross-examination, Mr. Bishop stated that it was not in Mr. McWilliams' character to walk up and shake hands (as he did that night). He agreed that Mr. McWilliams had a \"definite change of character\" brought on by the consumption of alcohol. In addition, Mr. Bishop agreed that he was not focussed on Mr. McWilliams. His observations consisted of \"a glance here and there.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "145  I do not question Mr. Bishop's sincerity. However, I find that his evidence concerning Mr. McWilliams' level of intoxication is unreliable. I prefer the evidence of other witnesses who were with Mr. McWilliams for longer periods of time and who had a better opportunity to observe his sobriety, most notably Ms. Strang\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "146  Mr. McWilliams' level of intoxication went unnoticed by the management and staff of the pub. That is likely so because the pub was understaffed. Alternatively, the staff may have been distracted on that night as they were observed to have been on the occasions when the private investigator visited the pub\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "147  Lastly, given my grave reservations concerning the testimony of Mr. Grant and his employees, I cannot rule out the possibility that they simply have chosen to lie and conceal their actual observations on June 11 and 12, 1999\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "148  However, the most compelling piece of evidence is the hotel's actual, specific notice that there was an impaired patron on the premises who intended to drive. Ms. Strang was only 17 years old at the time, but she did everything that could reasonably be expected of her in notifying the pub of Mr. McWilliams' state of inebriation. She specifically told the doorman that Mr. McWilliams was drunk and needed to find someone to drive his car for him. She shouted \"at the top of her lungs\" asking for assistance with the person who she knew was incapable of driving\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "149  The hotel, despicably in my view, attempted to shift the blame for failing to find a safe ride home for Mr. McWilliams from the hotel to Ms. Strang and other patrons of the pub. The country's highest court has stated unequivocally that the duty is on the commercial host. It obviously does not rest on the slender shoulders of a 17 year old or, indeed, any person other than the hotel's employees\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "150  I conclude that the hotel had actual knowledge of Mr. McWilliams' drunken state and the probability that, unless the hotel intervened, he would drive his car. Mr. McWilliams did not leave the pub with any sober persons. Mr. Reid, by his own admission, was drunk. In these circumstances, when it knew or ought to have known of Mr. McWilliams' intoxication and the real risk that he might drive, the hotel was obliged to prevent him from driving. The hotel did nothing\n",

      "\n",
      "152  In these circumstances, there can be no doubt that the hotel was negligent and that its negligence was a significant contributing cause of the horrific collision that occurred two blocks from the pub.\n",
      "The Plaintiff\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "153  The Steveston Hotel argues that all of the plaintiffs are contributorily negligent. The hotel relies on the relevant provision of the Act, s. 182(1):\n",
      "If there is a sidewalk that is reasonably passable on either or both sides of a highway, a pedestrian must not walk on a roadway.\n",
      "and the plaintiffs' common law duty to exercise due care for their own safety: Cook v. Teh  (C.A.)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "154  The hotel asserts that the plaintiffs contributed to the cause of their own injuries by:\n",
      "remaining on the travelled portion of the road rather than a position of safety on the sidewalk or, in Mr. Laface's case, in his truck;\n",
      "failing to maintain a proper lookout for oncoming eastbound traffic, including Mr. McWilliams' car; and\n",
      "consuming alcohol before the accident which rendered them less capable to perceive and respond to risks to their own safety\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "155  I will deal first with the third argument\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "156  There is little doubt that all of the plaintiffs had drunk some alcohol over the course of the evening of June 11, 1999. There is also no doubt, as Dr. Kirkwood testified, that the consumption of alcohol affects vision and reduces an individual's ability to judge distances and actually see oncoming vehicles. It is also true that persons under the influence of alcohol may take risks they would not otherwise take, and that alcohol affects their ability to react to danger, including an approaching vehicle\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "157  Thus, the hotel places some emphasis on the level of intoxication of Messrs. Tremblay, Holmes, Moran and Hafiz as a contributing factor to their decision to leave a place of safety\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "158  There was considerable argument in reference to the reliability of the Vancouver General Hospital blood alcohol analyses of the above-noted plaintiffs. However, I consider it of no moment. The fact is that these plaintiffs, including Mr. Laface, were situated amidst a throng of 15 to 40 people. As I find later in these reasons, they were in an unmarked crosswalk. Mr. McWilliams' actions were such that even if the plaintiffs had been \"stone-cold\" sober, they could not have avoided the collision. Mr. McWilliams' conduct was, as I have stated, bizarre. It was entirely unforeseeable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "159  Section 179 (1) and (2) of the Act read:\n",
      "Subject to section 180, the driver of a vehicle must yield the right of way to a pedestrian where traffic control signals are not in place or not in operation when the pedestrian is crossing the highway in a crosswalk and the pedestrian is on the half of the highway on which the vehicle is travelling, or is approaching so closely from the other half of the highway that he or she is in danger.\n",
      "A pedestrian must not leave a curb or other place of safety and walk or run into the path of a vehicle that is so close it is impracticable for the driver to yield the right of way\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "160  The aerial photographs in evidence support a finding that the area in which the pedestrians congregated was an unmarked crosswalk: see the Act, s. 119. Sheldon Reid provided a statement to the police at 17:45 on June 12, 1999. Attached to his statement is a diagram in which Mr. Reid placed the location of the pedestrians. It shows them to be in front of the Laface truck and clearly within the boundaries of the unmarked crosswalk. Mr. Reid was not challenged in respect of his police statement or the attached diagram\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "161  The intersection of Chatham Street and First Avenue is, as the photographs in evidence demonstrate, somewhat unconventional. There are \"bulges\" in the curbs that are apparently designed to slow vehicular traffic and, presumably, ensure safer pedestrian traffic. The lines of the sidewalks do not conventionally join in parallel lines across the roadway. However, viewing the intersection as a whole, it constitutes an unmarked crosswalk as defined in s. 119 of the Act\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "162  Furthermore, the witnesses who observed the incident from the sidewalk clearly placed the Laface truck within the ambit of the unmarked crosswalk\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "163  All of the plaintiffs were in the unmarked crosswalk for at least two or three minutes before Mr. McWilliams arrived on the scene. They did not leave a place of safety and step into oncoming traffic as prohibited by s. 179(2) of the Act. They were in a crosswalk, albeit not for the purpose of crossing the roadway. However, Mr. McWilliams, had he been conscious of their presence, could not have known their reason for being on the road. Accordingly, I find that the plaintiffs enjoyed the right of way and were not contributorily negligent for their injuries\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "164  I will now address the first and second arguments of the hotel concerning the alleged contributory negligence of the plaintiffs. The hotel asserts that, by being present in the road rather than in a position of safety on the sidewalk or in the truck, the plaintiffs contributed to the cause of the accident. In this regard, the decision in Giuliani v. Saville  (C.A.) is of assistance. Giuliani concerned an appeal of a trial judge's finding that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent with respect to injuries he had suffered. On the night of the accident, the plaintiff and two friends had been drinking and were driving around the neighbourhood looking for other places to party. They saw the defendant with a young woman whom they recognized. The defendant made a rude gesture to the plaintiff and his friends and seemed to be interested in picking a fight. The plaintiff got out of the car and approached the defendant, but there was no physical encounter\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "165  The defendant and the young woman jumped into a car and sped off in reverse, backing up over a curb and causing damage to a property. The plaintiff, knowing that the defendant would have to drive around the block to reach an arterial road, decided to go to an intersection around the corner in order to try to determine the defendant's license plate number as he drove by. The plaintiff initially stood near the centre of the roadway, then moved \"some distance to the south of the centreline.\" The Court of Appeal noted that the street was a typical residential street, wide enough for cars to park on both sides with room for cars to pass each other in the middle. The plaintiff continued to stand in the roadway as the defendant's car approached. As the car approached the plaintiff, it sped up and collided with the plaintiff. There was some dispute as to when the plaintiff had attempted to get out of the way of the defendant's vehicle, and as to whether the defendant had swerved to hit the plaintiff or had merely driven in a straight line\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "166  The trial judge, , concluded that the defendant had driven in a straight line, and found the plaintiff contributorily negligent to the extent of 30 percent of his injuries. The trial judge concluded that the plaintiff had ample opportunity to see the vehicle and had ample time to remove himself from the road. He also concluded that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to continue standing where he did, and that \"in waiting to the last moment to back up out of the path of the vehicle, the plaintiff omitted to act reasonably\" and to exercise the requisite degree of care for his own personal safety\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "167  Esson J.A., speaking for the Court, stated that the trial judge had erred in finding the plaintiff contributorily negligent in the circumstances, and that this conclusion had been reached \"without regard for the flagrant and almost unforeseeable conduct of the defendant and without regard for the fact that the defendant had ample room to steer clear of the plaintiff\" ([paragraph] 10). At [paragraph] 11-12, Esson J.A. observed:\n",
      "... In this case, there is no doubt that the plaintiff could see the defendant coming but it was not reasonably foreseeable that the defendant, who could see him equally well, would continue to drive towards him at an accelerated speed. Mr. James submits that, having regard to the previous exchange following the one finger salute, the plaintiff should have known that he would be in great danger if he stood in the road while the defendant approached. That to me is not a reasonable proposition. As I have said, this is a case of negligence on the part of the defendant of a kind and degree which is so great as to render it not reasonably foreseeable to the plaintiff that he was at risk until the car had got too close to him for him to take effective evasive action. The defendant's conduct was flagrant and deliberately reckless.\n",
      "I would, therefore, hold that no contributory negligence should have been found. I will add that, if I had not reached that conclusion, I would have assessed the fault of the plaintiff to be no more than 5%. There was in my view an error in principle in the approach to the allocation of fault in that it was not put on the basis which this Court held in Cempel v. Harrison Hot Springs Hotel Ltd.  should be employed. That basis is that the apportionment should be based on the degrees of fault rather than assessing relative degrees of causation as between the parties. [My emphasis.]\n",
      "In the result, the defendant was found 100 percent liable for the accident\n",
      "PERCENT MENTIONED\n",
      "['5%']\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "168  The facts in Giuliani bear more than a passing resemblance to the facts in the case at bar. I note that in both cases, the plaintiff(s) had been drinking and in both cases, the defendant driver had engaged in conduct which can only be described as reckless. By analogy, the reasoning in Giuliani supports the conclusion that where, as here, the defendant driver's behaviour was so unforeseeable and the risk of injury from the plaintiffs' failure to take care was so unlikely in the circumstances, it is simply not appropriate to find that the plaintiffs were contributorily negligent\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "169  The defendants in the case at bar have also argued that the plaintiff pedestrians were negligent in 'leaving a place of safety' (in violation of the Act) and stepping out onto the road. This argument is not tenable for two reasons. First, the case of Christie (Guardian ad Litem of) v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia  (C.A.) establishes that causation is not to be assumed merely because there has been a breach of statute or there is some evidence suggesting that a failure to take care contributed to the accident. Second, the wording of the Act and the decision in Traynor v. Degroot, , , indicate that a pedestrian is only responsible for their own injuries where they have effectively stepped out into oncoming traffic without looking. In Traynor, the plaintiff jogged up to an intersection. The cars in the curb lane stopped to allow her to cross at the crosswalk. The defendant cab driver pulled out into an inside lane and accelerated past the stopped cars, colliding with the plaintiff in the intersection\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "170  Curtis J. concluded that the plaintiff had not been negligent in the circumstances. She had observed the cars in the eastbound lane to have stopped or slowed down and she had been motioned to cross. As Curtis J. observed at [paragraph] 23-24, the plaintiff\n",
      "... [had] every reason to believe that in the brief time she would be crossing the eastbound lanes she could do so in safety. What changed was that Mr. Degroot changed lanes and accelerated when it was not reasonable or prudent for him to do so or for her to expect that he would.\n",
      "When Eileen Traynor stepped off the curb and into the crosswalk she did not walk or run into the path of a vehicle that was so close it was impractical for the driver to yield the right of way. ..\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "171  In the case at bar, the hotel has submitted that the plaintiffs were guilty of contributory negligence for being in the roadway while inebriated and for not keeping a proper lookout. Again, this submission is simply untenable on the evidence. Even if it could be said that the plaintiffs were in the roadway in violation of the Act, the reasoning of Curtis J. in Traynor implies that a pedestrian is not contributorily negligent unless he or she steps into the path of oncoming traffic in a manner that makes it impractical for the driver to yield the right of way. The fact that the plaintiffs were inebriated is not relevant because it is clear that Mr. McWilliams' conduct was so bizarre and unforeseeable that nobody could realistically have avoided him, even if completely sober. The hotel has suggested that had the plaintiffs been sober, they would not have been in the road in the first place. However, that suggestion is simply speculation. It is equally plausible that even if the plaintiffs were sober, they would have entered into the road in any event, not seeing any oncoming traffic and not expecting someone to pass the Laface truck in the parking lane, in response to the antagonisms of Mr. Laface's passenger.\n",
      "Robyn Strang and Cristina Valde\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "172  As I have previously noted, the Steveston Hotel argues that Ms. Strang and Ms. Valdes contributed to the cause of the accident by stopping their vehicle in the roadway without adequately warning other motorists, and by obstructing the sightlines of other motorists and the pedestrians\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "173  At the close of the hotel's case, counsel for Ms. Strang and Ms. Valdes applied under Rule 40(8) and (9) for dismissal of the hotel's claims against them. With some reluctance, I dismissed the third parties' motion because I was concerned that to grant the motion would require me to improperly weigh the quality of the evidence concerning Ms. Strang's and Ms. Valdes' involvement in the events of June 11 and 12, 1999\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "174  However, on the evidence that I have accepted, there is absolutely no foundation for finding either Ms. Strang or Ms. Valdes responsible for the tragic events of that night\n",

      "175  I have already found that the Laface truck did not constitute an obstruction. I have also noted that it is even more unlikely that the Valdes vehicle created an obstruction\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "176  There is no evidence that Ms. Strang's ability to operate Ms. Valdes' vehicle was impaired in any way. By all accounts, her driving on the night in question was careful and ordinary, notwithstanding the fact that she did not have a valid driver's licence and had been drinking. Corporal While, who dealt with Ms. Strang at the scene, testified that he could recall nothing that indicated that she was intoxicated. Constable Devries interviewed Ms. Strang. He found her to be lucid and coherent. He said that if he believed she was impaired, he would have noted that belief in his notes. He did not\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "177  Ms. Strang did what any careful and responsible motorist would do as she approached the Laface truck: she slowed down, braked, and attempted to determine what had caused the Laface vehicle to be stopped in the road. She stopped the car approximately one car length from the truck. She left the vehicle in drive and kept her foot on the brake. She called out to a friend she recognized on the street. The accident occurred suddenly and less than one minute after she arrived at the scene. After the collision, she pulled the car towards the south curb and parked it. She then attempted to render assistance to the victims\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "178  As counsel for Ms. Strang noted, the hotel pleaded but did not argue that Ms. Strang was negligent by reason of not having a driver's licence. The argument was not pursued and the hotel did not provide authority for this proposition. Ms. Strang and Ms. Valdes provided the decisions in Walker v. British Columbia Electric Railway Co.,  (B.C.C.A.) and Singh v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. (1914), 20 D.L.R. 511 (B.C.C.A.). Although it is possible to read these cases narrowly as standing merely for the proposition that a plaintiff who does not have a valid driver's licence at the time of a motor vehicle accident is not disentitled to recover in negligence, it is arguable that the cases also stand for the broader proposition that whether or not someone has a driver's licence is not relevant to the issue of negligence, unless the opposing party can show that the lack of a licence was a contributing cause of the accident. Also to the same effect is the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Burchill v. Vancouver (City)  (C.A.). In the case at bar, it is obvious that Ms. Strang's lack of a driver's licence in no way caused or contributed to the accident, and therefore it is not surprising that this issue was not pressed in argument\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "179  Lastly, in regard to the failure to activate hazard lights, I conclude that Ms. Strang was not negligent in failing to activate hazard lights: Cawson v. Quandt  (C.A.)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "180  As regards Ms. Valdes, there is no credible evidence that supports the hotel's submission that Ms. Valdes was negligent in allowing Ms. Strang to drive when her ability to do so was allegedly impaired by fatigue or other \"mental\" condition. Ms. Strang was not cross-examined on the issue of fatigue or, indeed, on the issue of alcohol impairment\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "181  Ms. Valdes was content to have Ms. Strang drive for good reasons. Ms. Valdes considered her own ability to drive to be impaired and she did not believe she was a very good driver\n",

      "\n",
      "182  There is no law that requires a passenger to direct the manner in which a driver operates a vehicle. Even if there were, there is no evidence that the conduct of Ms. Strang was unreasonable in any respect and required any such direction\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "183  Finally, I must address the startling submission that Ms. Strang was motivated by guilt in giving evidence that implicates the hotel. That astonishing allegation completely ignores the fact that Ms. Strang gave the hotel a chance to avoid responsibility for this horrific event: she told the pub doorman in unmistakeable terms that Mr. McWilliams was drunk and not fit to drive home. To now attempt to deflect blame to Ms. Strang is, as her counsel contended, outrageous. If one person acted responsibly on June 12, 1999, it was Ms. Strang. That is so even in light of the fact that she lied to the police when she initially stated that she was not the driver of the Valdes car. That statement was clearly wrong. However, she had the moral fortitude to correct her lapse in honesty when she went to the R.C.M.P. on April 22, 2000, and told them the truth. Unlike the Steveston Hotel, she was prepared to take responsibility for her actions\n",

      "One of the primary purposes of negligence law is to enforce reasonable standards of conduct so as to prevent the creation of reasonably foreseeable risks. In this way, tort law serves as a disincentive to risk-creating behaviour. To impose liability even where the risk which materialized was not reasonably foreseeable is to lay a portion of the loss at the feet of a party who has, in the circumstances, acted reasonably. Tort law does not require the wisdom of Solomon. All it requires is that people act reasonably in the circumstances. The \"reasonable person\" of negligence law was described by Laidlaw J.A. in this way in Arland v. Taylor, [1955] O.R. 131 (C.A.), at p. 142:\n",
      "He is not an extraordinary or unusual creature; he is not superhuman; he is not required to display the highest skill of which anyone is capable; he is not a genius who can perform uncommon feats, nor is he possessed of unusual powers of foresight. He is a person of normal intelligence who makes prudence a guide to his conduct. He does nothing that a prudent man would not do and does not omit to do anything a prudent man would do. He acts in accord with general and approved practice. His conduct is guided by considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs.

McLintock  (S.C.) at [paragraph] 27:\n",
      "In pragmatic terms, responsibility placed on commercial hosts is likely to be most effective as a deterrent in keeping intoxicated drivers off the roads. The cost of damage awards should modify rational conduct of commercial hosts directed to maximizing economic advantage. The risk of the motorist's impecuniosity in a catastrophic injury case falls on the plaintiff in British Columbia where, as here, the plaintiff is contributorily at fault.

      "\n",
      "1  On March 31, 2010 the plaintiff, Trevor Nelson, was cycling in the eastbound curb lane through the intersection of Hastings and Nanaimo Streets in Vancouver when he collided with a large right-turning truck (the \"Accident\"). The truck was driven by the defendant, Joseph Conarroe, and owned by the defendant, Lafarge Canada Inc. After signalling his intention to do so, Mr. Conarroe turned right from Hastings onto Nanaimo without noticing Mr. Nelson on his bicycle nearby before, during or immediately after the Accident. The truck struck and dragged Mr. Nelson along the roadway until Mr. Conarroe was alerted to what had happened by bystanders waving and calling out\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "2  Mr. Nelson was seriously injured as a result of the Accident. He claims damages for those injuries, which he says were caused by Mr. Conarroe's negligence in failing to observe him and turning right as he was cycling through the intersection. The defendants respond that Mr. Nelson is the negligent party and solely responsible for the Accident because he overtook the truck on the right when it was unsafe to do so. By agreement, the parties seek a determination as to liability on a summary trial\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "3  The evidence presented at the summary trial was unusual because the Accident was captured on video surveillance recordings from a nearby grocery market (the \"Video\"). The Video provides two perspectives: an eastward view from a camera located close to the intersection and another eastward view from slightly further back. Several versions of Video footage were presented at trial in DVD form and marked as exhibits. The Video evidence was supplemented by affidavit evidence of the parties\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "4  Video surveillance recordings are often described to juries as a \"silent witness\". Depending on factors such as clarity and angle, it may be said that they constitute cogent evidence unsullied by human frailties such as bias, emotion and memory distortion. This case illustrates the truth of such remarks\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "5  But for the Video a judge or jury in this case would have been required to find facts based on the parties' competing accounts of what occurred shortly before, during and after the Accident. Those accounts differed in many respects, but coalesced on one key point. In statements given after the Accident both Mr. Nelson and Mr. Conarroe claimed the traffic light at the intersection was red immediately prior to the Accident. As is clear from the Video, however, both were wrong. In fact, and importantly, the light was green for several seconds before it occurred.\n",
      "FACT\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "6  Mr. Nelson was 29 years old at the time of the Accident. He was an experienced cyclist employed as a bicycle mechanic at a bike shop in North Vancouver\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "7  Although he held a valid driver's license, Mr. Nelson did not own or drive a motor vehicle. Rather, he used his bicycle as his primary means of transport in and around the Lower Mainland\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "8  On the morning of the Accident, Mr. Nelson left his home in Vancouver and cycled toward his work place in North Vancouver. The day was sunny and calm. The roads were dry. Visibility was good\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "9  The Accident happened at approximately 9:20 a.m. on March 31, 2010. Immediately beforehand, Mr. Nelson was cycling east on Hastings toward the intersection with Nanaimo (the \"Intersection\")\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "10  The Intersection is controlled by traffic lights\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "11  Traffic was moderately heavy at the time of the Accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "12  There are three eastbound lanes on Hastings in the area of the Intersection: a curb lane, a middle lane, and a center lane. Parking was permitted in the curb lane when the Accident occurred. Immediately prior to its occurrence there were at least three vehicles parked on Hastings in the block approaching Nanaimo from the west side of the Intersection. On the east side of Hastings, the curb lane was filled with parked cars\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "13  The curb lane is 134 inches wide. In the block of Hastings approaching Nanaimo from the west side the parked cars were positioned close to the curb in a regular manner. I am satisfied there was sufficient room left in the curb lane for a bicycle to proceed without crossing the marked lane line and entering into the middle lane. I am also satisfied the same is true of the block on the other side of Nanaimo\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "14  Mr. Nelson was cycling in the curb lane eastbound toward the Intersection immediately prior to the Accident. It is impossible to estimate his speed with precision, but it is clear from the Video that he was cycling hard and fast\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "15  The traffic light turned green several seconds before Mr. Nelson arrived at the Intersection. When he entered it, he was struck by the front grill of the right-turning cement truck driven by Mr. Conarroe (the \"Truck\")\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  The Video shows Mr. Nelson cycling hard and fast alongside the Truck as the two approached the Intersection in tandem. Mr. Nelson's speed exceeded the Truck's and it is apparent he was overtaking it on the right as the Truck turned onto Nanaimo\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  Mr. Nelson swore an affidavit that was filed on the summary trial. In this affidavit, he deposed:\n",
      "Although I have a clear and present recollection of the events leading up to me arriving at the intersection of East Hastings Street and Nanaimo Streets my only recollection of the actual impact is of me entering the intersection at Nanaimo Street on a green light and then doing a left shoulder check and seeing the grill of a large truck bearing down on me\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  Prior to swearing the affidavit, however, Mr. Nelson had provided a statement dated June 3, 2010 at his lawyer's office. The statement was based on his memory of events before he had an opportunity to review other materials. In contrast, he swore the affidavit after reading police reports and watching the Video. In paragraph 16, he deposed:\n",
      "Upon revisiting the circumstances of the ACCIDENT months later and with the benefit of further information, including the Vancouver Police Department report, I realized that my description of the incident as entrenched in the statement I had earlier provided was erroneous in a couple of respects. I then realized that I had not stopped at the intersection to drink from my water bottle nor had I unclipped my bike shoes nor stood for approximately thirty seconds waiting for the light to change. When I provided this information to my lawyer and through him to the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, I assumed it to be true and accurate although upon reviewing the police report and corresponding surveillance video CD that was later provided to me I realized that my recollection of the actual incident was, in these respects, not accurate. I was mistaken and now realize that I had not stopped at Nanaimo Street but had already entered the intersection and had begun to cross it when struck and dragged by the cement truck. Upon reflection I realized that my description of unclipping my shoes and so forth must have been constructed by me premised upon my usual and, indeed, invariable practice when stopping my bicycle at an intersection\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  I accept that Mr. Nelson recalls seeing the grill of the Truck bearing down upon him at the time of impact, as deposed in his affidavit. I conclude, however, that, standing alone, his recollection of events surrounding the Accident is otherwise unreliable. In reaching this conclusion I have considered the strikingly different version of events Mr. Nelson gave before and after seeing the Video. I have also considered the fact that Mr. Nelson was seriously injured in the Accident, which may have compromised his memory and confused him as to precisely what occurred\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "20  Mr. Nelson testified on discovery that he does not recall if he noticed the Truck as he cycled toward the Intersection. He acknowledged, however, and I find, that at some point he became aware of a large vehicle travelling beside him in the middle lane. This recollection, vague though it may be, is consistent with what is depicted in the Video. So, too, is Mr. Nelson's acknowledgement that, as he cycled along Hastings, his attention was focused on where he was going, straight ahead\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "21  Mr. Nelson did not make eye contact with Mr. Conarroe as the two travelled along Hastings and entered the Intersection in tandem. He did not consider whether he might have been in the Truck's blind spot at any point on Hastings. He did not check to see if the Truck was signaling a right turn\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "22  I am satisfied that, as is his common practice, Mr. Nelson did perform a shoulder check as he entered the Intersection. At that point, however, the Truck was already turning right and it was too late to avoid the impact\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "23  Mr. Conarroe was 45 years old at the time of the Accident. He was employed by Lafarge as a \"mixer driver\" and had driven cement trucks for approximately 12 years\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  When Mr. Conarroe started work on the morning of the Accident he was assigned the Truck to operate. The Truck was familiar to him as he had driven it many times in the preceding four years. He performed a pre-trip inspection before setting out for the job site and determined that the Truck was in good working order\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "25  The Truck is very tall and very heavy. It has a hood that is higher than Mr. Conarroe, who stands 5'10'' tall. When sitting in the driver's seat, he is positioned approximately 7 feet above the ground\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  The Truck has two turn signals: one at the rear, the other at the front\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  At the rear of the Truck on each side is an approximately 4 inches in diameter circular red flashing turn signal. The signal light is embedded in the metal casing that forms the rear wheel well and located 47 inches off the ground, out to the side\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  The other turn signal is mounted to the outside of the Truck's front fender in each front corner. It is a square orange signal light located 66 inches off the ground and approximately 4.5 inches wide\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  The Truck has rear view mirrors, side view mirrors, and convex mirrors. The side view mirrors are equipped with circular convex mirrors mounted at the base. The right such convex mirror is located 72 inches, or 6 feet, to the right of the driver. There are also convex mirrors mounted at the front hood of the Truck extending out on a bracket\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  Both sets of convex mirrors help the driver to see objects in the immediate vicinity. Objects which are several feet to the side of the Truck are reflected near the rims of the convex mirrors, however, where images are distorted and shrunken. By contrast, objects which are close to the Truck are reflected near the centre of the convex mirrors, which also distorts by expanding the object's size. As a result, objects near the rims appear reduced in size and objects reflected in the centre appear enlarged\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  The convex mirror mounted at the base of the side view does not allow the driver to see objects adjacent to or in front of the mirror\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "32  The convex mirror mounted on the extending bracket out from the front corner of the hood helps the driver see objects that are very close to the front of the Truck. Unless an object is near the front corner of the Truck, however, it will be quite difficult for the driver to see\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "33  The convex mirrors do not help the driver to see objects which are parallel to, or in front of, the larger of the two convex mirrors and which are located several feet to the side of the Truck\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  As is apparent from the foregoing, despite its mirrors the Truck has many blind spots. The area beneath the right front hood is one of them, particularly when an object is close to the hood. For example, when a car is located beneath the right front of the hood it cannot be seen by the driver of the Truck\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  After performing his pre-trip inspection on the morning of the Accident, Mr. Conarroe loaded the Truck with cement at the Larfarge Harbour Plant. He then set out for the job site: a sidewalk repair on Nanaimo Street\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  En route to the job site Mr. Conarroe turned onto Hastings and proceeded eastbound in the middle lane toward Nanaimo. In an affidavit filed on the summary trial, he deposed that he saw Mr. Nelson cycling eastbound on the sidewalk near Lakewood Drive, but said he did not see him again until after the Accident occurred. He deposed further that, after driving past Mr. Nelson, he continued along Hastings, which is generally sloped uphill in this area. As he approached the Intersection, he stopped because the light governing eastbound traffic was red. At the same time, he activated his right turn signal\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  Mr. Conarroe went on to depose that there were at least four or five vehicles stopped ahead of him in the middle eastbound lane on Hastings. He was a little less than half a block from the Intersection when he came to a complete stop. He said that Mr. Nelson was nowhere to be seen as he waited with other traffic at the red light on Hastings. When the light turned green, he said he started to move the Truck toward the Intersection\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  According to Mr. Conarroe, when he started to move the Truck after the light turned green Mr. Nelson was still not visible in front of him, to his side, or behind him. He gradually picked up speed until he reached approximately 5 kph, at which point he had reached Nanaimo. His right turn signal remained activated throughout as he approached the Intersection and prepared to execute his turn. The Truck remained in first gear from the time he started up at the green light until after the Accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  Mr. Conarroe deposed further that, as he approached Nanaimo, he looked back and forth, and up and down Nanaimo, to ensure that traffic was totally clear so he could proceed with his right turn. Before executing the turn, he said he looked in all of the Truck's mirrors but did not see Mr. Nelson. He continued in first gear as he executed the right turn onto Nanaimo. The right turn signal light remained activated before, during, and after the turn\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "40  Mr. Conarroe turned the Truck from the middle lane of Hastings into the middle lane of Nanaimo and proceeded for approximately 100 feet southbound. He stopped the Truck, however, when he noticed people waving at him from a nearby bus shelter. He stood up, peered down in front of the grille and saw a bicycle handlebar sticking out beneath it. He did not see or hear anything at the time of impact and did not know he had been dragging Mr. Nelson and his bicycle executing the right turn\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "41  According to Mr. Conarroe, he did not see Mr. Nelson again after passing him cycling on the sidewalk near Lakewood Drive until after the Accident. He also did not hear a bell, a horn or any other form of auditory warning of Mr. Nelson's presence near the Truck. He conceded, however, that the Truck was making a great deal of noise\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "42  Like Mr. Nelson, Mr. Conarroe changed his account of the Accident after he watched the Video. For example, in his statement made shortly after the Accident Mr. Conarroe said the traffic light changed from green to yellow to red as he approached the Intersection on Hastings. After seeing the Video, however, he revised his account and stated he had come to a complete stop about four or five cars back from the Intersection in response to an existing red light. An extract from the transcript of his discovery includes the following exchange in this regard:\n",
      " Q:  In your statement, second paragraph, at the bottom, \"At about nine-twenty, I was heading eastbound on Hastings and began to slow down as I neared the intersection of Hastings and Nanaimo. I slowed down as I needed to turn on Nanaimo. As I approached the intersection, the light for Hastings changed from green to yellow and then red.\" Does that assist you memory? \n",
      " A: No, it doesn't. \n",
      " Q: \"And I came to a complete stop\". Is that accurate? \n",
      " A:  Well, I knew I came to a complete stop. And when I was talking to police officers, I thought I was, because he was questioning me right after the accident, I thought I was at the intersection, but I did come to a complete stop about four, five cars back. I mixed those two things up.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "43  In his statement Mr. Conarroe also described being approached by two pedestrians after the Accident. He said they told him the cyclist had tried to get around the Truck and had run the red light. After seeing the Video, however, Mr. Conarroe testified on discovery that he was unsure whether, in fact, the light was red, as he had previously asserted. He went on to testify that he recalled being told by the pedestrians that the bicyclist had tried to go around his cab\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "44  As with Mr. Nelson, the changes in Mr. Conarroe's account lead me to treat his evidence with considerable caution. Although uninjured, he was traumatised by the Accident and this may have coloured his recollection and perception of what transpired\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "45  In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that Mr. Conarroe saw Mr. Nelson cycling on the sidewalk near Lakewood Drive as he drove eastbound on Hastings. I am also not satisfied that Mr. Conarroe looked around the Truck before he began to turn right at the Intersection to the extent that he now claims. In particular, I do not accept that, as he deposed, Mr. Nelson was nowhere to be seen as Mr. Conarroe sat with other traffic at the red light on Hastings waiting for the light to turn green\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "46  It is clear from the Video that Mr. Conarroe did engage the Truck's right signal prior to executing his right turn onto Nanaimo. I accept that he did so well before he arrived at the Intersection after the light had turned green\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "47  I also accept that Mr. Conarroe looked around as he commenced his right turn from Hastings onto Nanaimo. In so doing, he checked the Truck's mirrors in an effort to determine what and who might be in the immediate area. I accept further that Mr. Conarroe was travelling at something in the range of 5 kph as he executed the right turn, although his speed cannot be estimated with precision. He did not, however, pause or stop from the time he started moving the Truck toward Nanaimo in response to the newly green light to the time he commenced his right turn\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  In addition, and importantly, I am not satisfied that Mr. Conarroe maintained a continuous and consistently vigilant look-out from the point at which he stopped for the red light on Hastings to the point at which he commenced his right turn onto Nanaimo. Had he done so, I find he could and would have seen Mr. Nelson cycling hard and fast eastbound in the curb lane behind and then beside the Truck\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "49  In making the above noted finding, I accept that Mr. Nelson was travelling in one of the Truck's blind spots when Mr. Conarroe commenced his right turn onto Nanaimo. This is why Mr. Conarroe did not see Mr. Nelson at that precise moment. Nevertheless, I also find that, as Mr. Nelson cycled eastbound behind and beside the Truck, he would have been visible to Mr. Conarroe at some point before he commenced the right turn had he checked the Truck's mirrors carefully and repeatedly. Unfortunately, he did not.\n",
      "LEGAL FRAMEWOR\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "50  In MacEachern (Committee of) v. Rennie, , Ehrcke J. conducted a helpful review of negligence principles in a case involving a cyclist and a heavy commercial vehicle. In so doing, he identified the four essential elements a plaintiff must prove in a negligence action:\n",
      "The defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff (a question of law for the trial judge to decide).\n",
      "The defendant breached that duty of care by failing to exercise the standard of care required of a reasonable and careful person in the circumstances (a question of fact for the trier of fact to decide).\n",
      "The plaintiff suffered damage (a question of fact for the trier of fact to decide).\n",
      "The plaintiff's damage was caused, in fact and in law, by the defendant's breach (a question of fact for the trier of fact to decide).\n",

      "======\n",

Section 158(1) prohibits one vehicle passing another on the right: \"The driver of a vehicle must not cause or permit the vehicle to overtake and pass on the right of another vehicle...\" There are only three exceptions. Essentially, passing on the right is permitted when the overtaken vehicle is turning left, when passing on a laned roadway, or when passing on a one-way street where room permits. A \"laned roadway\" is defined. It means a road that is divided into two or more marked lanes for vehicles proceeding in the same direction.

      "[19] In Salaam, this Court found a defendant driver who had the right of way at an intersection negligent for having failed to take the steps it was said a reasonable driver would have taken in the circumstances to avoid a collision once it became apparent the plaintiff, who bore the greater proportion of fault, was not yielding as required. In reviewing the governing authorities and drawing in particular on what is often cited from Walker v. Brownlee, supra, Cartwright and Locke JJ. concurring at 460-461, the following was said:\n",
      "[25] A driver like the defendant, who is in a dominant position, will not typically be found to be liable for an accident. Drivers are generally entitled to assume that others will obey the rules of the road. Further, though defensive driving and courteous operation of motor vehicles are to be encouraged, they do not necessarily represent the standard of care for the purposes of a negligence action. A driver will not be held to have breached the standard of care simply because he or she failed to take extraordinary steps to avoid an accident or to show exceptional proficiency in the operation of a motor vehicle.\n",
      "...\n",
      "[23] This accident happened because neither driver saw the other before they collided. That was because both proceeded in a manner that contravened the provisions of the Act: Ms. Merrison breached s. 158 and Ms. Smeltzer breached s. 166. Ms. Merrison could not see Ms. Smeltzer's vehicle while she was wrongfully passing the cars and the truck ahead of her on the right and she was not looking where she should have been; Ms. Smeltzer could not see Ms. Merrison's car while her vision was obstructed and she did not take steps to ascertain her turn could be safely made. I do not consider it possible to establish different degrees of fault in the circumstances of this case such in accordance with s. 1 of the Negligence Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 333, liability is to be apportioned equally\n",

The roadway had three westbound lanes and parking was permitted in the curb lane. Immediately before the accident the plaintiff was cycling slowing toward the intersection in the curb lane to the left of parked cars. The defendant driver moved from the centre lane into the curb lane ahead of the parked cars without looking to her rear and noticing the cyclist. When she did, the plaintiff's bicycle struck the right front of the defendant's car\n",

      "61  In dismissing the action the trial judge in Jang held there was no basis for the defendant to expect a cyclist would come up as the plaintiff did, passing the line of parked cars with cars on his left that had stopped for the red light at the intersection. The Court of Appeal, however, disagreed. In reaching its conclusion the Court of Appeal held that, for a cyclist, a lane may be regarded as \"unobstructed\" for purposes of s. 160(1)(b) of the Act (now s. 158(1)(b)) if there is ample room between the parked cars and the marked lane line for a bicycle to pass freely\n",

      "62  Counsel for the defendants submits that Jang has been modified by the Court of Appeal's more recent decision in MacLaren v. Kucharek, . In MacLaren, the Court found a cyclist riding at the outer edge of a through lane in an effort to travel as near to the right as practicable was negligent because he failed to \"take a lane\" as he entered an intersection. Ryan J.A. stated as follows in this regard:\n",
      "[27] The appellant says that Mr. McLean was contravening s. 158 by riding to the right of the centre lane and passing, on the right, vehicles travelling in that lane. It was the appellant's position that none of the exceptions set out in s. 158(1) and (2) applied to Mr. MacLaren's situation.\n",
      "[28] The respondent argued that the appellant's proposed interpretation of s. 158 of the Motor Vehicle Act would lead to absurdities. I do not propose to analyze these arguments as it is unnecessary to determine whether s. 158 would permit Mr. MacLaren in this case to pass on the right. In my view it not so much that Mr. MacLaren was passing on the right when he was struck by the appellant, but that he was riding between what were effectively two lanes of travel before entering the Laurel Drive intersection. In my view, s. 183(2) (which required him to ride as near as practicable to the right side of the highway), did not authorize him to ride between two lanes of travel. For Mr. MacLaren to ride between two unmarked but commonly travelled lanes immediately prior to reaching the Laurel Drive intersection was dangerous because a northbound left-turning driver would have little opportunity to see him as he cycled alongside vehicles to his left. In my view, given the configuration of the roadway and the pattern of traffic in this case, for Mr. MacLaren to cycle alongside vehicles to his left created a danger both to himself and to the appellant.\n",
      "[29] While Mr. MacLaren did the right thing by moving out of the curb lane, he should have moved in behind the vehicles travelling toward the \"through\" lane, not beside them. By cycling between lanes Mr. MacLaren did not show sufficient care for his own person to avoid a finding of contributory negligence. Taking a lane was the only way, in my view, that a bicyclist could have satisfied the mandate of s. 183(2)(c) to safely travel as near as practicable to the right of the highway.\n",
      "[30] It cannot be said, based on the evidence at trial, that the decision of the trial judge that Mr. Kucharek was negligent in making his left-hand turn is unreasonable. The trial judge found that Mr. Kucharek completed his turn negligently by failing to ensure that there was no traffic approaching that would constitute an immediate hazard. In other words the appellant did not see the bicyclist, but had he exercised the required care, he should have. At the same time I am of the view that the trial judge erred in failing to conclude that Mr. MacLaren, in choosing to ride in between the two travel lanes and beside the stopped pick-up rather than in the lane of travel behind it, did not take reasonable care for his own safety. His failure to take reasonable care for his own safety was one of the causes of the accidents. Mr. MacLaren was therefore contributorily negligent\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  I do not agree with counsel that the broad principle stated in Jang has been modified by MacLaren. The issue in Jang was whether a commonly configured curb lane containing parked cars is \"unobstructed\" for a cyclist if there is ample room between the parked cars and the marked lane line to allow a bicycle to pass. In contrast, MacLaren concerned an idiosyncratically configured roadway with two de facto lanes and a right-turn-only lane at the intersection. In this factual context, the Court of Appeal in MacLaren found it was dangerous for a cyclist to cycle alongside vehicles to his left and fail to \"take a lane\". The Court did not comment explicitly or implicitly, however, on whether a curb lane with ample room for a cyclist to pass between parked cars and the lane line should no longer be considered a through lane for cyclists. In my view, the law in this regard remains as set out in Jang\n",

This is so, he says, because accidents that involve heavy commercial vehicles often result in great damage to persons and property. For this reason, the public is entitled to expect that huge trucks will be operated with extreme caution and vigilance by well-trained drivers. Understood in that context, the standard of care to be applied to Mr. Conarroe in this case is that of a reasonably prudent commercial truck driver. The standard of care to be applied to Mr. Nelson is that of a reasonably competent cyclist\n",

      "68  According to his counsel, Mr. Nelson conducted himself throughout in the manner of a reasonably competent cyclist and thus bears no responsibility for the Accident. He cycled through the Intersection on a green light in what was, for him, a through lane, taking into account the ample room available between the lane line and parked cars on both sides. In so doing, he rode as near as practicable to the right side of the highway as required by s. 183(1)(c) of the Act\n",

      "69  Counsel submits that but for Mr. Conarroe's negligence in failing to see Mr. Nelson before and as he turned right at an unsafe speed Mr. Nelson would have made it through the Intersection without incident. The fact that he did not was the result of Mr. Conarroe's obvious inattention as Mr. Nelson cycled along behind, then beside, the Truck and entered the Intersection, all in a through lane. In contrast, counsel for the defendants submits that Mr. Nelson is the author of his own misfortune and Mr. Conarroe is blameless in connection with the Accident. Mr. Nelson was in the servient position and in breach of s. 158 of the Act as he passed the Truck on the right. In support of this submission, counsel argues the curb lane on Hastings was not a through lane, as asserted by Mr. Nelson. Rather, he says, Mr. Nelson was cycling between lanes, as prohibited by MacLaren\n",

      "72  According to his counsel, Mr. Conarroe could not have anticipated that a cyclist would try to overtake him on the right in the prevailing circumstances. Nor could he, with reasonable skill, have taken steps to avoid the Accident once he became aware of Mr. Nelson's disregard of his right-of-way. For all of these reasons, counsel for the defendants submits that Mr. Nelson is the only party at fault for the Accident. That being so, he says the action should be dismissed\n",

      "75  The standard of care applicable to Mr. Conarroe was that of a reasonably prudent commercial truck driver having regard to all of the circumstances. In my view such a driver was obliged to exercise great caution when approaching, preparing for and executing a right turn on a green light at the Intersection, even if he was in the dominant position. In particular, such a driver was obliged to maintain a consistently high level of attention and vigilance throughout the entire period of approach, preparation and execution of the right turn in question. This is so because of the predictable presence of, amongst others, cyclists travelling in the adjacent curb lane, the Truck's many blind spots and the gravity of potential harm associated with a collision. In such circumstances, the possibility of danger emerging from the right was real and apparent\n",

      "76  The standard of care applicable to Mr. Nelson was that of a reasonably competent cyclist. In my view such a cyclist would pay close attention to the size, speed and possible course of travel of all vehicles in his or her immediate orbit. In particular, such a cyclist would not attempt to pass a large, slow-moving, right-turning truck on the right at the Intersection, even if the curb lane was, for cyclists, a through lane and the light was green ahead. This is so because such an attempt would be dangerous and leave little, if any, margin for error, with potentially devastating consequences. Put another way, such a movement could not be made safely and thus would amount to a breach of s. 158(2)(a) of the Act\n",

He was proceeding on a green light in the appropriate lane and had signaled his right turn well in advance. He had also looked around as he turned onto Nanaimo and, generally speaking, was entitled to assume that others would obey the rules of the road. Nevertheless, the presence of cyclists in the adjacent curb lane was both proper and predictable.

It would have been apparent that Mr. Nelson was focusing straight ahead and might attempt to overtake on the right as the two approached the green light, despite the riskiness of such conduct. Armed with this knowledge, Mr. Conarroe could have avoided the Accident by waiting to commence his turn in the Intersection until it was clear either that Mr. Nelson had abandoned the unfolding attempt to pass on the right or completed it successfully. His failure to do so was a failure to take reasonable care and a contributing cause of the Accident\n",

As noted, this was a breach of s. 158(2)(a) of the Act. It also fell well below the standard of care to be expected of a reasonably competent cyclist in all of the circumstances\n",

Ms. Leask's pick-up truck clipped the hind end of the mother moose with the driver's side mirror. The moose calf was hit by the right front corner of the pick-up truck and appears to have bounced off the right front quarter panel of the vehicle, smashing the right front headlights and buckling the front hood and right front quarter panel above the front wheel.

Thus, argues the plaintiff, the defendant driver did not do enough to avoid the accident and submits that a reasonable person would at least have stopped as quickly as possible in the circumstances, honked the horn, moved into the oncoming traffic lane, which was clear of any other traffic at the time or pulled to the right hand shoulder of the road.\n",

On the other side of the railway line there were trees and then the Skeena River. Ms. Leask wanted to stop and look at the moose calf and got out of the vehicle, but Ms. Racy screamed at her that the mother was still in the area and she returned to the truck\n",

      "21  Ms. Racy explained that when Ms. Leask returned to the truck, they set out again but she estimated they pulled over into the Kasiks Resort after about 5 minutes of driving as the vehicle was making an unusual noise. The cook at the lodge explained the kitchen had closed as it was after 8:00 p.m. when they arrived. They left their damaged vehicle at the Kasiks Resort and the cook gave them a ride into Terrace. None of the pictures in Ex. #1 depict the entry to the Kasiks Resort which Ms. Racy described as being \"down the road and around the bend.\n",

Later still in cross-examination Ms. Racy acknowledged that within 5 minutes of the collision they were at the Kasiks Resort and it was dark. She eventually agreed that if it was dark at the time of the collision she would be unable to see half a mile down the road and would only see what the vehicle headlights illuminated\n",

She testified in direct examination that she did not notice any braking activity or reduction in speed. In cross-examination, however, she acknowledged Ms. Leask did slow down and apply the brakes, but she did not know to what degree. She later testified she did not feel the brakes being applied and that the vehicle stopped when they hit the moose. Ms. Racy was reluctant to acknowledge that Ms. Leask had applied the brakes and repeatedly responded that Ms. Leask had not slowed down enough to allow the moose to cross the road\n",

There are no posted signs alerting drivers to moose in the area although she has seen one or two moose in the area since the accident. Ms. Leask described herself as a cautious driver who usually slows down to about 20 km/h below the speed limit when driving at night as it is difficult to see\n",

      "32  Ms. Leask recalled they left Prince Rupert for the drive back to the camp close to 6:00 p.m. When they left Prince Rupert it was still light out, but by the time they encountered the moose it was dark. Ms. Leask explained that the driving conditions for the highway were good: it was dry and there was no fog or rain. The posted speed limit in the area was 100 km/h\n",

      "33  Ms. Leask and Ms. Racy were talking. As the vehicle rounded a corner or bend in the road Ms. Leask saw two moose on the right hand side of the highway and they were moving. Ms. Leask recalled having her vehicle headlights on high-beam at the time. She immediately told Ms. Racy to \"hang on\" and was 95% sure she immediately applied the brakes to slow the vehicle down. Ms. Leask estimated she was driving at about 85 to 90 km/h when she rounded the corner and encountered the moose. She estimated the moose were about three to four car lengths away when she first saw them at the side of the road.

The moose calf was starting to head from the shoulder area of the road for the eastbound lane of traffic towards the lane of travel Ms. Leask was driving in. Ms. Leask explained she kept the vehicle in her lane of travel and under control to the best of her ability. She explained she was unable to swerve into the oncoming traffic lane as the mother moose was in it and she would have hit it head on. Ms. Leask also could not swerve to the right shoulder area as then she would have hit the moose calf head on with her vehicle. Furthermore, she was nervous that driving on to the shoulder of the highway at the rate of speed she was driving might result in her losing control of the truck and flipping it\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  Ms. Leask testified that she did not have much time to slow down as the moose continued to move and by the time she slowed the vehicle to about 25 or 30 km/h the moose were right in front of her with the mother having crossed the highway into the oncoming traffic lane and the moose calf moving from the shoulder towards their lane of travel. Ms. Leask clipped the rear end of the mother moose with the driver's side mirror and hit the moose calf around its neck or shoulders with the right front corner of the passenger side of the truck. She described the motion of hitting the moose calf as like an impact with a pillow\n",

      "36  After hitting the moose calf, Ms. Leask stopped the truck and wanted to check on it but remained in the vehicle at Ms. Racy's suggestion. Ms. Leask continued to drive, intending on returning to the camp, but the truck was making \"weird noises\" and so she pulled into the Kasiks Resort, which she estimated was anywhere from 300 metres to about one kilometre away\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  Ms. Leask was clear in her evidence that it was dark out at the time of the accident and as such neither she nor Ms. Racy were able to see beyond the reach of the headlights, let alone half a mile into the distance on the highway. Although inconsistent as to the time of their departure from Prince George as between her statement to ICBC and her evidence at trial, the inconsistency, given the passage of time, was not that significant, particularly as either departure time would have resulted in the area where the accident occurred being dark when they encountered the moose\n",

      "38  Ms. Leask took photographs of the area in January 2009 that were marked as part of Ex. #2. She marked on the photographs at Tab 7 and 8 of Ex. #2 the area where she first saw the moose. She explained that at the time of the accident, the trees depicted in the photographs still had their leaves and that the third photograph at Tab 8 of Ex. #2 showed tree stumps that were actual trees at the time of the accident but had since been cut down. The last photograph in Tab 7 was taken east of the entrance to the Kasiks Resort and depicts, far off in the distant background, the corner area where they encountered the moose\n",

      "39  Ms. Leask was cross-examined extensively including about her assumptions of rolling the vehicle if she slammed on the brakes notwithstanding the fact the vehicle was equipped with an antilock braking system and also about her certainty of applying the brakes. It was clear from her answers that the events happened very quickly and her natural reaction was to apply the brakes to the extent that she thought was appropriate for the circumstances she was faced with at the time. Although Ms. Leask agreed she might have been able to apply more force to the brakes, she did not know what the result would be and if that would result in a swerve in either direction from her line of travel\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "40  In cross-examination, Ms. Leask revised her estimate of time between first seeing the moose and hitting them from a couple of seconds to seven or eight seconds. Despite this revision, Ms. Leask maintained she did not have time to take other evasive measures apart from applying the brakes and slowing down. As best she could determine from the circumstances that confronted her, swerving in either direction from her lane of travel would have resulted in hitting either one or the other of the moose head on\n",
      "======\n",

      "41  Ms. Leask acknowledged she was aware of the potential danger of moose and wildlife in the area and reduced her speed to between 85 and 90 km/h, below the posted speed of 100 km/h, for that possibility of a night time encounter. Although she had her headlights on highbeam at the time she was driving, Ms. Leask was still surprised by the moose, which were located on the right hand side of the highway although not concealed by any of the surrounding brush\n",

Ms. Leask also explained that when she used the term corner she meant the bend in the road. Despite adopting her ICBC statement about where the accident occurred, Ms. Leask disagreed with the suggestion that Ms. Racy's photographs were more accurate in their depiction of the location of the accident on a long straightaway and reiterated her photographs more accurately depicted where the accident occurred.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "44  Mr. Lyman testified that the day after the accident, when Ms. Racy and Ms. Leask returned to the camp at Cranberry Junction, Ms. Racy came into the defendants' motor home, and briefly spoke with Mr. Lyman about the accident. Ms Racy told Mr. Lyman they had hit two moose on a corner and said, as she was leaving, words to the effect of \"if it was not for Grace's driving, we might not be here now.\" Ms. Racy then left the motor home\n",

However, Mr. Lyman did not appear to fully understand the import of the Rule 18A proceedings in July 2010, stating he did not really know why he travelled to Powell River in July other than he was told to be there for the application\n",

He explained he did not think about it until he walked out of the courtroom in July 2010 and then told both counsel of his recollection. He further explained he did not recall the other small talk in the conversation with Ms. Racy because the accident occurred in 2006 and he was not aware that he was being sued until almost a year later. When it was suggested to Mr. Lyman that the conversation did not occur, his reaction was swift and visceral: he testified he did not come all this way, which I took to mean travel from his home in Prince Rupert to the trial in Powell River, to make something up, that he would not make something like this up and added that the plaintiff and her partner are his friends and he does not like the situation he finds himself in.\n",

      "47  The evidence of Ms. Racy and Ms. Leask on the key factual points of location of the accident, lighting conditions and distance between the moose and the vehicle when the moose were first sighted conflicts and must, therefore, be scrutinised with particular care. The credibility of each should be analysed, taking into account the following test for the assessment of credibility of interested witnesses as stated by words of O'Halloran J.A. in Faryna v. Chorny,  (B.C.C.A.) at 357:\n",
      "The credibility of interested witnesses, particularly in cases of conflict of evidence, cannot be gauged solely by the test of whether the personal demeanour of the particular witness carried conviction of the truth. The test must reasonably subject his story to an examination of its consistency with the probabilities that surround the current existing conditions. In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those condition\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  The primary difficulty presented in this case is the seemingly unreliable recollections of the parties involved, no doubt given the passage of time between the accident and the trial nearly four years later. This difficulty is highlighted by the lack of agreement as to where exactly the accident occurred, the difference in the perspectives provided by the photographs adduced by each side, the significant delay between the accident and the taking of any photographs of the area in issue, and the absence of any depiction in the photographs of the actual bend or corner in the highway that was rounded immediately prior to encountering the two moose\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "49  I do not find either Ms. Racy or Ms. Leask to be lying about the events, but both witnesses were unreliable in their recollection as to where precisely they were on the highway, relative to the photographs, when they first encountered the moose at the side of the road. The lack of reliability and clear recollection is in part the product the lack of need to pay close attention to their surroundings and what was going on immediately before encountering the moose, coupled with the intervening passage of time since the accident. The unreliability of their recollections is no doubt heightened by the following facts: (1) it was dark by the time they encountered the moose; (2) the incident happened quickly; (3) they did not remain at the scene of the accident but moved on to the Kasiks Resort; (4) neither party appears to have endeavoured to solidify in their memory the precise location of the accident until many months after the accident when they each returned to the scene to take photographs of it 48 months (Ms. Racy) or 27 months (Ms. Leask) after the incident; and, (5) neither party included a depiction of the bend or corner they both acknowledge rounding before encountering the moose\n",

Ms. Leask's photographs are to the west of the 100 km/h speed limit sign depicted in Ms. Racy's photographs. Ms. Racy acknowledged that her photographs do not depict the corner they rounded. It is evident, however, from Ms. Leask's photographs, especially those at Tab 8 of Ex. #2, that there is a slight bend in the road in the foreground that then straightens out at the location Ms. Leask indicates as where the moose were sighted and started to cross the highway\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "51  The photographs in Ex. #1 and Ex. #2 provided by the parties assist in showing the general location and physical layout of the area of highway but neither set of photographs depict the actual corner or bend in the road the vehicle came around when the moose were encountered\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "52  What is clear from the evidence of both parties is that the two moose were encountered after rounding either a bend or corner in the highway. Ms Leask's immediate reaction was to issue a warning to Ms. Racy to hang on because there were moose at the side of the road just ahead of them. The area where they encountered the moose was a remote location of the two lane highway with a small paved, and then gravel, shoulder, trees and bush, a small ditch (in the area of the posted speed sign), a railway track and the river all to the right of the east bound vehicle. To the left of the centre line was the oncoming traffic lane, then a paved and gravel shoulder, trees and bushes, possibly a ditch and then a hillside area\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "53  Given the time of year, the fact that they were driving in a mountainous area, had left Prince Rupert close to 6:00 p.m, and had to have travelled for at least an hour to make it to the vicinity of the Kasiks Resort, 60 km west of Terrace, I find Ms. Racy is mistaken in her assessment of the lighting conditions and the ability to see the moose half a mile away. Ms. Racy acknowledged in cross-examination it was dark by the time they stopped at the Kasiks Resort for help and that this stop occurred within minutes of the impact with the moose and was less than a kilometre away\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "54  Based on the totality of the circumstances, I find that Ms. Leask's collision with the moose occurred sometime after 7:00 p.m. on October 18, 2006, and that it was dark at the time. Ms. Leask was driving east bound on Hwy #16 and travelling between 85 and 90 km/h - 10 to 15 km/h an hour less than the posted speed limit of 100 km/h\n",
      "======\n",

      "55  There was little in the way of traffic on the stretch of road where the collision occurred. The road conditions were dry. Photographs taken of the vehicle in the Kasiks Resort parking lot the next day establish the trees still had their leaves\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "56  I find that Ms. Racy, based on her own admission, was not paying any particular attention to the surroundings or what was going on during the drive until her attention was drawn to fact that there were moose up ahead and told to hang on by Ms. Leask. Although Ms. Racy believes she saw the moose half a mile down the road, that would be a physical impossibility as it was dark at the time in an area devoid of artificial lights that could illuminate the surroundings\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "57  It is clear from Ms. Leask's evidence that the best she could do was only roughly estimate distances and time involved between her first sighting of and then collision with the moose. This is not surprising given the circumstances of rounding a bend or corner in the road and encountering wildlife on the side of the road. Her focus no doubt was on how to address the emergency she was confronted with and how best to respond to it. It is clear from Ms. Leask's evidence, which I accept, that events happened very quickly and, despite trying to be prepared for wildlife on the highway by reducing her speed, she nevertheless was surprised by seeing the moose in the beam of her headlights as she rounded the bend or corner of the road\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "58  Ms. Leask was very familiar with the road in question, as she drives it on a regular basis and has done so for a number of years. There are no posted signs for moose in the area, although Ms. Leask was aware that moose had been sighted in the area on a previous occasion. She had not seen any moose in the area before the accident, and maybe only one or two since the accident. Nevertheless, she was aware of the possibility of wildlife on this stretch of highway. Ms. Racy does not drive, and did not pay attention to whether there were signs about moose in the area. It is clear that although the area might have wildlife from time to time, it is not a \"moose alley\" area\n",

      "\n",
      "60  Ms. Racy testified that as they came around the bend, Ms. Leask said \"moose, hang on,\" and she braced herself by grabbing the handle above the passenger door.

      "61  I accept Ms Racy saw the moose before the impact occurred but, because it was dark at the time, she could not have seen them half a mile away and that in fact they were much closer than what she believes they were and what she testified to. As it was dark, the moose would only be visible in the headlight area of Ms. Leask's vehicle, a considerably shorter distance than half a mile. Accordingly, I cannot rely on Ms. Racy's estimation that the moose were half a mile away when she first saw them. She would only be able to see what was illuminated by the headlights\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "62  Ms. Racy's positioning of the moose on her photographs in Ex #1 also gives me pause as to the accuracy and reliability of her observations and recollection. On photograph #3 she marked where the two moose were said to be standing when she first saw them. Her positioning of them at the time of impact has them travelling a fair distance west on the shoulder of the highway towards the 100 km/h sign and is inconsistent with the evidence that the mother moose moved across the road from where Ms. Racy says she originally saw them\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  I do not find Ms Racy to be lying on this point but simply mistaken, and therefore unreliable, as to where the accident occurred and how quickly or slowly it occurred. Ms. Racy never went back to the scene of the accident until she took her photographs in October 2010\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  Ms. Leask's evidence is that as she rounded the bend or corner in the road, well in advance of the 100 km/h sign, she saw the moose and immediately told Ms. Racy \"moose, hang on.\" At the same time, she applied her brakes but did not slam them on and slowed down as best she could. She testified that within a matter of a couple of seconds they were \"on the moose,\" and by then the mother was across the truck's lane of travel and into the oncoming traffic lane. The calf was starting to cross the road from the right hand side shoulder. By the time Ms. Leask made contact with the calf she estimated she had slowed to around 25 kms\n",

      "65  Ms. Racy did not recall any evasive action being taken by Ms. Leask and that she continued to travel straight ahead and slow down. In cross-examination she agreed Ms. Leask applied the brakes, just not enough given the distance she says the moose were from the vehicle. She then contradicted herself and said she could not say if Ms. Leask applied the brakes. When it was suggested in cross-examination that Ms. Leask applied the brakes and slowed down but did not slam on the brakes, Ms. Racy replied that she was not paying attention to that and had in her mind that Ms. Leask should have been slowing down more. Given her inconsistency on the application of the brakes and her acknowledgement that she was not paying attention to that, I find that serves to further undermine her reliability as to what she saw, when she saw it and how long she had to observe it. I find Ms. Racy's recollection of the events of how much time there was to stop between seeing the moose and the collision with the moose to be, in all the circumstances, unreliable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "66  Ms. Leask explained she did not have time to take evasive action; she simply slowed and applied her brakes, but did not slam on the brakes as she did not know whether they might have ended up in the ditch or what would happen to them. She explained she continued to travel in her lane straight ahead because she felt if she swerved to the right she would have hit the calf head-on and if she had swerved left into the oncoming traffic lane she would have hit the mother head-on. She denied she had lots of time to slow down and explained she did not drive on the shoulder as she believed, in addition to hitting the moose calf, she could have flipped the truck, given the speed she was initially travelling at\n",

      "67  Ms. Leask endeavoured to slow her vehicle and not hit either moose, but testified she did not have enough time to take any other measures or steps. Ms. Leask did not slam on her brakes, notwithstanding the anti lock brake system, as she was not sure what the result would be in doing that either. Ms. Leask believed she did the best she could in the circumstances she was confronted with as she rounded the corner\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  Given my finding Ms. Racy is mistaken as to the lighting conditions and what she observed in terms of distance to the moose when they rounded the corner, I am not satisfied that it is more likely than not that the moose were a significant distance from Ms. Leask's vehicle when they rounded the corner\n",

      "\n",
      "69  Although the vehicle sustained about $3,500 in damage, the photograph of the truck shows that there was no damage to the windshields. The damage was confined to the right passenger side area of the hood, extending from the headlights along the right front passenger side panel and the outer hood line to the area over the right front passenger wheel. The damage depicted is consistent with Ms. Leask's account that she slowed down significantly and had to be travelling no more than 30 km/h when she hit the moose calf, causing the limited damage to the hood and right front quarter panel area of the vehicle. It is also consistent with her evidence that she could not swerve to the right or left as moving right and to the shoulder would have put the moose calf more head on with the centre part of the vehicle, and moving left would have put her head on with the mother moose. As it was, she clipped the rear end of the mother moose and the glass on her driver's side outside mirror was broken\n",

      "70  Ms. Leask was extensively cross-examined, including on her assumptions about deployment of the driver side air bag and rolling her vehicle if she slammed on her brakes at 90 km/h. She acknowledged these were assumptions that she just knew but did not have anything to confirm her beliefs. Despite the vigour of cross-examination and the somewhat combative nature of some of her responses, Ms. Leask remained unshaken on her evidence that the incident happened so quickly she simply reacted and did not have time to fully consider other approaches or manoeuvres. Ms. Leask expanded her estimate of time from sighting to impact from a couple of seconds to seven or eight seconds. Despite this, she remained steadfast that if she had swerved into the oncoming traffic lane she would have hit the mother moose head on and if she had swerved in the opposite direction to the shoulder she would have hit the moose calf head on and possibly have gone into the ditch\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  The thrust of Ms. Leask's evidence, both in direct and cross-examination, was that the events happened quickly and she had little time to react before her vehicle collided with the two moose. She saw the moose as she rounded the bend, they were illuminated by her high beam headlights and not concealed by the brush as they were on the shoulder of the road and continuing to move onto the road when she first saw them. She applied the brakes of her vehicle as she thought appropriate in the circumstances. She reacted immediately, kept her vehicle in its lane of travel and did not have any time to consider anything else apart from determining in that quick assessment that if she swerved in either direction from her lane of travel she would have hit one or other of the moose head on. In the end, Ms. Leask appears to have tried to \"thread the needle\" by going between the two moose, avoiding potentially more catastrophic results if she had swerved to either side\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "72  While it is regrettable that Mr. Lyman did not mention the conversation with Ms. Racy the day after the accident at an earlier point in the litigation process, I do not find that he has made this conversation up. While demeanour evidence is not determinative of credibility, it can at times assist in the assessment of credibility. This is one of those times. I accept Mr. Lyman's evidence that the conversation did occur and that Ms. Racy made the statement about Ms. Leask's driving that Mr. Lyman attributed to her. I accept that at the time the statement was made, before litigation was anticipated or initiated, it did not seem particularly important to Mr. Lyman, he was simply concerned about the well being of Ms. Racy and his partner\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "73  The meaning of the conversation is another matter. Given the surrounding circumstances and the continued friendship of the parties, I find that Ms. Racy's comment about Ms. Leask's driving was made in the context of expressing relief at how Ms. Leask handled the situation she was confronted with when the moose were sighted as she rounded the bend or corner in the highway\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "74  Of significance to my conclusion that Ms. Leask's account of the events is the more accurate one is the fact that Ms. Leask, immediately upon seeing the moose, made the comment of \"moose, hang on.\" If the moose were much farther up the highway as Ms. Racy appears to believe, there would have been no need for a warning to be given. Ms. Leask's warning to Ms. Racy to hang on is more consistent with the preponderance of the surrounding circumstances that they were almost upon the moose when Ms. Leask first saw them as they rounded the corner or bend in the road.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "75  The first issue to be addressed is whether there was negligence on the part of Ms. Leask in relation to her collision with the two moose\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "76  Counsel for the plaintiff argues that by driving too fast for the conditions of a remote location known to have moose in the area, coupled with failing to apply the brakes more quickly and failing to take any evasive action and by hitting both moose, a presumption of negligence arises that the defendant must discharge\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "77  Counsel for the defendants and the third party argues that this is not a case of prima facie negligence but rather a case of a reasonable person confronted with an emergency situation and to which she responded as best she could in the circumstances. In the alternative, counsel argues that if this is a case of prima facie negligence then the defence of explanation as provided by Ms. Leask is such that it amounts to an explanation as to how the accident could have happened without negligence on her part\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "78  In support of his argument that liability has been established, counsel for Ms. Racy relies primarily upon the following cases: Baker v. Russell,  [Baker]; Freidooni v. Freidooni,  [Freidooni]; McLean v. McLeod,  (Co. Ct.) [McLean]; and, Perry v. Banno  (S.C.) [Perry]. In addition, he has cited reference to s. 144 of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 318 (careless driving), as well as extracts from the Canadian Encyclopedic Digest (Western), 3d ed. vol. 22 (Toronto, ON: Thomson Reuters Canada Ltd., 1973-current) at s. 332, s. 335 and s. 343\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "79  In support of his argument that Ms. Leask is not liable for the accident when she collided with the moose on Hwy #16, counsel for the defendants and third party relies upon the following cases: Perry; Gauthier & Company Ltd. v. His Majesty The King,  [Gauthier]; McLean v. Weir and Goff  (C.A.) [Weir]; Lynch v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia  (C.A.) [Lynch]; Babich v. Maxwell  (C.A.) [Babich]; Fontaine v. British Columbia (Official Administrator)  (S.C.C.), aff'g  (C.A.) [Fontaine]; Pitts Enterprises Ltd. v. Farkes et al, , aff'd  [Pitts Enterprises]; McIntosh v. ICBC and Mauer, , aff'd  [McIntosh]; Singleton v. Morris,  [Singleton]; and, Fajardo v. Horianopoulos,  [Fajardo]. In addition he has cited reference to extracts from Linden, Allen, Canadian Tort Law (4th edit.), (Toronto, ON: Butterworths, 1988) at pp. 115-120 and The Canadian Encyclopedic Digest (4th ed.) Western vol. 42 Title 109 Negligence (Carswell: February 2009) at pp. 132-135, s. 42 to s. 50\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  A number of the authorities cited address accidents occurring as a result of collisions with wildlife, especially moose. As noted by Madam Justice Ross in Fajardo at para. 24 \"... whether a driver is negligent when [s]he runs into wildlife on the road depends on the circumstances of the particular case.\" In Pitt Enterprises (C.A.) at para. 5, Mr. Justice Donald noted that while negligence may be presumed by driving in the wrong lane, it is not necessarily presumed where a driver strikes wildlife in their ordinary lane of travel (see also Pitt Enterprises (B.C.S.C.) at para. 17)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "81  Of course, to rebut any presumed inference of negligence the defendant need only advance an explanation of how the collision may reasonably have occurred without negligence on the part of the driver. If the explanation is equally consistent with negligence and no negligence, then the burden of establishing negligence remains with the plaintiff: Pitt Enterprises (B.C.S.C.) at para. 12-13, (B.C.C.A.) at para. 5; Singleton at para. 38; Fajardo at para. 22 citing Gauthier, Lynch and Perry\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "82  In this case, Ms. Leask was travelling in her own lane of travel when she encountered the two moose at the side of the road after rounding a corner or bend in the road. She did not end up in the oncoming traffic lane. She had little time to react. The two moose continued to move towards the travelled portion of the highway from the shoulder area. Ms. Leask adopted a course of action she felt presented the least amount of risk in the circumstances, by applying her brakes but not slamming them on and by not swerving in either direction and thereby hitting one or other of the moose head on. Ms. Leask's explanation offered in this case, if an explanation is necessary, argues her counsel, is that the moose were moving onto the highway as she rounded the bend in the highway and there was not enough time to do anything other than what Ms. Leask did, especially considering that she was already travelling at a rate of speed below the posted speed limit\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  In this case, the presumption of negligence does not arise and the onus remains on the plaintiff to establish negligence on the part of the defendant. The issue then is whether the plaintiff has proven on a balance of probabilities the defendant was negligent in operating her vehicle when it struck the two moose\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  To establish negligence, plaintiff's counsel argues the want of care demonstrated by Ms. Leask is established by her failing to brake more quickly and failing to react in a fashion of either slamming on the brakes, stopping, moving to the left or right or honking her horn, as well as travelling too quickly in an area where it is likely that wildlife will be encountered on the road. Counsel's argument is, in part, predicated on acceptance of Ms. Racy's belief that it was still light enough to see the moose half a mile away and that was how far away the moose were when first sighted. I have found, however, that it was dark when the collision occurred and the moose would not have been visible until captured by the beams of the headlights of the truck. Ms. Racy's estimate that the moose were half a mile away when first sighted has been rejected\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  In support of his argument of negligence, counsel for the plaintiff relies upon Baker. In that case, the Newfoundland Court of Appeal overturned the trial judge's dismissal of the plaintiff's action and found the defendant driver negligent. The circumstances in Baker are distinguishable to the case at bar. In Baker the defendant was driving on a straight stretch of a divided highway at dusk when he encountered two moose, one standing on the shoulder of the highway and one in his lane of travel. The defendant swerved to the left, braked and almost immediately hit a third moose which the defendant had not seen and that had come from the centre median. His passenger, the plaintiff, was seriously injured when the vehicle hit the third moose. The area the defendant was driving in was posted with reflective moose warning signs and it was well known to have moose in the area, particularly in the fall, which is when the accident occurred. However, the driver did not recall seeing the sign. Significant to the Baker case was the expert evidence on lighting conditions, lines of sight and distance to travel to stop at various rates of speed. The defendant was found to have been travelling at 90 km/h at the time of impact with the moose and had testified he was travelling at 100 km/h when he first saw the moose\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  The Court of Appeal in Baker found the moose warning sign to be a pointed warning of an enhanced risk that a serious hazard may materialize. In allowing the appeal, the Court found the trial judge committed palpable and overriding error in how the issue of speed and the presence of moose warning signs were addressed. The failure of the defendant to reduce his speed appreciably from the posted highway speed upon entering the moose warning area, in circumstances where the prevailing conditions at the time of the accident included the highway being wet, diminishing light and the presence of the moose warning sign, were found to create an unreasonable risk of harm to his passenger. The Court of Appeal found the respondent was negligent in his manner of driving when he encountered the moose\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "87  In the case at bar, Ms. Leask was driving below the posted speed limit, there is a complete absence of expert evidence as to lighting conditions, stopping times and distances and the encounter with the moose was not in an area posted with moose warning signs and not in a \"moose alley\" area\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "88  The plaintiff's counsel also relies upon Freidooni to support his argument of negligence on the part of the defendant. In Freidooni, the defendant husband was found negligent and liable for the injuries his wife sustained when he struck a deer at 7:30 a.m. on a July morning while driving in the fast lane of a divided highway where the posted speed was 110 km/h. The defendant was driving at a 130 km/h with the vehicle's cruise control activated. The defendant, who was listening to music and drinking coffee, never saw the deer, only a shadow coming from the right of the vehicle, and thus did not apply the brakes or take any evasive action before hitting the deer. The accident occurred in an area known to have wildlife and the defendant was aware of this fact. The trial judge in Freidooni found that the reason the defendant failed to see the deer was that he was not paying attention and in that respect he was negligent given the circumstances and conditions of the highway and the defendant's knowledge that wildlife frequented the area\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "89  Freidooni is distinguishable for the fact that the defendant was driving in excess of the speed limit in an area known to have wildlife and he simply failed to pay attention to the surrounding circumstances, instead drinking coffee and listening to music and letting the vehicle drive on cruise control. Ms. Leask, on the other hand, was driving at a reduced speed limit, paying attention to the highway conditions and upon seeing the moose responded by applying the brakes and reducing her speed as best she could in the circumstances\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "90  In McLean, the defendant was found negligent for failing to reduce his speed when he first saw what he thought was a buggy on the road and pulled to the left to pass it without reducing his speed. When the defendant got closer to the object, still travelling at his same rate of speed, he realized it was a herd of cattle. He slammed on his brakes but by then it was too late and he hit four or five animals. The cattle driver and his assistant escaped injury only because they jumped off the highway to avoid the defendant's vehicle. McLean too is distinguishable as the driver failed to respond appropriately when he first observed the unknown object on the road. In finding the driver negligent, Lindal C.C.J. stated as follows:\n",
      "[17] There is a duty on the driver of a motor vehicle, who is driving at night, to take special precautions the moment he sees an object in front of him. In this case the defendant should have released the accelerator at once, placed his foot on the brake and reduced the speed of the car so as to be ready to meet any emergency. This he did not do, but merely-assumed that what was in front of him was a buggy and that he could pass it without slowing down. It is true that a few moments afterwards he changed his mind and slammed on the brakes, but then it was too late. Not only has the defendant failed to discharge the onus upon him, the evidence establishes negligence in him\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "91  In the case at bar, however, Ms. Leask responded immediately upon seeing the moose and took precautions. She warned Ms. Racy and she slowed down by applying her brakes, responding to the circumstances that confronted her as best she could\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "92  The case of Perry which the plaintiff's counsel relies upon is altogether different from the case at bar. In Perry, the accident occurred on the Oak Street Bridge in Vancouver. The defendant was driving his vehicle northbound in the centre lane when it crossed into the oncoming southbound lane of traffic. The defendant's vehicle struck a truck travelling in the centre southbound lane of traffic. The driver of the southbound truck, upon seeing the defendant's vehicle drift into his lane of travel, took evasive action trying to pull into the curb lane of travel and struck another vehicle. The defendant argued he lost consciousness at the moment his vehicle started to drift into the oncoming traffic lane. Extensive medical investigations failed to identify any reason for a loss of consciousness. Mr. Justice Brenner (as he then was) found there was a total absence of any objective evidence to support a loss of consciousness by the defendant. The evidence was found to be equally consistent with the defendant suffering a momentary lapse in attention caused by his hearty laughter to his daughter's joke. The defence of loss of consciousness failed and the defendant was unable to prove that the accident could not have been prevented by reasonable care on his part\n",

      "93  Two cases more similarly situated to the circumstances of the case at bar can be found in the decisions in Pitt Enterprises and Fajardo\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "94  In Pitt Enterprises, the defendant, who was driving a tractor trailer at night on a two lane highway, struck a moose standing in his lane of travel. The collision with the moose rendered the steering mechanism of the defendant's vehicle inoperative and he crossed the centre line from his northbound lane of travel into the southbound lane. The defendant's vehicle collided head-on with the plaintiff's southbound vehicle. The collision occurred at night and the defendant was unable to take any evasive action when he first saw the moose 20 yards away from his vehicle. The defendant was driving approximately 90 to 95 km/h in a 90 km/h zone. The trial judge accepted the defence of explanation that the defendant ended up on the wrong side of the road because his steering mechanism was rendered inoperative after striking the moose. Accordingly the onus remained on the plaintiff to establish that the defendant was negligent in operating his vehicle when it struck the moose\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "95  In Pitt Enterprises, Powers J. found the defendant driver did not lose control of his vehicle due to excessive speed. Rather, he was unable to see the moose within enough time to stop his vehicle. Moreover, the area was not a \"moose alley\" or \"moose crossing area.\" As the trial judge found at para. 32 \"[t]he defendant, in the agony of the collision, made the decision that it was less likely to result in injury if he simply hit the moose head-on, rather than taking evasive action. This is not a case where the driver has lost control of his vehicle due to excessive speed.\" An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "96  In Fajardo, the defendant was driving at night, northbound on the highway near the Terrace-Kitimat airport. His vehicle struck a moose. The force of the collision caused the defendant's vehicle to stop. The body of the moose was thrown into the southbound lane of travel. The plaintiff, also driving northbound, came upon the scene and took action to avoid hitting the defendant. He swerved into the southbound lane and collided with the moose\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "97  The area of the accident in Fajardo, although near a moose warning area was found not to be within the \"moose warning zone.\" The defendant, who was found to be travelling at 90 km/h, 10 km/h below the posted speed, had slowed his speed for the hill and the patchy fog that had developed that night. As soon as the defendant saw the moose he applied his brakes, but not sufficiently to avoid colliding with the moose. The trial judge accepted the defendant's explanation of the moose darting out onto the highway and, despite his efforts to avoid a collision, it could not be avoided, finding it to be equally consistent with negligence and no negligence. The defendant in Fajardo was found not to be negligent either in his rate of speed for the conditions or failing to see the moose earlier than he did\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "98  In Fajardo at para. 32, Ross J. stated:\n",
      "32 In Pitt Enterprises, Mr. Justice Powers cited with approval Maksymetz v. Plamondon  (C.A.) [Maksymetz] and Tabaka v. Greyhound Lines of Canada Ltd.  (Q.B.) [Tabaka]. In Maksymetz, Monnin C.J.M., speaking for the majority, stated the following at paras. 8-9:\n",
      "I am of the view that requiring a driver to reduce his speed much below the posted speed limit because of the threat of the sudden appearance on the highway of a large animal, such as a moose or a deer, directly in front of a moving vehicle travelling with dimmed headlights is too high a standard to set for driving on Manitoba roads, especially those in remote areas of the province. That is not a standard which should be set by this court.\n",
      "What happened was so sudden that defendant could do nothing to prevent the moose from hitting the hood of his tractor-trailer. The action of the moose was the sole cause of the accident and could be termed an act of God.\n",
      "Tabaka was to the same effect\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "99  And in Pitt Enterprises, Powers J. referred to the principles from Tabaka stating at para. 24:\n",
      "Tabaka v. Greyhound Lines of Canada Ltd., . In this case, a Greyhound bus collided with a mother and calf moose on Highway 16 just past Mount Robson Park gates. It was approximately 2:20 a.m. This was a summary trial. At [paragraph] 9, the trial judge outlined what he referred to as principles as follows:\n",
      "Based on the jurisprudence, I am of the view that the following are the applicable principles with respect to claims of negligence due to motor vehicle accidents involving wildlife:\n",
      "* Requiring a driver to slow down to well below the posted speed limit because of the possibility that wildlife may appear on the highway is too high a standard to set for drivers: Maksymetz\n",
      "* Some of the factors that are relevant in considering whether the conduct of a driver is negligent include: road conditions, weather, condition of the vehicle, experience, reaction to the risk presented, any evasive action taken, familiarity with the road, the intensity of the vehicle's headlights, other traffic on the roadway, condition of the tires, speed: Favel, ; Birk,  and Curbello, ;\n",
      "* There is no requirement that a driver must drive at a speed that would enable him to bring his vehicle to a standstill without collision after the driver, keeping a reasonable lookout, sees a stationary object in front of them: Cooper , citing Masten J.A. in McCannell v. McLean,  (Ont. C.A.), aff'd, ,  (S.C.C.)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "100  In this case, Ms. Leask acted immediately and appropriately upon first encountering the moose. Upon rounding the bend or corner in the road and seeing the moose, she gave a warning to Ms. Racy and at the same time applied the brakes to slow the vehicle as best she could without risking swerving in either direction. The two moose were not standing in the lane of travel but were moving toward it from the shoulder on the right hand side of the highway. The road conditions were dry. It was dark, and thus the moose were not half a mile away as Ms. Racy estimated. Rather, they were caught in the range of the headlights. There is no evidence as to what the range of the headlights on high beam for this model of vehicle is in this case. Ms. Leask was driving at least 10 km/h below the posted speed limit and was in all likelihood travelling at a speed of between 85 and 90 km/h. Ms. Leask reduced her speed to take into account the driving conditions including the fact that it was dark and the possibility of encountering wildlife\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "101  Significantly, and as in Pitt Enterprises and Fajardo, there is no evidence of what speed Ms. Leask would have to have been travelling at to have been able to stop her truck once the two moose became visible to her. Nor is there any evidence as to how far the defendant's lights would have illuminated the highway in this case, something available in the case of Pitt Enterprises\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "102  In addition, the collision in this case did not occur in an area that could be described as a \"moose alley\" where it is more probable than not that moose will be found. While an accident may have occurred a year before in the same general area where a driver struck a moose, there is no other evidence to suggest this is an area where it is more probable than not that moose will be found. Ms. Leask was aware there might be wildlife in the area and had adjusted her speed accordingly and was wary of the possibility\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "103  As soon as Ms. Leask saw the moose she applied her brakes, but not with enough force to completely avoid colliding with the moose. I accept her evidence that the moose were fairly close to the vehicle, within the beam of the vehicle headlights, when she first encountered them and that they continued to move from the shoulder area to the vehicle's lane of travel. Despite her efforts to avoid a collision by applying the brakes and maintaining a straight path, instead of swerving in either direction, the collision with the moose calf could not be avoided.\n",

      "104  Considering all the circumstances in this case, I conclude that the collision with the moose was not occasioned by any negligence or want of care on the part of Ms. Leask. I find that Ms. Leask was not driving at an excessive speed given the conditions. I also find that she was not negligent in failing to apply the vehicle brakes more forcefully or in failing to take any other evasive action such as pulling or swerving to the right or the left of her lane of travel. To have done so no doubt would have resulted in much graver consequences: a head on collision with either the mother moose or the calf. The plaintiff has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities the defendant was negligent in her response to seeing the moose on the highway.

      "15  Mr. Moss is originally from Ontario, where he completed grade 11. In 1997, he moved to Edmonton. Mr. Moss developed an addiction to illegal drugs, in particular to crack cocaine. He has been clean and sober since December 2006. In order to maintain his sobriety and dependent upon his work schedule, he attends Narcotics Anonymous (\"NA\") meetings two to four times a week. He has a criminal record which involves convictions for theft-related offences\n",

      "18  He stated that he heard that there were workers needed for a chicken farm minutes before the vehicles arrived at the NLM to pick up the workers. He was standing outside the NLM when a truck with a canopy driven by a female arrived. People were getting into the truck and it filled up. Mr. Moss paid little attention to the truck. A minivan came along driven by an older man, who has been identified in this trial as Fred Goossen. Mr. Moss stated that two vehicles pulled up at the same time as he was waiting for a ride up to the chicken farm, and that both the truck and the minivan were being loaded at the same time in the presence of Annie and Mr. Goossen. Mr. Moss testified that he jumped into the back seat of the minivan. He had a seatbelt. After the minivan filled up with workers, they drove to the chicken farm. It took about 30 minutes\n",

He observed the driver of the truck at the passenger side and back end of the truck. Mr. Moss identified Annie as the driver of the truck at this trial. Annie stated, \"Get in the back of the truck or you're fucking walking\". When he was getting into the pickup, he noticed Annie was unhappy. Mr. Moss described Annie's body language as sharp and aggravated. He did not know where Mr. Goossen was. The cab of the truck was full, so he sat at the back of the box on the passenger side. He stated that one more person got in the box of the truck after he did and before Annie closed the tailgate and canopy of the truck. The truck left two minutes later. He estimated that there were six to nine people in the box of the truck\n",

      "25  At the time of the accident, he had been on the streets for seven years. In his situation, he would not even consider protesting a ride in a pickup truck. He was poor and addicted to drugs. I conclude that Mr. Moss would not have approached Mr. Goossen about riding in the back of the pickup truck. Mr. Moss lacked confidence and felt shame, which prevented him from protesting about riding in the back of the truck\n",

All he heard from the conversation was that Annie had to drive them home, she was tired and voices were raised. Annie then came out of the barn, went to the truck and said, \"Get in the fucking truck. I'm going to make one trip back.\n",

      " Q  Okay. Could you see them while they were arguing or could you just hear it? \n",
      " A  Passing by I believe it was like an entrance area or something and we all have to pass that area to come out and they were bickering back and forth. I just went outside for a cigarette to see what vehicle I'm going to squeeze into. \n",

His next recollection is being in and out consciousness, the paramedics, and being in the hospital in Kamloops. He was eventually moved to the hospital in Kelowna. He summarized his injuries as severed tendons in his right hand, injuries to his fingers, a neck fracture, and bruises\n",

This is not something he thought about on the night of the accident and before he got into the pickup truck. Mr. Proulx stated that the trip going up was safe, and he expected to return home safely. He had no money or other means for alternate transportation. He felt he was \"between a rock and a hard place\". I conclude he had no other option.

She testified that she told the workers that she was leaving and that she was taking only one trip, although she did not recall saying, \"Get in the fucking truck; I'm only taking one trip.\" Annie stated that she would not have used profanity in front of her grandfather. Nor did she remember telling them that they would be walking if they did not get in the truck. She stated that she would not have made them walk, as her grandfather was still there. Two of the workers in the truck were going somewhere other than the NLM, so she told them to get out as she was only going to one place. They exited the vehicle and two other workers took their place\n",

The truck was about 30 to 40 feet from the barn with all the workers either already in the truck or getting into the truck. Her aunt's truck was beside hers or about 10 feet away, and Ms. Ebl was standing beside the truck. Annie testified that she asked Ms. Ebl to take some of the workers, but her aunt refused because she did not want her truck \"full of shit.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "206  Annie testified that she felt pressured into driving the workers. In her examination-in-chief, she stated that the pressure initially came from Ms. Ebl the night before, after her mother refused to drive. She said that she also felt pressured by her grandfather because he needed the help. She said that she felt pressure from the workers because they had been promised work. She stated that when it came time to go back to the NLM, it was part of the favour/agreement. In Annie's May 30, 2007 examination for discovery, she provided the following evidence:\n",
      " Q  So there are various comments in here including some attributed to you and I just want to get your direct evidence on this, you agreed to transport these people as a favour? \n",

Like it's, I don't know, it was just there was nothing in return, there was nothing like oh well I'll let you do this if you help me. It was nothing. It was just a favour.

      " Q  So we are doing our best verbally to reconstruct this accident which I know happens in a couple of blinks of an eye. So you recollect that at least one tire gets into the gravel portion of the righthand side of the road as you're going down? \n",
      " A Yes. \n",
      " Q So tell me what you recollect after that? \n",
      " A  I remember the truck kind of catching and like you know, fishtailing and I tried to correct it and I over corrected because it went back on the road like it should have and then I don't know, I was in a mad panic I guess and I over corrected and ended up in the ditch. \n",
      "...\n",
      " Q  All right. It's what we call a multiple rollover. It rolls over more than once, true? \n",
      " A  True. Now that could have been just because like it felt like it rolled over that many times. I don't know how many times it rolled over. \n",
      " Q  But would it be fair to say that you do know that it rolled over more than once? \n",

      "210  The particular portion of the road where the accident happened was windy and the posted speed limit was 50 kilometres per hour. Annie acknowledged that she was driving over the speed limit. She guessed that she was driving 60 kilometres per hour. At trial, she again conceded that she came into the curve too quickly, tried to correct the truck after it started to fishtail, and went into the ditch\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "211  Annie stated that Burke Schulz then kicked out the windshield. After she got her foot unstuck from the brake and undid her seatbelt, she left the truck and ran up the bank to her grandfather. She whispered to him that she had crashed the truck, as she did not want anyone to hear. She thought she had killed someone. She got into her grandfather's van. They went to his home and called 9-1-1. They then drove back to the scene of the accident. She recalls hearing someone shouting \"Fuck you, you stupid fucking bitch\". She stated that she did not mean to hurt anyone. Throughout this period of time, Annie was very emotional. All the adult members of the family, including her mother, gathered at the scene of the accident.\n",

Once a year he was required to arrange for the old hens to be culled and replaced. On November 1, 2006, the old hens were culled. After that date, the barn was cleaned and readied to receive the new hens. On November 17, 2006, workers were transported to the Knutsford farm to place the new hens in cages. In order to complete the task, Mr. Goossen hired 30 to 32 workers to help\n",

      "214  In order to attract workers, the poster was placed in the NLM, the Miracle Centre and an apartment building on Singh Road. The workers were to be paid $10.00 per hour. Those working only on November 17 were to be paid immediately after completing their work; those who intended to work the next day would be paid after they completed their work the next day. In order to pay the workers, Mr. Goossen obtained the cash from his bank account and Sunshine would reimburse him. When members of the Goossen family worked, their pay was the same\n",

      "215  There were no vehicles provided by Sunshine for use at the farm or for transporting workers. Rather, members of Mr. Goossen's family used their own vehicles for transporting workers. No one was paid for the service or reimbursed for gas or any other kind of expense\n",

Mr. Goossen stated that there were no rules about transporting workers, but it was presumed they would be transported safely. About a year before the accident, his daughter, Mrs. Browne, had transported workers in the box of her pickup. The principal of Sunshine, Mr. Dawood Alibhai, told Mr. Goossen that this practice was not to happen again. Mr. Goossen, at a family dinner, informed family members that this could not occur in the future. Present at the dinner were himself, his wife, his daughter, Ms. Ebl, and her husband, and his other daughter, Mrs. Browne.

      "218  Mr. Goossen stated that while he was transporting workers, he did not see his granddaughter at any of the centres where workers were being picked up. Mr. Goossen understood that Annie had made two trips to the barn to deliver workers, but he was \"not sure\"\n",

      "221  In his examination-in-chief, Mr. Goossen provided his version of the conversation between he and his granddaughter as follows:\n",
      " Q  And then, did you have any discussion with your granddaughter Adrianna, just before or at any time before she left the barn to transport workers back, if she -- did she transport workers back? \n",
      " A  She transported workers back. She took one trip and it ended shortly. But yes. \n",
      "...\n",
      " Q  All right. And did you have any discussion with her before that occurring? \n",
      " A  Yes, I wanted her to take two trips and she didn't want to, she was tired and had a long day. And I said, \"Fine, take one trip. Take only the guys that you can in the truck and deliver them, drop them to the Mission and go to only one place, in the Mission only. And I'll look after the rest.\" \n",
      "...\n",
      " Q  My learned friend keeps interrupting my -- my examination. Could you repeat what you said to her? \n",
      " A  I said to her take only what you have seats for in the truck. And then that was -- that was where it was left and she was sent and left. And I was dealing with workers at the -- in the barn, inside of the office. You know, so I have no idea what happened after that, she went out. \n",
      " Q Did you talk to her about seatbelts in the truck? \n",
      " A  By saying for the seats you have, naturally it's seatbelts. \n",
      " Q  And then what was your plan then after she took the one trip? What were you going to do then? \n",
      " A  Well, I was going to call my wife who was at home and say, \"Take my truck and take another trip for me.\" which we did.\n",

Was it the first version of the discussion when you said essentially only take what you can get into the truck? Or it was the second version after my friend asked you what did you mean by that, when you said only take what you have seats for? Which version is the true version of what you said? \n",

      " THE CLERK: You're reminded of your affirmation. \n",

      "260  It was winter, and the defendant did not intend on driving a long distance. The court found the plaintiff had no control over who the driver invited to ride in his car. Mr. Justice Hinds stated:\n",
      "[22] On the evening of January the 8th, 1982 the plaintiff was at the Langley Hotel drinking beer. She was then just over eighteen years of age. The defendant, Randy Donze, entered the beer parlor and he and the plaintiff each consumed one beer. They went in the defendant Donze's motor vehicle to a party at the equestrian centre, a short distance north of Langley where they stayed for approximately one and a half hours. When they left the party, after midnight, there were four occupants in the motor vehicle. There were two young men in the back seat. The plaintiff in the front passenger's seat, and the defendant Donze was driving. They were returning towards the centre of Langley. Donze stopped and picked up two more young men. One got in the back seat. The plaintiff slid over and sat on the console located between the two bucket seats which were positioned in the front of the car. The other young man sat in the passenger bucket seat in the front of the car. There were seatbelts for the two bucket seats, but there was no seatbelt provided for a person such as the plaintiff who sat on the console.\n",

      "[24] ... I do not consider it would be realistic for the plaintiff to have refused to have sat on the console, or to have got out of the car when Mr. Donze stopped to pick up the two additional passengers. It was not unreasonable for the plaintiff to have moved from the right bucket seat and to sit on the console despite the absence of an available seatbelt for a person sitting in that position. Under the foregoing circumstances, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent with respect to the injuries she received in the accident as a result of sitting on the console where no seatbelt was available for her to wear: See Bissky v.

      "In order to establish contributory negligence the defendant must prove two elements: first, that the plaintiff's conduct showed a want of reasonable care for his own safety which caused or rendered the injuries more serious and, secondly, that had he conducted himself in a reasonable manner his injuries would have been avoided or lessened ... No such evidence was presented here. ...\n",
      "I believe that riding in the back of the Blazer was the only realistic alternative the plaintiff had for returning from Vancouver to White Rock. The issue, of what are realistic alternatives, has been dealt with by this court. In Bissky v. Trottier et al. the plaintiff was seated on a cushion on the centre console of the car and as a result of the accident was very seriously injured. It was argued that the plaintiff had been contributorily negligent in sitting in a position where no seatbelt was available to him. It was held that the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent as he had not been aware when he departed Vancouver that he would end up riding on the console. That eventuality did not present itself until another party decided to accompany them on their trip to northern British Columbia. Once he did, one party's ownership of the car and the passenger's large size relegated the plaintiff to his position on the console. it was reasonable for him to elect to sit on the console, despite the absence of restraints in that location, rather than refuse to continue the trip. If the plaintiff had refused to occupy the console his only alternative would have been to return to Vancouver by bus with his baggage and rifles.

      "[30] It is the value of individual responsibility which underlies, in my respectful view, the fifth element of the cause of action of negligence identified by Professor Fleming in his text The Law of Torts, (6th ed, 1983). The first four elements are (1) the existence of a duty, (2) a failure to conform to the standard required, (3) a reasonably close causal connection between the conduct and the resulting injury, and (4) actual loss or damage. To this Professor Fleming adds a fifth element: (5) the absence of any conduct by the injured party which would preclude him from recovering. Within this element is subsumed the concepts of contributory negligence and voluntary assumption of risk.\n",
      "[31] Conduct is negligent when it creates an unreasonable risk of harm. In determining this issue the law is asked to balance the danger created against the social value or utility of the activity.\n",
      "[32] The standard of care required of an injured party is no different than that required of a defendant. Put simply, each person must act reasonably to ensure their own safety, as they must to ensure that of others\n",

      "Sunshine sought workers who were residing in shelters by posting notices of the work. This was not the first time that they relied on such individuals;\n",
      "Mr. Goossen, the manager of Sunshine, was familiar with homeless people. He thought that in hiring these people, he was doing a kindness;\n",
      "Mr. Goossen and his family worked alongside these workers. On the evening of November 17, 2006, Annie, Mr. Goossen and Ms. Ebl performed the same tasks as the plaintiffs, and at the same rate of pay;\n",
      "The farm on which the work was done was in an unincorporated area, having no public transportation, no street lights, or sidewalks;\n",
      "On the evening of November 17, 2006, when the workers were to return home, it was late (after 11 p.m.) and dark and cold;\n",
      "The workers were poor. Most were homeless, on social assistance, and addicted to drugs or alcohol, or both. One plaintiff had a mental health condition for which he was medicated\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "285  I reject the evidence that Annie was speeding on her way to the farm. None of the workers who said that she was speeding stated how they came to this conclusion\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "286  Each of the plaintiffs worked for about three hours. Mr. Goossen told the workers that the work was finished. He paid cash to some of the workers and postponed the payment of the workers who were coming back the next day\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "287  Before the workers left the farm, a conversation occurred between Annie and Mr. Goossen. Parts of the conversation were overheard by the workers. Those parts were not exactly the same, but were consistent as to what took place between Annie and her grandfather, as stated in their evidence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "288  The defendants claim that Mr. Ficarini overheard the whole conversation and adopt what he said, except for that part of the conversation where Annie used the words, \"one fucking trip.\" Mr. Ficarini, at trial, said he overheard the conversation between Annie and her grandfather when he was in the barn. At his examination for discovery, Mr. Ficarini stated the conversation took place when he was getting into the truck. He also stated at that time that he caught the tail end of the conversation. Various workers overheard parts of the conversations. Others heard none of the conversation, but observed that an argument had occurred between Mr. Goossen and Annie and that they were unhappy\n",

      "290  I conclude that it had come to Mr. Goossen's attention that Annie had driven up to the farm with the workers in the box of the truck. That is what Mr. Goossen wanted to address in his conversation with Annie. Mr. Goossen told Annie that she should take two trips, whereupon Annie responded by saying she was taking \"only one fucking trip.\" She had to drive home and she was tired\n",
      "======\n",

      "291  Probably the most reliable version of the conversation comes from Mr. Goossen and Annie. Mr. Goossen had difficulty recalling the exact words of the conversation. Annie acknowledged that her grandfather told her she should take two trips to the NLM. Annie said she was only going to take one. I find that she knew her grandfather wanted her to transport the workers safely; that is, all wearing seatbelts\n",

Annie knew that when she told her grandfather she would make only one trip, her grandfather then said, \"I will take the rest.\" I also find that Annie knew that her grandfather expected her to take the workers in the cab of the truck and only so many as there were seatbelts. Her responses to the questions posed to her at her examination for discovery confirm this. I do not accept her explanation that the questions were confusing\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "293  After the conversation with her grandfather, it was obvious to the workers that Annie was in a bad mood and that she was in a hurry.

Section 96 [a provision corresponding to the current s. 254] provides that it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board to determine whether persons are workers or employers within Pt. 1 of the Act.\n",

It is, with respect, not a part of WCAT's jurisdiction under the Act to determine if an action commenced in this court is statute barred although that may be the end result of the findings they are empowered to make.\n",

These issues, and others, are properly within the jurisdiction of this court to be determined.\n",

The WCAT has determined that Adrianna Browne, although a worker employed by Sunshine Eggs Inc., was not acting in the course and scope of her employment, within the meaning of the Act, when the accident occurred. The question becomes whether the Plaintiffs' claim is barred by section 10(1) in all of these circumstances. Section 10(2) provides that where the cause of injury is such that an action lies against some person, other than an employer or worker within the scope of this part, the worker or dependent may claim compensation or bring an action.

      "A master is not responsible for a wrongful act done by his servant unless it is done in the course of his employment. It is deemed to be so done if it is either (1) a wrongful act authorised by the master, or (2) a wrongful and unauthorised mode of doing some act authorised by the master. Although there are few decisions on the point, it is clear that the master is responsible for acts actually authorised by him: for liability would exist in this case, even if the relation between the parties was merely one of agency, and not one of service at all. But a master, as opposed to the employer of an independent contractor, is liable even for acts which he has not authorised, provided they are so connected with acts which he has authorised that they may rightly be regarded as modes -- although improper modes -- of doing them. In other words, a master is responsible not merely for what he authorises his servant to do, but also for the way in which he does it\n",

      "360  Sunshine referred to Randhawa v. Cowick, . Randhawa was an off-duty police officer at a club incorporated under the Society Act. The club had one of the individual defendants temporarily acting as a doorman for which he was compensated by a limited allowance for drinks. An altercation occurred between the doorman and the plaintiff who fell down the stairs. The society was sued. Mr. Justice Drake concluded that the relationship of master and servant was appropriate to apply in this case. Mr. Justice Drake said the following:\n",
      "...In my view, he was more than a mere volunteer, as the club to some slight degree recompensed him for what he did by the provision of refreshments gratis.\n",
      "In a case of this kind, there is no difference, so far as effect in law is concerned, between the relationship of master and servant and that of agency. As Chief Justice Duff pointed out in Lockhart v. Stinson & CPR, :\n",
      "\"If the servant commits the wrongful act, in respect of which the master is charged, within the scope and in the course of his agency, (in the sense in which these words are used and understood in the law) then it is immaterial that he is acting, in fact, against his master's interests and for his own convenience and benefit.\"\n",
      "The question is whether or not Cowick was acting within the scope of his employment when he failed in his duty of care to the plaintiff. There are limits to the scope of an agent or servant's employment: if the servant's tortious act is entirely unrelated to his employment, then no liability therefore can attach vicariously to the master. Authorities for this proposition are legion: see for example Lockhart v. Stinson & CPR, op. cit., and the recent case of Miller v. Lougheed Ventures Ltd.,  (C.A.011749).\n",
      "In this case, Cowick's tort was not unrelated to his employment as doorman of the club for the evening in question. His negligence was the sort of thing which could foreseeably happen, given the small size of the landing and the position of the stairs leading to the club premises; unfortunately in this instance, the consequences of this foreseeable misfortune were serious.\n",
      "The club's exposure to liability, then, is established, prima facie, by its relationship to Cowick, the Occupier's Liability Act and the common law. But whether or not liability attaches in the circumstances here, is another matter.\n",
      "To say that an occupier's duty of care to patrons of its premises, members of the club in this instance, extends so far as a positive requirement that it guard against accidents which it is in the circumstances powerless to prevent, seems to me to carry the extent of its duty to impossible lengths\n",

In 1974, Mr. Dhillon purchased the residential property at 520 East 57th Avenue, Vancouver (\"the 57th Avenue property\") using his own money. The 57th Avenue property was registered in Mr. Dhillon's name.

      "\n",
      "4  Mr. and Mrs. Dhillon and their children resided in the 57th Avenue property as their matrimonial home for a number of years. In the mid-1980s, Mr. and Mrs. Dhillon experienced marital difficulties. By 1985, the marriage was at an end although the parties did not formally divorce. Mr. Dhillon moved back to India, his and Ms. Dhillon's country of origin. Ms. Dhillon and the four children continued to live at the 57th Avenue property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "5  On January 23, 1992, Ms. Dhillon signed a contract to sell the 57th Avenue property. The contract described Ms. Dhillon as the vendor and provided for a completion date of January 31, 1992. As stated, Mr. Dhillon, and not Ms. Dhillon was the registered owner of the 57th Avenue property. Sometime prior to January 23, 1992, Ms. Dhillon and Manohar Dillon participated in the creation of a fraudulent power of attorney which purported to authorize Ms. Dillon to sell the 57th Avenue property and receive the proceeds of sale on behalf of Mr. Dhillon. Mr. Dhillon's signature on the power of attorney was forged. He had never seen the document or authorized Ms. Dhillon to sell the 57th Avenue property\n",

The purchasers took action against Mr. Dhillon and were granted an order for specific performance in default of Mr. Dhillon's appearance. Ms. Dhillon, claiming the status to represent Mr. Dhillon on the basis of the fraudulent power of attorney, retained the defendant, Jalel Jaffer (\"Mr. Jaffer\") to attempt to set aside the vesting order made earlier in default of Mr. Dhillon's appearance.

Part of the money judgment awarded to Mr. Dhillon against Ms. Dhillon included compensation of $12,540.77 for another fraudulent transaction, in which using a second fraudulent power of attorney, Ms. Dhillon fraudulently withdrew $12,540.77 from accounts of Mr. Dhillon at Vancouver City Savings Credit Union (\"VanCity\").

At first Mr. Dhillon lived for brief periods of time with family members. He even camped in the hallway of a pizza restaurant owned by a family member in exchange for working there as well. He also lived in an apartment that was part of a cedar mill. In 2004, Mr. Dhillon brought his four children by his partner in India to Canada. With them, he lived in a succession of rented accommodations until he and the children were finally able to occupy the 52nd Avenue property in March 2008 upon the expiry of a stay imposed by the Court of Appeal\n",

      "16  At the point that title vested in him, the 52nd Avenue property was subject to a substantial mortgage that was in arrears. The home had been left in a dirty and damaged condition as well. Mr. Dhillon had to negotiate with the mortgage holder, Royal Bank of Canada (\"RBC\"), to bring the mortgage into good standing. Ms. Dhillon had apparently purchased the 52nd Avenue property in 1997 for $390,000, subject to a $290,000 mortgage to RBC. When the property vested in the name of Mr. Dhillon, the mortgage balance was still substantial ($221,000 as of June 2008). Mr. Dhillon had to pay just over $44,600 to reinstate the mortgage. He also paid just over $3,800 to bring the municipal taxes into good standing. What Mr. Dhillon paid to RBC apparently included almost $24,500 left over on a line of credit secured against the home\n",

      "17  In March 2009, RBC started foreclosure proceedings. According to Mr. Dhillon, RBC would not accept payments from him when he attempted to make them. Mr. Dhillon obtained another mortgage and paid out RBC. An appraisal of the 52nd Avenue property by Calvin Lai of Campbell & Pound Ltd. as of September 1, 2008, was placed into evidence by Mr. Jaffer. It was Mr. Lai's opinion that as of that date, the 52nd Avenue property had a market value of $680,000. An assessment roll report showed the property as having an assessed value of $492,000 in 2005 and $640,000 in 2007. There is no evidence of the value of the 57th Avenue property in 2005 or 2008 from which to make a comparison nor any evidence as to what might have been owing on any mortgage against the 57th Avenue property at those times, had it not been sold\n",

There was no evidence as to what type of home Mr. Dhillon would have purchased in September 1993 with the proceeds of the sale of the 57th Avenue property, what such property would have been worth in July 2005 when Mr. Dhillon received title to the 52nd Avenue property, nor what amount of additional money Mr. Dhillon may have had to borrow to make such an investment. However, there is evidence from Associated Economic Consultants Ltd. that a detached home in East Vancouver with a sale price of $197,000 in 1993 would have increased in value, on average, to $292,700 by July 2005 (a factor of 1.486) and to about $529,000 by August 2012. No figures were given for 2008\n",

There is no evidence of whether Mr. Dhillon taxed any of the costs he has been awarded and, if so, the results. Mr. Jaffe sought to introduce certain evidence of accounts billed to Mr. Dhillon by him as well as by another lawyer who originally had conduct of the fraud action, and by yet a further lawyer who acted for Mr. Dhillon in a Family Relations Act,  (\"FRA\") proceeding brought by Ms. Dhillon.

The trial judge found that Mr. Jaffer had unwittingly taken steps on the instructions of persons who were acting fraudulently, but he was unaware of the fraud of Ms. Dhillon and Manohar Dhillon and his own intentions were entirely honest.

      "[21] The appellant claims damages from the respondent on three alternative causes of action:\n",
      "breach of contract on the footing that the appellant was the respondent's client;\n",
      "negligence -- the respondent's failure to fulfill a duty of care to the appellant as a non-client; or\n",
      "breach of respondent's fiduciary duty to the appellant.\n",
      "[22] The trial judge found that the appellant was not the respondent's client and accordingly there was no duty of care or fiduciary duty. She did not analyze the non-client issue.\n",
      "[23] In my opinion, the trial judge erred in failing to determine whether the respondent owed the appellant a duty of care as a non-client and in making an unreasonable finding that reliance on the reasons in the vesting order judgment did not fall below the standard of care of a reasonably competent solicitor. It is my view that the respondent owed a duty of care to the appellant as a non-client and that he failed in that duty by depriving the appellant of the proceeds of sale. In the circumstances, no competent solicitor could have interpreted those reasons as judicial authority directing the transfer of the whole of the putative family asset from one spouse to another without notice or trial.\n",
      "[24] As I would allow the appeal on this ground and grant judgment in favour of the appellant, I do not find it necessary to deal with breach of contract or fiduciary duty\n",

      "24  He also noted, at para. 27:\n",
      "[27] I propose to analyze the case on the law of negligence. The trial judge found that the appellant was not the respondent's client and that the respondent was not aware of Mrs. Dhillon's fraud, nor should he have been. These are findings of mixed fact and law and I am not prepared to interfere with them\n",

      "25  In his closing submission to me, counsel for Mr. Dhillon acknowledged that the Court of Appeal had not made an \"express\" finding that Mr. Jaffer had breached a fiduciary duty to Mr. Dhillon. Mr. Justice Donald specifically said that he did not need to deal with the ground of appeal that Mr. Jaffer had breached a fiduciary duty to Mr. Dhillon. As counsel for Mr. Dhillon stressed to me, there are consequences if the breach of the duty of care found by the Court of Appeal was \"fiduciary in nature\" as the onus of proof would then shift to Mr. Jaffer to disprove causation. Counsel referred to B.S.A. Investors Ltd. v. D.S.B.,  [B.S.A.], where Madam Justice Ryan wrote, at para. 49:\n",
      "[49] Finally, I note that there is a body of law, still extant in this province, standing for the proposition that the onus of proof is reversed on the issue of causation once the plaintiff has established solicitor's negligence: Begusic v. Clark, Wilson & Co.  (S.C.). However, those cases may be limited to situations where the breach of a lawyer's duty is fiduciary in nature: Shiokawa v. Tohyama  (C.A.). As this issue was not raised or argued before the court, nothing in these reasons should be taken as a consideration of this question\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  Begusic was a case involving a suit by a client against her own lawyer in which the negligence of failing to advise of a rent revision provision in the head lease of a co-op unit she had purchased would have been a breach of the lawyer's fiduciary duty to her\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  In Shiokawa, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from a trial judge who had dismissed a third party claim against lawyers who had placed a mortgage against property of an innocent party on behalf of a fraudster employing a forged power of attorney. The lawyer had been asked by the credit union which advanced the mortgage money to ensure that the power of attorney was satisfactory to the transaction. The lawyers also acted for the fraudster, although they were not aware of the fraudulent nature of the power of attorney\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  Chief Justice Finch wrote the reasons for the Court. After concluding that the lawyers had not breached any duty to report to their clients (the credit union), he went on to deal with both breach of fiduciary duty and, in obiter, causation. It was the latter part of his reasons to which Madam Justice Ryan referred in B.S.A. The comments of the Chief Justice are helpful:\n",
      "[54] In some cases, a lawyer's fiduciary obligations to a client will require the lawyer to make full disclosure of all material information \"in order that the client may properly make decisions in respect of the matter upon which he is retaining the solicitor\" (Jacks v. Davis  (B.C.C.A.) at 357). However, as in Jacks, the circumstances leading to a breach of fiduciary duty usually includes the solicitors having a personal interest in the client's business. (See also, Commercial Capital Trust Co. v. Berk  (Ont. C.A.).)\n",
      "[55] Where a lawyer with no personal interest in the matter does not alert a sophisticated client about information outside the scope of the retainer, and nothing else indicates that the client is relying on the lawyer for that information, the lawyer will not be in breach of a fiduciary duty: Cox v. Pemberton, Holmes Ltd.  (B.C.C.A.). As noted by Gibbs J.A. in Cox, the sophisticated lender, seeking the execution and registration of a mortgage, \"could not be said to be vulnerable or at the mercy of the third party law firm except in the performance of the contract of retainer\" (para. 17).\n",
      "[56] In this Court's recent judgment in 3464920 Canada Inc. v. Strother, , , Madam Justice Newbury cited with approval the case of Clark Boyce v. Mouat, [1993] 4 All E.R. 268 (J.C.P.C.) in which the Committee said this:\n",
      "That a solicitor owes a fiduciary duty to a client is not in doubt. The classic case where the duty arises is where a solicitor acts for a client in a matter in which he has a personal interest. In such case there is an obligation on the solicitor to disclose his interest and, if he fails so to do, the transaction, however favourable it may be to the client, may be set aside at his instance. ... Another case of breach is where a solicitor acts for both parties to a transaction without disclosing this to one of them or where having disclosed it he fails, unbeknown to one party, to disclose to that party, material facts relative to the other party of which he is aware. A fiduciary duty concerns disclosure of material facts in a situation where the fiduciary has either a personal interest in the matter to which the facts are material or acts for another party who has such an interest. It cannot be prayed in aid to enlarge the scope of contractual duties. Thus, there being no contractual duty on Mr. Boyce [the solicitor] to advise [the client] on the wisdom of entering into the transaction, she cannot claim that he nevertheless owed her a fiduciary duty to give that advice. Furthermore, any duty of disclosure can only extend to the solicitor's knowledge of facts and not to his lack of knowledge thereof. [at 275; emphasis of Finch C.J.]\n",
      "[57] I agree with this statement of the law. It applies in this case. I have already concluded that there was no breach in contract or tort. The Credit Union, a sophisticated lender, was not vulnerable to, and did not rely upon the lawyers, outside the scope of the retainer. There was no conflict between the interests of the two \"clients\" concerning the validity or authenticity of the power of attorney. And there was no conflict between the interests of the lawyers and either client on those matters. In \"not disclosing\" to the Credit Union the matters said to give rise to suspicion, the lawyers were not favouring the other client over the Credit Union. Nor were they protecting, or advancing, any interests of their own.\n",
      "[58] The alleged breach of fiduciary duty is not supportable.\n",
      "[59] In my opinion, the Credit Union has failed to establish that the lawyers were in breach of their retainer, in breach of their general duty of care, or in breach of any fiduciary duty arising in these circumstances. In my view, the action should have been dismissed on that basis, and I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.\n",
      "C. Causation\n",
      "[60] In view of my previous conclusion, it is unnecessary to address the issue of causation. However, because the matter was argued at length before the trial judge, and dealt with both in written submissions and orally before us, I will express my views.\n",
      "[61] The issue as to who bore the onus of proving causation arose because in his first reasons the learned trial judge held, relying on Heywood v. Wellers, [1976] 1 All E.R. 301 at 307 (C.A.), that causation should be assumed:\n",
      "[61] I agree with those contentions. The circumstances surrounding the Special Power of the substitute powers did suggest that further inquiry would have been warranted. The inquiries were not made. It should be assumed that if the inquiries had been made, it would have been effective to prevent this loan transaction from proceeding.\n",
      "[62] It was on this issue that the lawyers asked and received leave to have the case reconsidered by the trial judge.\n",
      "[63] On appeal, the Credit Union maintains that the lawyers bore the onus of disproving causation between the lawyers' alleged breach of duty and the Credit Union's losses. But this argument is premised on the breach of duty being fiduciary in nature. At para. 78 of the appellant's factum the Credit Union submits:\n",
      "The undisturbed findings of fact with respect to the Solicitors' breaches further support that critical information and advice was not provided by the Solicitors to Pacific Coast. The Solicitors, purporting to act in a joint retainer relationship, were aware of their high threshold duty of disclosure as between their two apparent clients and, in fact, Tohyama signed the \"conflict letter\" affirming such. The failure to disclose material information to Pacific Coast pertaining to the various surrounding circumstances relating to the proffering of the substitute documents was a breach of fiduciary duty owed by the solicitors to Pacific Coast. In matters of breach of fiduciary duty, causation is to be determined with the full benefit of hindsight. Wilson J. erred by not adopting this approach.\n",
      "[Canson Enterprises Ltd. v. Boughton & Company, ]. And see further para. 82 of the appellant's factum:\n",
      "It is self-evident in the chain of causation that the withholding of material information by Adair from Pacific Coast, and the failure to provide appropriate advice to Pacific Coast was the causation for reliance by Pacific Coast on Adair's subsequent representation that the mortgage was a first financial charge on the Property. While Pacific Coast approved the Loan based on the Special POA, it did not advance the funds until the Solicitors affirmed the placement of security.\n",
      "[64] On my view of this case, any liability on the lawyers could only have arisen in contract, or for breach of the common law duty of care owed in providing a professional service. In those circumstances, the onus of proving a causal relationship between the breach and any loss would have remained on the party advancing the claim. (See Graybriar Industries Ltd. v. Davis & Co.  (B.C.S.C.) at 181.) The burden of proving causation rests with the plaintiff absent valid policy reasons to displace it: Canadian National Railway Co. v. Rainbow Industrial Caterers Ltd.,  at 14-15. There are no policy reasons such as existed in Rainbow Industrial Caterers to displace the burden in the present case.\n",
      "[65] In his second reasons for judgment, at para. 35, the trial judge said:\n",
      "Pacific Coast made its own assessment of the bona fides of Mr. Tohyama and Mr. Cherneske, and its own assessment of the authenticity of the special power of attorney produced by Mr. Tohyama. On the basis of its own assessment, it decided to commit to a loan. There is no evidence that it conducted any independent inquiry to support its own assessments. Absent the benefit of hindsight, it does not necessarily follow that had the solicitors sought further instructions, Pacific Coast would have resiled from its initial assessments of Mr. Tohyama and Mr. Cherneske and their documentation.\n",
      "[66] In my view, the learned trial judge did not err in reaching this conclusion.\n",
      "[My emphasis in para. 63\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  It is not clear to me whether the Chief Justice meant by his statement in para. 63 of Shiokawa that the argument respecting the onus of proof on causation was \"premised on the breach of duty being fiduciary in nature\" referred only to the specific argument then being advanced on appeal, or more generally in the sense of such an argument must necessarily be premised on a solicitor's breach of duty which is fiduciary in nature. However, given that the onus of proof respecting causation is only displaced in exceptional circumstances (see Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke, , ), it seems reasonable that the onus of proof should remain with the claimant in a solicitor's negligence case unless there is shown to be a breach of fiduciary duty\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  This present case has come before me to assess damages on the basis of facts found by another trial judge and a determination by the Court of Appeal of how the law applies to those facts, at least respecting Mr. Jaffer's duty to Mr. Dhillon, a non-client. The trial judge found there was no breach of fiduciary duty. The Court of Appeal did not deal with the ground of appeal which asked for a determination that there was\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  An assessment of damages is not the forum to determine issues of liability. The question of whether Mr. Jaffer's negligence amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty is a question of liability, not of damages. If it was important to Mr. Dhillon that the issue of whether the negligence of Mr. Jaffer was in essence a breach of a fiduciary duty owed to Mr. Dhillon (for the objective of shifting the onus of proof on causation to Mr. Jaffer), then he should have gone back to the Court of Appeal to either ask that the Court of Appeal determine that issue, or remit the question to the trial judge to be decided in light of the Court of Appeal's judgment on breach of duty of care to a non-client. But at this point, it is not for me to determine whether the breach of Mr. Jaffer's duty to Mr. Dhillon was fiduciary in nature\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "32  Thus, the onus of proof rests with Mr. Dhillon to demonstrate that but for the negligence of Mr. Jaffer, he would not have suffered any given loss for which he claims.\n",
      "III. ASSESSMENT OF DAMAGES\n",
      "1. The Proceeds of Sal\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "33  Mr. Jaffer received into his trust account from the sale of the 57th Avenue property the sum of $187,201.18. From this sum, he paid his own account for $5,034.16 and the balance of $182,166.50 to Ms. Dhillon. The vesting order gave Mr. Jaffer the authority to approve the statement of adjustments. The order stated that the costs of the purchasers on the specific performance action were to be were to be deducted as were Ms. Dhillon's costs of trying to set aside an initial interim vesting order\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  The Court of Appeal said that Mr. Jaffer's failure in his duty to Mr. Dhillon as a non-client deprived Mr. Dhillon of \"the proceeds of sale\" (para. 23). In my view, the proceeds from the sale of real estate is what a vendor can expect to receive after payment of closing costs attributable to the vendor. In this case, the matter was complicated by the fact that a court order directed that certain costs (those of the purchasers and those of Ms. Dhillon) be deducted. . The real estate person's commission was paid, as it always must be. Thus, what Mr. Jaffer received into his trust account on September 30, 1993 is, I find, what he was obliged to account for to Mr. Dhillon, namely, the sum of $187,201.18. Mr. Jaffer was not entitled to deduct his fees from that amount without Mr. Dhillon's authority. The court order gave him no authority to deduct his fees. Similarly, the court order gave him no authority to pay the balance to Ms. Dhillon. But for the sums deducted, there was court ordered authority\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  The defence, however, says that given the parties' lengthy marriage and the 15 years she had spent working, raising their children, paying the mortgage and maintaining the home while Mr. Dhillon was in India and paying no support, Ms. Dhillon had a family law claim to an interest in the proceeds of the sale of the home, probably in the range of 50%\n",
      "PERCENT MENTIONED\n",
      "['50%']\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  Undoubtedly, a number of judges along the path of the lengthy litigation road Mr. Dhillon has gone down have thought so too. Thus, the comments sympathetic to Ms. Dhillon by the judge who heard the application for a vesting order in the original action for specific performance. As well, although it dismissed the appeal in the fraud action, the Court of Appeal granted a stay of execution on the portion of the judgment granting restitution and disgorgement remedies, so that Ms. Dhillon could bring a family law action to claim an interest in the proceeds of sale of the 57th Avenue property which was the matrimonial home, (including, presumably a claim against the 52nd Avenue property which she acquired with part of the proceeds of sale). Ms. Dhillon did start such an action but did not proceed with it\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  In the context of the present action, however, this argument by Mr. Jaffer amounts to a jus tertii defence. Had Ms. Dhillon proceeded with a family law claim, she may or may not have been successful. It is hard to conceive how she would not have been on the evidence before me. But what other evidence may have been before a court hearing such a claim is speculation on anyone's part\n",

      "[51] In determining disputes between two parties regarding personal property it is the relative nature of title that is important. All that needs to be determined is as between the two parties which one has a superior claim to the item. Sometimes one party will try to prevent the other party from obtaining possession of a good by arguing that a third party has a superior right to the item. This is referred to as the jus tertii defence. However, it generally does not matter if a third party to the action has a superior claim to both parties unless one party is acting as an agent of the true owner\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  Thus, Mr. Jaffer cannot rely in his defence on the argument that Ms. Dhillon may have had a good claim against part of the proceeds of the sale received by him\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "40  In the result, I conclude that Mr. Dhillon is entitled to judgment against Mr. Jaffer for the $187,201.18 which he received into his trust account on behalf of Mr. Dhillon.\n",
      "2. Loss of Opportunit\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "41  Mr. Dhillon's position is that, had he known in 1993 that the 57th Avenue property had been sold and had he then had access to the proceeds of sale, he would have used them to purchase a residence in Vancouver at an advantageous time in a rising market. Thus, a house with a sale price of $187,200 in 1993 would have been worth about $278,200 in 2005 using the 1.486 growth factor provided by the Associated Economic Consultants Ltd. Mr. Dhillon was successful in getting a vesting order for the 52nd Avenue property in 2005 although with the appeal and the stay, he did not get possession until 2008\n",

      "42  According to the facts found by Mr. Justice Pitfield in the fraud action, Ms. Dhillon had first purchased another home on East 50th Avenue using just over $100,000 of the proceeds of sale of the 57th Avenue property, and taking out a mortgage. In 1997, Ms. Dhillon sold that property and purchased the 52nd Avenue property. She also had about $100,000 equity in this home when she purchased it in 1997, but a larger mortgage. In other words, she invested somewhat over half of the proceeds of sale in 1993 into what I conclude would probably have been the same type of real estate Mr. Dhillon would have invested in had he had access to the proceeds of sale in 1993\n",

      "43  In Folland v. Reardon  (C.A.), Mr. Justice Doherty, in quite a different context, in discussing causation, reviewed the law of lost opportunity at para. 71 to 93. He referred to what he described as the seminal case of Kitchen v. Royal Air Forces Association, [1958] 2 All E.R. 241, a case also involving solicitor's negligence. In Kitchen, at p. 251, Lord Evershed, M.R., stated:\n",
      "In my judgment, assuming that the plaintiff has established negligence, what the court has to do in such a case as the present is to determine what the plaintiff has lost by that negligence. The question is: Has the plaintiff lost some right of value, some chose in action of reality and substance? In such a case it may be that its value is not easy to determine, but it is the duty of the court to determine that value as best as it can\n",

      "[81] The loss of chance analysis has been applied in England in a wide variety of solicitors negligence cases, where the answer to the hypothetical question - what would have happened had the solicitor not been negligent? - depends on the actions of a third party. On these authorities, if the plaintiff can establish a real chance that the third party would have acted in a manner that would have avoided the loss suffered by the plaintiff or bestowed a benefit on the plaintiff, the plaintiff has established the solicitor's liability. The degree of the chance lost is a matter for the quantification of the plaintiff's damages: Allied Maples Group v. Simmons & Simmons, [1995] 1 W.L.R. 1602, [1995] 4 All E.R. 907 (C.A.); Jackson and Powell on Professional Negligence, 5th ed. (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 2002), at pp. 680-83\n",

      "49  I accept that, had Mr. Dhillon known in 1993 about the existence of the proceeds of sale of the 57th Avenue property and had he received them, if he had been able to, he would likely have invested all or a significant portion of them in purchasing a residence in Vancouver. I say \"if he had been able to\" because the opportunity he would then have had to invest would have been subject to a number of contingencies\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "50  Those contingencies included, in my view, whether Ms. Dhillon would have made a successful claim against the proceeds of sale in an FRA action, whether Mr. Dhillon would have been able to find a home he could afford to purchase with whatever share he got of the proceeds of sale, whether he qualified for and had the income to service a mortgage, the extent to which the housing market rose while an FRA claim against the sale proceeds was being litigated or negotiated, and whether the real estate market rose or fell (as it happens, it rose). Then, too, there may have been the costs of legal counsel to deal with those matters which may have diminished the funds ultimately available to him and, as well, whether he would have made a more or less advantageous investment than Ms. Dhillon did in purchasing the 52nd Avenue property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "51  Earlier in these reasons I found the defence raised by Mr. Jaffer that Ms. Dhillon had an interest in the sale proceeds under the FRA to be a jus tertii. However, in the context of assessing the possibility of Mr. Dhillon having lost an opportunity to benefit from his not sooner knowing of and receiving the benefit of the sale proceeds, I consider it proper to consider the potential effect of such a claim by Ms. Dhillon as a contingency. In my view, it would be ignoring reality not to. In fact, Ms. Dhillon did commence such a claim but, ultimately, did not proceed with it\n",

      "52  In the result, I consider that Mr. Dhillon did indeed lose an opportunity to invest in the Vancouver real estate market before 2005 as a consequence of not having been made aware sooner of the availability to him of the proceeds of sale in September 1993. But I discount the availability to him of a fund to invest by 50%, given the contingencies noted above. That is, it is my judgment that the funds he would have had to invest would likely have been smaller than $187,200 given the very significant potential of Ms. Dhillon being successful in an FRA claim, a claim that likely would have taken some time to resolve while, in the meantime, the prices of real estate would have risen. Mr. Dhillon presented himself as a man who was not wealthy. This is borne out by the manner in which he lived, including the type of housing in which he and his children resided during the fraud action and up to 2008 when he got possession of the 52nd Avenue property.

Not without much legal grief, Mr. Dhillon obtained possession of the 52nd Avenue property in 2008. But I find that Mr. Dhillon did lose the opportunity to himself invest about $93,600 in the real estate market in Vancouver by 1995, when it is likely any FRA proceeding would have been completed. But any home he would then have been able to purchase would not have been much different in value than those purchased in the same timeframe by Ms. Dhillon, the latter one being now vested in his name.

      "\n",
      "57  In my view, on a common sense view of causation, the fact that Mr. Jaffer, although completely unaware of Ms. Dhillon's fraud and the forged power of attorney, was nonetheless in breach of his duty to Mr. Dhillon not to deal with trust funds he received on Mr. Dhillon's behalf without his instructions, is not reason enough to impose liability on Mr. Jaffer for the separate fraud perpetuated by Ms. Dhillon. The argument that Ms. Dhillon may not have fraudulently withdrawn Mr. Dhillon's VanCity funds had Mr. Jaffer advised Mr. Dhillon of the existence of the sale proceeds sooner, is entirely speculative. The principles of equity are not engaged here as they would be in the case of a breach of fiduciary duty. However, in my view, whether one employs equitable or legal principles, Mr. Jaffer's negligence respecting the trust funds is in no way connected to Ms. Dhillon's fraudulent taking of Mr. Dhillon's VanCity funds\n",

      "58  Respecting the law in this area, I am informed by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Canson Enterprises Ltd. v. Boughton & Co., .\n",
      "4. General Damage\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "59  Since his return to Canada from India in 2000 and upon discovering the fraud that resulted in the sale of his home and the delivery of the sale proceeds by Mr. Jaffer to Ms. Dhillon, Mr. Dhillon appears to have been almost continuously engaged in litigation to put right the wrongs done to him. That is in part because of the litigation road he chose: pursuing Ms. Dhillon and Manohar Dhillon first, then the present action against Mr. Jaffer. Mr. Jaffer might well say that, if he had been sued first, Mr. Dhillon's route to recovery from him may not have been as long and torturous. But the litigation path Mr. Dhillon chose was neither illogical nor inappropriate. Ms. Dhillon had a tangible asset, the 52nd Avenue property and in many ways it made sense to go after Ms. Dhillon and Manohar Dhillon first\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "60  Had Mr. Dhillon had access to all or part of the proceeds of sale in 1993 or 1995, arguably his life would not have been so concerned with litigation and all the stress that entails. He would at least have had more money at his disposal for either payment toward a new home which would have much sooner provided him and his children with stable accommodation, or at least the resources to live in better circumstances. Undoubtedly Mr. Dhillon suffered anxiety and uncertainty in his life for many years (until at least 2005 when he was awarded title to the 52nd Avenue property or, more probably, near the end of 2006 when the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal taken from the trial judgment in the fraud action). Some of this anxiety and uncertainly Mr. Dhillon may have faced in any event had the proceeds of sale been tied up for a time in an FRA action by Ms. Dhillon. That contingency must be considered. But it is highly improbable that FRA litigation would have been anywhere near as protracted and stressful as that which Mr. Dhillon has experienced overall\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "61  As a result of not having his home or all or part of the proceeds of sale from it, Mr. Dhillon was unable to bring his four children from India for a considerable period of time. That made him lonely. At one point he wanted to die\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "62  Of course it was the fraud of Ms. Dhillon and Manohar Dhillon in selling the 57th Avenue property in the first place and not only the negligence of Mr. Jaffer that put Mr. Dhillon into this unhappy state. But Mr. Jaffer's negligence undoubtedly contributed substantially to the agony Mr. Dhillon endured for many years\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "63  The defence points out, properly, that Mr. Dhillon has called no medical evidence to support his claim of emotional distress. However, on a common sense approach, I accept that Mr. Dhillon was probably emotionally distressed by all of these events\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  All of that said, is an award of damages for the misery Mr. Dhillon endured too remote, or is it even a remedy available to Mr. Dhillon in the context of a solicitor's negligence claim in British Columbia\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "65  With respect to the first issue, remoteness, I am satisfied that it was reasonably foreseeable by Mr. Jaffer that paying the proceeds of sale of Mr. Dhillon's home to someone other than him would surely cause Mr. Dhillon significant problems. But, as Mr. Jaffer did not know he was dealing with fraudsters, Mr. Jaffer would have had no way of knowing that Mr. Dhillon's future would include protracted litigation against them. That said, the effect of Mr. Jaffer's negligence on the consequences to Mr. Dhillon is not too remote and is actionable, subject to applicable contingencies\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "66  As for the availability of such a remedy in British Columbia, Mr. Jaffer relies on V.C.P. Homes Inc. v. Fast, , a decision of Mr. Justice Ralph, in which he did not apply Paton v. Shaw  (P.E.I.S.C. (T.D.) (\"Paton\"), a case relied on by Mr. Dhillon. V.C.P. was a surveyor's negligence case, Paton a solicitor's negligence case. In Paton, the court awarded $15,000 a year for the \"mental anxiety, the uncertainty and the personal difficulties\" the claimant suffered by reason of an adverse tax assessment given as the result of his solicitor's negligent tax advice\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "67  However in V.C.P., Mr. Justice Ralph declined to make an award of general damages to the individual plaintiff, Mr. Seel, for having to sell his family home, borrow money, and suffer discomfort and disruption in his personal life. He noted at para. 78 that \"... for most individuals, being party to litigation is a distressing and disrupting experience\". In the result, Mr. Justice Ralph did not find, on the facts of the case before him, sufficient evidence that the conduct of the defendant or its impact upon Mr. Seel supported an order of general damages and he declined to make one\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  This is quite a different result from the way it was framed by counsel for Mr. Jaffer in argument before me, namely that case law from British Columbia does not support the proposition that a successful negligence action against a solicitor attracts an award of general damages. V.C.P. is simply a case where the trial judge found that the evidence did not support such an award\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "69  The defence also cites my decision in Petersen v. Power, . In that case, on the authority of Vorvis v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia  (S.C.C.), I determined that in a case of contract, a claim for damages for mental distress must flow from an independent actionable wrong\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "70  In Petersen, the plaintiff had sued a surveyor in negligence and other parties in breach of contract. I dismissed both claims. But, in the alternative, I assessed damages. A close reading of para. 53 to 58 of Petersen makes clear that I did not decide the issue of the claims for emotional and mental distress other than in the context of a claim in contract\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  It is my view that a claim for damages for mental distress consequent upon the negligence of a solicitor is not foreclosed in British Columbia. But must that be negligence in the context of where there also exists a fiduciary duty, such as when a solicitor is negligent in his duty to his own client? I think not, as long as the negligence resulted in injury that is reasonably foreseeable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "72  In this case, I conclude that the greater portion of Mr. Dhillon's distress was brought on by the actions of the fraudster rather than by Mr. Jaffer. However Mr. Jaffer's negligence did contribute to it in a measurable and significant way. By \"measurable\", I mean to the extent of one-third of overall general damages that I assess at $120,000, or $40,000.\n",
      "5. Mitigatio\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "73  In his statement of defence, Mr. Jaffer pleads:\n",
      "In the further alternative, Jaffer says that if Gurmej has suffered damages as alleged, which is not admitted but which is specifically denied, then he has failed to mitigate his damages and, in the further alternative, the damages claimed are too remote in law\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "74  However, in argument, Mr. Jaffer advanced the proposition that Mr. Dhillon has been so successful in mitigating his damages (in the fraud action) that he has consequently avoided the loss occasioned by Mr. Jaffer's negligence. In my view, in the face of his pleading, Mr. Jaffer is not entitled to advance this argument which is entirely contrary to his pleading\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "75  In the event I am in error in this conclusion, I would state that I am far from satisfied that the fraud action resulted in a full, or even partial, mitigation by Mr. Dhillon of his having been deprived of the proceeds of the sale of the 57th Avenue property. While he did not get possession of the 52nd Avenue property until 2008, he was awarded title to it (subject to encumbrances that brought him more grief) on July 15, 2005. It is as of that date that one must value the benefit of the fraud litigation result to Mr. Dhillon and the extent to which it affects any liability to him by Mr. Jaffer. In 2005, this property was assessed at $492,000. It was subject to a mortgage to RBC. The amount then owing is not in evidence, but it would have been between $290,000 (the original amount in 1997) and $221,500 (the balance in June 2008). When Mr. Dhillon did get possession, he also had to deal with RBC's foreclosure action and come up with $44,600 to bring the mortgage into good standing\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "76  Had Mr. Dhillon been able to invest all of the sale proceeds in 1993, or half of them in 1995, he would surely have enjoyed a measure of equity growth. While there is a paucity of evidence respecting his legal costs in the fraud action, Mr. Dhillon's uncontradicted testimony is that he spent at least $100,000. So, all in all, it is far from certain that the result to Mr. Dhillon of the fraud action (including the money part of the judgment which has apparently proven to be almost entirely a dry judgment) has resulted in any mitigation. I am not satisfied that, had I been prepared to find that Mr. Jaffer could rely on his argument respecting mitigation, that argument has been made out.\n",
      "6. Court Order Interes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "77  Mr. Dhillon is entitled to court order interest at Registrar's rates on the amount of the sale proceeds from September 30, 1993 to date of this judgment. I find that the date of judgment is the appropriate date to which to calculate interest, rather than July 2005 or March 2008, given my view on mitigation and the reality that Mr. Dhillon has had no access to this money.\n",

      "1  In an assessment issued in 1999 and confirmed by the Minister of National Revenue after an internal appeal in 2000 respecting income tax for 1993, 1994, and 1995, Mr. Leroux was advised he owed over $600,000 in taxes, interest and penalties. In a consent judgment in the Tax Court of Canada, issued June 16, 2005, respecting those years, adjustments were made to the tax debt, by then over $800,000 as a result of daily compounded interest, resulting in a settlement of about $57,000. After some payments and a \"fairness application\" to the Minister of National Revenue, resulting in the cancellation of all interest and penalties, Mr. Leroux was owed an income tax refund of about $25,000, which was offset against outstanding GST, for a net result of zero. In the meantime, Mr. Leroux had lost his business - an RV park which was also his home - and most of his property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "2  Mr. Leroux alleges he lost everything, in particular his home and business, because of the actions of employees of the tax department and he sues the Canada Revenue Agency (\"CRA\") for negligence. In addition to losing his assets, which were foreclosed on and sold at a loss, he says his health has suffered, and he has incurred high legal and accounting expenses\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "3  Mr. Leroux also alleges that a CRA auditor, Mr. Hansen, had actually done his GST returns for him, but audited those same returns nevertheless. As well, he says Mr. Hansen threatened very high income tax assessments through an audit proposal, and promised to \"make the whole thing go away\" if Mr. Leroux paid him $25,000. Mr. Leroux says that when he would not agree to not make the payment, the huge income tax assessments were levied\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "4  Mr. Leroux also claims Mr. Hansen lost or shredded two boxes of his documents relating to both GST and income tax, but continued to demand that Mr. Leroux supply original documents. Mr. Leroux alleges that CRA employees told him Mr. Hansen, who died in December of 1998, the same month that he allegedly demanded the payment, either overdosed on drugs or shot himself\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "5  Based on Mr. Hansen's alleged actions, Mr. Leroux sues for misfeasance in public office\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "7  Even if a duty of care is owed, the CRA says its officers acted reasonably throughout and the deficiencies in the audits and assessments were due to Mr. Leroux's failure to supply supporting documents and books and records, omissions he finally rectified during the negotiations in Tax Court, resulting in the settlement. CRA submits that although the positions taken by the auditors regarding the tax treatment of Mr. Leroux's declared income did not eventually prevail in the Tax Court settlement, they were not arrived at negligently. As well, Mr. Leroux's financial position was so poor that the loss of his business would have occurred in any event. In addition, Mr. Leroux could have prevented the filing of a judgment in respect of income tax against his property by filing an appeal, but did not do so for almost two years after the final assessment\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "8  CRA produced autopsy reports to show that Mr. Hansen, only 38 years old, died of a heart attack as a result of coronary heart disease, not a drug overdose or a suicide. When Mr. Hansen died, the assessment for GST was already complete and a proposal letter, approved by Mr. Hansens' supervisor, Mr. Mlynarczyk, had already been sent respecting income tax. Therefore it would have been impossible for Mr. Hansen to \"make the whole thing go away.\" CRA characterizes the allegation that Mr. Hansen purported to extort a bribe from Mr. Leroux as scandalous\n",

      "12  It has been challenging to find an organizing principle for the evidence, given the number of years covered, the numerous issues, both factual and legal, and the difference between Mr. Leroux's recollections and perceptions and those of the defendant's witnesses. I have therefore set out the evidence sequentially and some overlapping has been inevitable.\n",

      "13  Mr. Leroux is 69 years old. He has a grade 7 education and obtained trade certificates in heavy duty mechanics and sheet metal working. In the late 1980's, he was involved in an accident that interfered with his ability to continue his sheet metal work, so he accepted a job overseeing some logging which was being done on an estate in Valemount, B.C. The beneficiaries did not want to keep the property and Mr. Leroux saw its potential\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "14  Mr. Leroux purchased part of the property from the beneficiaries in 1989, and the remainder in 1993. He planned to subdivide part of the property into 11 lots and sell those lots to pay off a mortgage he intended to take out to build an RV park on another lot, referred to as Lot 12. He also had a vague plan to build a water bottling plant on part of the property and keep the remaining part for personal use\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "15  Mr. Leroux testified that in 1993 he began to clear the logs from Lot 12 and sell them to a local sawmill. The people running the sawmill told him he would need a GST number before they could issue cheques\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  Mr. Leroux testified that he went to the CRA office in Prince George, B.C., and spoke with Mr. Hansen, who told him GST was new for them as well as it had only recently replaced the old excise tax. Mr. Leroux said he told Mr. Hansen he needed the number for timber from his land clearing as he was taking the logs to a sawmill. Mr. Hansen told Mr. Leroux he would have to create a company name. Mr. Leroux chose \"Leroux Holdings\", a proprietorship. Mr. Hansen asked Mr. Leroux if he wanted to declare his GST monthly, quarterly, or annually. Mr. Leroux chose quarterly and Mr. Hansen told him he would assist him with his forms\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  Mr. Leroux said thereafter he would get a slip in the mail telling him to pay within 30 days. He would bring in his cheque stubs to Mr. Hansen and they would fill out the forms together. At first Mr. Hansen did it all; then Mr. Leroux would fill in the forms using Mr. Hansen's calculations. Mr. Leroux testified initially that he thought he had filed returns through 1993, but then said he recalled that the first return was filed in 1994\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  Mr. Leroux used Deloitte and Touche (\"Deloitte\") as his accountants for his income tax returns in 1993. He took his documents to them and told the accountant the expenses were from clearing his site for his RV park. His income tax returns were filed, claiming the income from the logs as a capital gain\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  In 1994, Mr. Leroux started clearing logs from the part of the property on which he planned to build the subdivision as he wanted to sell some lots to pay down his mortgage. By this time, he had decided to transfer his accounting business to the Charles Givens Organization. This group was promoting time shares and offered accounting services to time share owners. Mr. Leroux testified that he provided them with copies of all of his documents, which they lost\n",

      "\n",
      "20  By 1995, Mr. Leroux had cleared all the land. He obtained approval to subdivide the lots in October of 1995. He began to deal with various government departments to get approvals and zoning for his RV park\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "21  From Mr. Leroux's point of view, his problems began in October of 1996 when Mr. Hansen advised him that he was to be the subject of a random audit for GST for the tax years 1993, 1994, and 1995. Mr. Leroux said Mr. Hansen set up a meeting on October 15, 1996 at Mr. Leroux's residence\n",

      "22  On October 7, 1996, another auditor, Ms. Quance, sent Mr. Leroux a letter referring him to a previous telephone conversation, advising him the audit concerned his income tax for 1993, 1994, and 1995, and setting up a meeting on October 15, 1996. Mr. Leroux testified he did not notice the reference to income tax at the time. He acknowledged in cross examination that he had sworn an affidavit deposing that Ms. Quance had phoned him to tell him he would be audited for both income tax and GST\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  Mr. Leroux said he had asked the auditors to go through his documents at Deloitte's offices, but they threatened to call the RCMP when they arrived, so he let them into the house. He put out two boxes of documents for them, had a short discussion, and left for Valemount, leaving the two auditors in the house, telling them to lock up when they left\n",

      "26  Mr. Leroux said he went to see Mr. Hansen and angrily demanded the return of his personal items. Mr. Hansen told him they were mixed in with the business documents and he would call him when he could pick them up. Mr. Leroux waited for the call which came some time later. When he went to the office, Mr. Hansen told him all his documents had been shredded, he thought by the cleaners, and it was Mr. Leroux's responsibility to replace the documents\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  Mr. Leroux continued to deal with Mr. Hansen over the next two years, as Mr. Hansen kept requesting records. I will deal with the evidence from the defendant in more detail later, but it is clear that a proposal letter in respect of the adjustments to both GST and income tax was sent by Mr. Hansen to Mr. Leroux on September 25, 1997 to the Quince Street address\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  The proposal letter set out the position CRA intended to take and asked for a response. In addition to requiring supporting documentation for expenses, CRA did not accept that income from logs cleared in 1993 was capital gains, nor would they allow logging expenses respecting the subdivision lands in 1994 and 1995 to be deducted from income until lots were sold (a concept referred to as \"matching\")\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  Meanwhile, through 1996 and 1997, Mr. Leroux dealt with the municipality of Valemount and attended town meetings related to the RV park. He did a traffic impact and feasibility study. He needed money for the infrastructure. He used his own money and some additional funds that he borrowed from friends\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  Mr. Leroux sought the assistance of a bank loan. He took his plans and studies to all the banks in Prince George but only the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) would lend him money. In February of 1998, BDC gave him a mortgage for $400,000 and a loan of $150,000, both secured against the land in Valemount. Mr. Leroux continued his developments on the RV park and the subdivision\n",
      "======\n",

      "32  On October 16, 1998, as a result of the audit, Mr. Leroux received a reassessment from CRA in the amount of $82,193 in respect of GST for 1993, 1994, and 1995. Mr. Leroux's initial filing position on GST had been that he was owed about $18,000 as a refund\n",

      "33  According to Mr. Leroux, Mr. Hansen called him sometime in December 1998, asking him to come in to the office. At this time, Mr. Leroux was very busy on many fronts with the RV park construction. He met with Mr. Hansen who commented that CRA was coming after him for a lot of money. Mr. Leroux said he did not accept the figures. Mr. Hansen told Mr. Leroux to give him $25,000 and he would make his CRA problems disappear. Mr. Leroux said Mr. Hansen was behaving strangely, letting his eyes roll back in his head for 20 to 30 seconds at a time, and seeming to go into a kind of trance\n",

He said BDC refused to accept any more payments so he made none after October of 2000. Mr. Leroux says he understood this was because CRA had registered a judgment against his land and because he had not paid his property taxes which he was allowed to defer for three years.

Another lot was sold to pay Mr. Leroux's legal bill with Thorsteinssons, who had acted for him on the appeals to Tax Court. Mr. Leroux was left with the other two parts of the property.

Mr. Harris met with different Ministers of National Revenue at various times regarding Mr. Leroux's tax difficulties. Mr. Harris testified that he understood CRA had caused Mr. Leroux a lot of damage by assessing taxes he did not owe, trying to seize his property, and causing the bank to call his loan.

Mr. Harris said Mr. Leroux had no money for a lawyer, and he was told that Mr. Leroux should start a lawsuit and CRA would not fight it very hard.

Mr. Leroux denied any knowledge of their position and blamed the statements on the law firm. When questioned about Deloitte's failure to file an appeal on time, thus paving the way for registration of the large income tax judgment, Mr. Leroux denied any knowledge of it. He refused to blame Deloitte, saying it was all CRA's fault. When questioned about the documents lost by the Charles Givens Organization in respect of his 1994 and 1995 taxation years, he insisted those documents had nothing to do with the processes being undertaken by Hansen and Quance, even though those years were the subject of their audit. When questioned about Mr. Hansen's death, Mr. Leroux could not say who told him Mr. Hansen died of a drug overdose or had shot himself, and was evasive when asked why he would rely on such a story\n",

When asked why the Laurentian mortgage and the Hong Kong Bank judgment, which ranked ahead of CRA, were not of concern, he said CRA has all the power and could compel a sale.

      "REVENUES. The Department is increasing the revenue amounts in 1993 by the amounts shown on the payment statements received from Slocan Forest Products. These amounts had originally been reported as a capital gain. The capital gain has been deducted from the tax return. The Department has also increased the revenues in 1994 and the revenue amount in 1995 based on the payment statements from Slocan Forest Products and discrepancies found between deposits to the taxpayer's bank account and revenue amounts from all sources. At this point the department is assuming the discrepancies are due to unreported revenue.\n",
      "COST OF GOOD SOLD. The Department is disallowing all amounts claimed as Cost of Goods Sold as the taxpayer has not sold any of the lots at this time. Cost of Goods Sold can be recalculated and expensed when there are sales of the lots.\n",
      "TAXABLE CAPITAL GAIN. The Department has reversed this amount as your activity of logging the land in order to clear it for the purpose of building a subdivision is not capital in nature. All amounts received for the sale of the logs have been brought into income. All supported eligible expenses for the year have been allowed\n",

      "95  The result of the proposed changes by CRA was that the logs cleared in 1993 would be treated as business income, rather than a capital asset resulting from the preparations to operate the RV park, because CRA did not understand that those logs had been taken from the lot on which the RV park was to be built. The logs cleared in 1994 and 1995 from the subdivision lots would be business income with no offset of the expense of clearing them allowable until the lots were sold. As well, there were substantial expenses claimed in 1994 and 1995 that were not documented\n",

This assessment was issued within the four year statutory limitation provided for in the Excise Tax Act.

Mr. Needham sent Mr. Leroux a letter on August 6, 1999 to his Quince Street address (which was already subject to foreclosure) telling him what their position would be on his reassessment and referred him to the proposal letter of September 25, 1997, sent two years before. He prepared a penalty report in August. Mr. Needham's notes of September 14, 1999 indicate that the ledgers for 1992 to 1997 were returned to Mr. Leroux's son, with a signed receipt\n",

Mr. Needham acknowledged in cross examination that there were several indicators that the logging in 1993 could be capital gains - for instance it appeared that Mr. Leroux had no history of buying and developing land and intended to use part of the land for an RV park that he would operate - but Mr. Needham relied on Ms. Quance's notes. He did not check to see whether Mr. Leroux was actually operating a trailer park. Thus the characterization of all the 1993 income changed from being sheltered to being taxable. There was no issue of non-reporting in respect of the logging; Mr. Needham agreed that Mr. Leroux reported all the logging proceeds\n",

The bank was particularly concerned about the arrears of property taxes because it could lose its charge in a tax sale. Six weeks before the demand letter, on October 2, 2000, the bank sent a letter to Mr. Leroux agreeing to put their remedies on hold if Mr. Leroux paid $2,800 per month into a tax reserve account, with the bank authorized to pay the taxes.

Mr. Calderon said he knew of the GST judgment, which was already filed, and that was an event of default. He said, however, that the bank would not foreclose because of that judgment if the mortgage were current. He did not know of the income tax claim until the judgment was filed in July of 2001\n",

The bank filed its petition in September of 2001. Mr. Calderon said the reason for the foreclosure was the default of payments under the mortgage and the property tax arrears for 1998, 1999, and 2000, and nothing else. Mr. Calderon said the CRA judgment was not of concern to them because they had priority. CRA did not imperil their security\n",

Mr. Calderon said Mr. Leroux accused him of telling buyers to wait for the foreclosure to get a better price, something Mr. Leroux had denied.

The bank listed the property at $1.5 million, and after two to three months, the listing went down to $1.1 million. They received offers in the summer and fall of 2002 of $500,000 and $600,000, and eventually accepted one in February of 2003 for $825,900, with the additional $50,000 for goodwill that came in subsequently from Mr. Leroux to the receiver.\n",

There was, of course, the issue of failure to produce documentation to support Mr. Leroux's expenses, but the main differences between the tax treatment in the returns as filed and the assessment issued by Mr. Needham in September of 1999 were the capital gains/income treatment of the logs cleared in 1993, and the failure to allow expenses to be set off against income from log clearing on the subdivision lots in 1994 and 1995. Mr. Hansen's proposal letter of September 1997 and Mr. Needham's letter of August 1999 had contained explanations for the reassessments but it is not clear what happened to those letters from Mr. Leroux's point of view\n",

Mr. Cheung said he would not look at general issues; he looks only at what is raised on the Notice of Objection, and there was no point looking at the income tax objection until the books and records were produced in the GST process. Mr. Cheung said many times in his evidence that the only issue was production of the books and records promised in the GST Notice of Objection, despite the different wording of the Notice of Objection filed a year later in respect of income tax. As Mr. Leroux never produced books and records, Mr. Cheung did not consider either objection further. He did not consider the issue of penalties and whether they were justified because the issue was not raised in the Notice of Objection\n",

      "125  Mr. Cheung said Mr. Hansen was wrong to threaten to assess gross negligence penalties in order to open up statute barred years. However, Mr. Cheung was of the view that one misrepresentation opens up the whole year for penalties, although penalties can be assessed on the increase only, not the whole amount. He did not look at this issue, even in 1995 where the penalties were over 900%, because it was not contained in the Notice of Objection\n",

(B.C.S.C.), a case in which CRA officials were held to have deliberately misled the taxpayer, resulting in a finding of misfeasance in public office. The court noted at para. 137 that CRA has an \"obligation to deal fairly and openly with all taxpayers and to administer the Act in accordance with the law\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "209  Mr. Leroux also referred to Chhabra v. Canada  (F.C.T.D.), where CRA officials were found, according to the headnote, to be unrelenting, unreasonable, overzealous, and malicious in pursuing a debt based on a dubious assessment. The taxpayer was unrepresented and had not set out any clear cause of action. The court considered a number of bases of potential liability, and, finding both \"malice and a clear indication that the officials knew that they did not possess the power which they purported to exercise\", concluded there was misfeasance in public office. The court ordered $1,000 general damages and $10,000 exemplary damages\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "210  There is no suggestion in argument or evidence that any of the employees of CRA knew Mr. Leroux or had a personal animus towards him, or that their actions were motivated by malice\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "211  The plaintiff's position, put forward in argument, is that Mr. Hansen met Mr. Leroux, judged his level of sophistication, entered his house and audited his return, took personal papers and items of sentimental value while Mr. Leroux was out of the house, lost all the backup documents, insisted on the production of originals knowing they were gone, demanded a bribe from Mr. Leroux, and raised a grossly wrong appraisal when he refused to comply\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "212  Thus there are a number of allegations of overtly unfair and/or illegal conduct and I will go through each of them\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "213  First, I accept Ms. Quance's evidence that she and Mr. Hansen were invited in by Mr. Leroux and did not enter the house with the threat of help from the RCMP. Ms. Quance acknowledged that they did not advise Mr. Leroux that he did not have to let them into the house, but she had sent a letter to him on October 7, 1996 confirming their telephone conversation and saying they would be meeting him at his Quince Street address. I also accept that Mr. Leroux remained with the auditors in the house and they were not left alone and told to lock up when they left. The document Ms. Quance signed stating she had received two boxes of documents is also signed by Mr. Leroux, which would not occur if he had already gone to Valemount. Mr. Leroux's evidence that he would leave the auditors alone in the house after they had forced their way in by threatening to use the RCMP is not credible\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "214  Thus I do not accept Mr. Leroux's evidence that the auditors were left alone in the house and went through his personal filing cabinets, taking items of sentimental value and inserting personal receipts into his business envelopes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "215  Mr. Leroux says Mr. Hansen told him the two boxes of documents were lost or shredded while at the CRA offices, and that it was his responsibility to replace them. CRA has not been able to produce a copy of the receipt on which return of the documents would be acknowledged\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "216  Ms. Quance and Mr. Mylnarczyk testified to the care which is taken to ensure that taxpayers' documents are safeguarded. The office had a \"clean desk\" policy - everything had to be locked in their record storage room or in a filing cabinet every night. Mr. Mylnarczyk conducted surprise security checks after everyone had gone home\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "217  Ms. Quance said Mr. Leroux had bundles of invoices and receipts stapled together with till tapes. CRA went through those documents carefully and all those worksheets and calculations were later available for Mr. Needham. Mr. Hansen's notes make no mention of lost documents but they do mention other documents Mr. Leroux brought in at later meetings - a columnar book and a notebook, along with some receipts and bank statements and promises to obtain more. Mr. Hansen's entry for July 31, 1997 says \"I gave all backup documentation back to Mr. Leroux with the exception of a few purchase receipts for 1993\". This is reflected in Mr. Leroux's statement in his \"fairness\" application in 2006 in which he says he got his documents back in 1997, although he maintained a lot of them were missing\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "218  Mr. Leroux's Notice of Objection to the GST assessment makes reference to now having all his documents, which he stated were previously incomplete and in disarray. He does not say CRA lost or destroyed his documents, which would have been a natural point to mention. The assertion that all his documents were lost or destroyed by CRA was not mentioned by Mr. Leroux for many years. The issue is also clouded by Mr. Leroux's testimony that the Charles Givens Organization, who did his taxes in 1994 and 1995, lost at least two years of documents as well, although he says those were copies, not originals\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "219  Although Mr. Leroux stated in his Notice of Objection to the GST assessment that he had all his documents in proper order, he never produced any further documents to CRA, according to Mr. Needham. It was not until Thorsteinssons became involved and were able to obtain information from the subcontractors that CRA was able to follow up and apply additional input tax credits to Mr. Leroux's GST account\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "220  Taking all of the evidence into account, it appears Mr. Leroux was quite casual about documentation, whereas CRA was painstaking in their detailed and relentless approach. I am not persuaded that CRA lost or shredded Mr. Leroux's documents\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "221  In any event, no causation has been established. Mr. Leroux, even on his own evidence, is unable to draw a connection between the allegedly lost documents and the foreclosure and loss of his property. At most, the alleged loss of his documents caused him distress, inconvenience, and wasted time; it did not cause him to lose his property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "222  The next complaint is that Mr. Hansen prepared Mr. Leroux's GST returns and then audited those same returns\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "223  Ms. Quance said an auditor would never help a taxpayer with returns, but Ms. Coffey, an employee of CRA with whom Mr. Leroux left his Notice of Objection to the GST assessment in December of 1998 when Mr. Hansen was not available, said people called in regularly with questions about the GST and she would always help them. Mr. Mlynarczyk, Mr. Hansen's Team Leader, said the auditors were encouraged to assist but would not actually fill out forms\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "224  Mr. Leroux said he gave Mr. Hansen the figures and at first Mr. Hansen did the calculations and filled in the forms. Then Mr. Leroux filled in the forms with Mr. Hansen's help. Mr. Leroux initially said this went on through 1993 and 1994; then he said it started in 1994, and he filled in some returns and Mr. Hansen filled in some. In 1995, the logging was finished and Mr. Leroux filed his own \"nil\" returns. None of the original returns were available, so handwriting could not be examined\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "225  Mr. Leroux's evidence was quite vague on the issue of the GST returns and how and when they were filled out and by whom. Obviously, even if Mr. Hansen did help Mr. Leroux fill out some of the returns, he would have used the information Mr. Leroux provided to him. The audit of the GST was based on the need to produce documentation from contractors to support input tax credits. This information had to come from Mr. Leroux and was not produced until the proceedings in Tax Court. Thus there is no particular significance to the assistance, if any, provided by Mr. Hansen and the later audit of the returns, nor is there any causative link between Mr. Hansen's assistance, his role in the GST audit, and the loss of Mr. Leroux's property\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "226  I will turn now to the allegation that Mr. Hansen tried to extort money from Mr. Leroux in December of 1998\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "227  Mr. Leroux called three witnesses to attest to his account of this event soon after it happened, to rebut an allegation of recent complaint. The witnesses were Richard Harris, MP, Mr. Reid, a friend, and Mr. Turmel, Mr. Leroux's son-in-law and a member of the RCMP. All said Mr. Leroux told them of this event in late 1998\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "228  Mr. Hansen died shortly after the alleged extortion attempt and Mr. Leroux was convinced it was an unnatural death arising from drug abuse or suicide. Ms. Quance was involved in the audit along with Mr. Hansen, and all of his actions were overseen by his Team Leader, Mr. Mlynarczyk. Mr. Hansen's co-workers testified to his professionalism and work ethic. As CRA points out, Mr. Leroux's stories about how Mr. Hansen died are completely unfounded\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "229  It appears from Mr. Leroux's testimony and that of his witnesses that he is and was genuinely under the apprehension that Mr. Hansen did ask him for money, although he says he discounted it as the equivalent of a school yard bully trying to take his lunch money and did not consider doing anything about it. This allegation only surfaced in the fairness application, many years after it supposedly happened, but he did apparently tell some version of this to his three witnesses in late 1998\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "230  Looked at in context, Mr. Hansen could not have made any of Mr. Leroux's tax problems go away by accepting money - the GST tax assessment had already been levied and sent to Mr. Leroux, and the proposal letter on the changes to Mr. Leroux's income tax had already been sent to him. Mr. Mlynarczyk testified that he reviewed all proposal letters in detail. Counsel for Mr. Leroux acknowledged that he had tried to make sense of this allegation by coming up with a way in which $25,000 would have some significance in this context but was unable to. The sum of $25,000 has no relevance to any of the amounts in issue\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "231  The subsequent income tax assessment, characterized by Mr. Leroux as grossly inflated, could have had no relation to the alleged bribery attempt because the proposal letter, which was reflected in the assessment, had already been sent in September of that year. Mr. Leroux did not respond to the proposal letter and Mr. Needham followed up with the formal assessment, using both Ms. Quance's and Mr. Hansen's work. The GST reassessment had already been done. Thus, even if I accepted that such a conversation took place, it did not cause any of the subsequent events. Perhaps it was hoped that an inference would be drawn from the allegation that Mr. Hansen died of a drug overdose or that he shot himself to the effect that he was not in his right mind, thus explaining why he would make such a preposterous suggestion. However, Mr. Hansen did not shoot himself. He died of a heart attack brought on by coronary artery disease, not the use of drugs\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "232  Mr. Hansen did have a conversation with Mr. Leroux which is of concern - that is the conversation in which Mr. Hansen asked Mr. Leroux to sign a waiver for the statute barred years or he would assess gross negligence penalties in order to open up those years. I will deal with this further, and it may be that Mr. Leroux misunderstood or misconstrued some of this conversation. However, I am not persuaded that Mr. Hansen offered to accept a bribe to make Mr. Leroux's tax problems go away, and as a consequence of this unsuccessful extortion attempt, ensured that the huge reassessment followed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "233  CRA takes the position that the claim of misfeasance is limitation barred. While acknowledging that a claim can be delayed until the final Tax Court decision, here the behaviour that is alleged to form the basis of the misfeasance has nothing to do with the assessment. Counsel for Mr. Leroux says the claim is not so much a standalone claim as an additional factual basis to shore up the claim in negligence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "234  The limitation defence has merit as well, but insofar as there is a separate claim of misfeasance in public office, it is dismissed because of the findings of fact above. The history of dealings between CRA and Mr. Leroux still remains relevant in the discussion of negligence.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "236  First, Mr. Leroux says the results of the actions of CRA on taxpayers are obviously foreseeable. The relationship is set out by statute and puts the taxpayer at the mercy of CRA, while requiring him to cooperate fully or face penalties. Punitive measures are available to CRA and in this case were used unfairly and improperly, causing Mr. Leroux extensive losses that were obviously foreseeable. Mr. Crowley acknowledged on examination for discovery that failure by CRA to do its job properly could have serious consequences that were foreseeable. CRA's letters to Mr. Leroux advising him of the registration of judgments include a warning about the consequences - an admission of foreseeability\n",

      "\n",
      "238  Next, Mr. Leroux says there is the required degree of proximity between CRA and the taxpayer. It is a close personal relationship. It is confidential. The taxpayer cannot opt out of the relationship. It is an offence to impede an auditor. In this particular case, the evidence clearly demonstrates a focus by CRA on Mr. Leroux, creating a close personal relationship between him and the auditors\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "239  Mr. Leroux submits that the very extent of the changes in the assessment and the huge penalties that followed upon a characterization of gross negligence in circumstances that were not justified had to alert the auditors to the importance of taking reasonable care. While most of the actions of CRA were generally within the letter of the law, they were often reprehensible and not in accord with the standards of honesty and openness acknowledged to exist by Mr. Crowley on discovery\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "240  Mr. Leroux contends that the required standard of care is compliance with the Income Tax Act, the training provided to CRA's employees, the case law, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, and representations made to the public. To assert a duty to take reasonable care and act fairly when dealing with taxpayers should not be chilling; public officials should welcome such a standard. Integrity, respect, professionalism, consistency, adherence to standards, and cooperation should be the values and guiding principles by which the standard of care is measured\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "241  Mr. Leroux submits that policy arguments based on floodgates should not override this duty to be accountable to the public. CRA guarantees accountability but in reality has managed to create a middle ground where they are exempt from legal action. No matter how egregious their conduct, short of the standard required for misfeasance in public office, all the Tax Court can do is determine the correctness of the assessment. In the case law to date, negligent conduct by employees at CRA cannot be raised\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "242  Mr. Leroux says the conduct of CRA cannot be protected simply because there is an appeal to Tax Court. If that position continues to be accepted, wrongs cannot be addressed, and entire net worths and livelihoods are often at stake and may be destroyed. There must be a forum to hold CRA accountable and that can only be this court, through the common law principles of negligence. If CRA is concerned about further actions, they can demand releases with their Tax Court settlements\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "243  While courts have refused to impose a duty of care on CRA in other cases, Mr. Leroux says his case demonstrates the need to make CRA accountable. Without a forum in which to do so, the employees of CRA are unchecked and are never called on for their behaviour\n",

      "\n",
      "244  Mr. Leroux draws an analogy between a taxpayer targeted by CRA auditors and a suspect under police investigation, as in Hill v. Hamilton Wentworth Regional Police Services Board,  .

The legislative scheme shows that duties owed by CRA are owed to the Minister of National Revenue and the public at large. The interests of CRA and taxpayers are inherently opposed. The self-reporting self-assessing tax scheme set out in the Income Tax Act depends on the honesty of taxpayers who must make detailed and complete disclosure\n",

Canada Customs, ; Alberta Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General), ; Leighton v. Canada (Attorney General), ; Foote v. Canada (Attorney General), ). Nor are there analogous cases from which a duty might be constructed. Relationships involving doctors, lawyers, and accountants already fall within exiting categories and are not analogous. The analogy attempted to be drawn by the plaintiff with the Hill relationship is faulty because the rights involved in that case arose under the Charter. The damage alleged here is only economic\n",

      "252  Mr. Leroux says the difference between the income tax assessment and the eventual result in Tax Court is so shocking it speaks for itself, but there are many breaches of the standard of care made out in the evidence. This all occurs against the background of the tax legislation, in particular the sections relevant to this case, which he contends are incomprehensible. The CRA employees themselves could not understand them when asked about them in the witness box and differed on their interpretations of them\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "253  Mr. Leroux says the following breaches occurred:\n",
      "The auditors did not inform Mr. Leroux that he had the right to refuse them entrance to his home.\n",
      "Mr. Hansen should not have conducted audits on returns which he had assisted Mr. Leroux in filling out.\n",
      "Mr. Hansen lost Mr. Leroux's documents which put Mr. Leroux into a very difficult position.\n",
      "1993 taxation year: Mr. Leroux gave an honest description of his activities and set it out in his T-1. Ms. Quance took an innocent answer about land development and made it into something else entirely, changing capital gains into income, and ruining Mr. Leroux in the process. Ms. Quance acknowledged that capital gains versus income is one of the most difficult characterizations to make.\n",
      "1994 and 1995 taxation years: Ms. Quance blindly applied her understanding of GAAP principles, imposing an inappropriate \"matching\" requirement on Mr. Leroux, and ignoring the case law which states that the valuation systems under the Income Tax Act are specific exceptions to general business principles rooted in financial accounting, designed to achieve a conservative picture of business income (Friesen v. Canada , at para 71; confirmed in Canderel Ltd. v. Canada  at paras 36 and 37, which was decided after Ms. Quance's determinations but before Mr. Needham's final assessment).\n",
      "Mr. Hansen asked Mr. Leroux to sign the waiver or he would assess gross negligence penalties to get around the statute bar, even though the tests are different and must not be conflated.\n",
      "Mr. Needham simply followed along, using the Hansen/Quance working papers, without any independent consideration, even though the penalties he recommended in his penalty report in 1995 were over 900% of the taxes owing. He did not consider what portions of the tax debt justified penalties - he simply applied them generally to the whole debt.\n",
      "The penalties were not warranted; there was not sufficient information to assess gross negligence. The characterization of the income in all three years was acknowledged to be difficult. A difference of opinion on characterization is not gross negligence. The penalties were assessed for an improper purpose - to get around the statute bar.\n",
      "The penalty limits were ignored. The auditors differed amongst themselves as to whether or not losses would be taken into account in the calculations of penalties. The penalties for 1995 were over 900% and no one noticed, even though Mr. Needham's supervisor, Mr. Mylnarczyk, said losses should not factor into the calculation. As well, the auditors ignored the provision of the Act which states that gross negligence penalties can only be applied in respect of the tax that relates to the grossly negligent statement. The auditors took the position \"once you're in, you're in\" and assessed penalties against the entirety of the tax for each year.\n",
      "Mr. Cheung received both appeal files together. The GST appeal had been launched a year before but no action had been taken on it, and the debt continued to compound daily.\n",
      "Mr. Cheung did nothing on the appeals but send both files back to the original auditor and then refuse to incorporate Mr. Needham's adjustments. He was not even aware of the underlying issues that caused the big difference in tax treatment between Mr. Leroux's income tax returns and the reassessments. When Mr. Needham told him nothing was forthcoming, he simply confirmed the assessments.\n",
      "Mr. Leroux contends that if Mr. Cheung had incorporated Mr. Needham's suggested revisions, as he should have done, he would have to have issued a new assessment which would have given Mr. Leroux a further 90 days to appeal. This would have required vacating the judgment already filed because it would be based on a nullity.\n",
      "Although Mr. Holmes acted legally when filing the judgments, his conduct in rejecting Mr. Leroux's offer of security for the GST judgment, demanding the best possible security, and noting his plan to file the IT judgment immediately upon releasing the GST judgment is not honourable.\n",

      "256  CRA says there is no expert evidence on the standard expected of auditors. In order to determine what a reasonably competent tax auditor would do, the Court requires assistance. The plaintiff's analysis is overly simplistic in that he points to the eventual result versus the first assessment and says the facts speak for themselves. However, the assessments involved complex legal issues and were eventually resolved in the plaintiff's favour because of substantial new information provided much later in the process. Mere variation in result does not mean the initial assessments were unreasonable, and breach of a statute does not constitute negligence\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "257  In its submissions, CRA provided a review of many cases to demonstrate how complex the issues are of capital versus income and of matching expenses to sale of assets. The law on \"matching\" was in flux at the time. CRA says that all subsequent steps taken by them through collections and appeals were lawful and appropriate. Section 165(1) requires a taxpayer who appeals an assessment to provide reasons for the objection and all relevant facts\n",

The huge penalties in 1995 arose because Mr. Leroux claimed almost $200,000 worth of losses, when he actually had income of $24,000. CRA points out that although a small amount of deductions were disallowed because of the \"matching\" issue, most of the disallowance was because the expenses were not substantiated. (It would seem likely, however, that even if the additional expenses had been substantiated, they would not have been allowed either, given the position Ms. Quance took on \"matching\")\n",

Thus CRA says Mr. Cheung is required to deal only with objections that are properly set out with the relevant facts. Any new assessment issued by Mr. Cheung after the appeal would not have resulted in removal of the judgments filed under the old assessment. The prior judgment would simply have continued to remain on title and been renewed. In any event, the GST judgment would remain because collections actions are not stayed during GST appeals\n",

The court noted that no liability exists for policy decisions, only operational ones. The court found no close and direct relationship between the Registrar and the investor on a consideration of the governing statute, and even if it had, would not have imposed a duty of care for policy reasons.

Many of the cases referred to by CRA deal with whether various kinds of regulators should have a duty of care imposed upon them. In cases dealing with regulators, such as Cooper and Taylor v.

In Hill, the targeted suspect had a critical personal interest in the conduct of the investigation; his freedom was at stake. Torts of false arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution did not provide an adequate remedy. To fail to provide a remedy for \"very poor performance of important police duties\" and other \"non-malicious categories of police misconduct\" would be to deny justice.

      "The argument assumes that the Canada Revenue Agency has no discretion in the way that it assesses any taxpayer, and that in any tort action like this the plaintiff could demonstrate that a particular assessment is \"wrong\". This presupposes that there is only one answer to any income tax question. But the Income Tax Act is long and notoriously complex. In many instances the self-reported tax liability of the taxpayer will call for an exercise of judgment by the taxpayer, often based on professional advice. Likewise, the response of the tax assessor will often require an exercise of judgment and common sense. Sometimes compromises will be necessary, and the dispute will be settled by the taxpayer and the assessor. It would unreasonably interfere with this system of taxation if a third party could later appear and argue that the assessment was \"wrong\"\n",

These positions allowed CRA not only to open up the statute barred years but to assess huge penalties against Mr. Leroux. Yet now that Mr. Leroux attempts to assert that the contrary positions taken in the assessments by CRA were negligent, CRA relies on the reasoning set out above to say their decisions, while perhaps wrong, cannot be negligent\n",

The chambers judge also referred to the Court of Appeal's decision on an unsuccessful appeal by CRA from an unsuccessful application to strike Mr. Leroux's claim in negligence in the present case, but noted that the pleadings in Mr. Leroux's case differed from those before her.

After noting the importance of the statutory framework, the court in Fulkowa went on to say the most basic factor relevant to proximity is whether there is close and direct relationship between the alleged wrongdoer and the victim, citing Hill. The court referred to the existence of a clearly defined group of plaintiffs (as opposed to the public at large), direct and personal dealings between the plaintiffs and the mining inspectors, and statutory duties upon the inspectors directly related to the group as factors establishing proximity.

      "301  The reasoning in Hill is pertinent in the context of the relationship between Mr. Leroux and CRA. An audit may not necessarily place a taxpayer in a close and direct relationship with the auditors. In the vast majority of cases, the required degree of proximity may well not exist. There may not be the extended and personal relationship between the auditors and the taxpayer, the close and direct nexus between the pivotal discretionary decisions taken by the auditors and the harm alleged, or the foreseeably huge and devastating effects of these discretionary decisions on the taxpayer, obvious to the auditors at the time they made them. When all these factors do exist it is not a sufficient answer to say the only remedy available is for the taxpayer to attempt to get the assessment corrected in the Tax Court, thus ensuring that CRA auditors will never be held accountable for their decisions, however careless or devastating they may be\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "302  In this case, the audit was a focussed and intensive one taking place over many years, covering three years of statute barred taxes, involving three auditors, many face to face meetings and phone calls, significant changes in tax characterization between the T-1s and the assessments as a result of discretionary decisions, and huge penalties. The results were foreseeably and obviously devastating to Mr. Leroux\n",

      "303  The close causal connection between the alleged misconduct and the harm is another indicator of proximity, according to Odhavji. The foreseeability of devastating consequences to Mr. Leroux in a general sense was evident to everyone involved at the time the assessment was levied, particularly in view of the extremely large penalties and the daily compounding of interest, even if the specifics of Mr. Leroux's business difficulties were not known to them. The fact that Mr. Leroux had reciprocal and perhaps even more important duties under the Income Tax Act, does not detract from the duty on the CRA employees to conduct themselves as reasonably careful professionals in these circumstances. There is nothing in the statutory scheme of the Income Tax Act that would suggest otherwise\n",

      "304  Applying the test in Anns to this set of facts, it is difficult to see how the employees of CRA could escape an obligation to be mindful of the plaintiff's legitimate interests in conducting his affairs, and to take reasonable care to avoid doing him harm. As well, the close and direct relationship necessary for proximity exists in this case\n",

      "======\n",

      "306  The next consideration is whether policy considerations should prevent a duty of care from being imposed. While there is a duty to the public and to the Minister of National Revenue to collect taxes that are properly payable, as recognized in the cases above, I am unable to see that this duty conflicts with a duty to take reasonable care in assessing taxes, auditing taxpayers, and particularly in imposing penalties. It is true, as CRA contends, that the Canadian tax system depends on self-assessment, and therefore the honesty and full disclosure of taxpayer is crucial. However, within that scheme, CRA is given almost unchecked powers. CRA officials are not accountable to any independent body for their actions, except through an appeal to the Tax Court of Canada. As the Supreme Court of Canada observed at para. 56 of Hill, holding police officers to a standard of care that might make them more careful is not necessarily a bad thing. The same reasoning applies in this case\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "307  As for the spectre of widespread litigation, the battle for any plaintiff in this situation is a steep uphill one, as Mr. Leroux has found. While taxpayers subjected to an audit constitute a larger class as compared to those subjected wrongfully to criminal investigation as in Hill, in order to rely on a duty of care a potential plaintiff must establish the requisite degree of foreseeability and proximity in their particular situation, followed by proven breaches, causation, and damages. Any suit will be rigorously defended with unlimited resources, if the present one is any measure. It is difficult to envision a glut of lawsuits overcoming these onerous burdens. By his own evidence, Mr. Leroux started this action because he was operating under the misapprehension that this was the only way he could get compensation and it would not be hard fought. Those expectations proved to be wrong\n",

      "308  While the plaintiff took aim at every branch of CRA that he dealt with, he seemed to use most of that evidence as background to the real problems he faced as a result of the audit and the resulting assessment, including the penalties. The argument in respect of each branch was not clearly articulated within the legal tests of the cases, but as I understand Mr. Leroux's position, it is that the overall treatment accorded to him over the years by all the branches of CRA falls below the standard set out in Longley: \"to deal fairly and openly with all taxpayers and to administer the Act in accordance with the law\", and that this informs the context in which the actions of the auditors should be considered\n",

      "I conclude that the appropriate standard of care is the overarching standard of a reasonable police officer in similar circumstances. This standard should be applied in a manner that gives due recognition to the discretion inherent in police investigation. Like other professionals, police officers are entitled to exercise their discretion as they see fit, provided that they stay within the bounds of reasonableness. The standard of care is not breached because a police officer exercises his or her discretion in a manner other than that deemed optimal by the reviewing court. ...The standard is that of a reasonable officer, judged in the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made - circumstances that may include urgency and deficiencies of information. ...The law distinguishes between unreasonable mistakes breaching the standard of care and mere \"errors in judgment\" [which do not]\n",

They went through each one, listed them, described them and either accepted them as a business expense or did not, and provided an explanation for each one. Items such as pet supplies, shaving and hair products, restaurant meals (unless bought in Valemount), groceries, candies, ladies clothing and lingerie, toys, tobacco and many other items were disallowed.

Even though Mr. Leroux had a measure of success in some of those areas in the Tax Court settlements, this was because he finally produced documents. The deficiencies in his record keeping and his long delay in producing documents cannot be laid of the feet of CRA in any way. As well, the number of personal expenses included in what Mr. Leroux maintained were business expenses was so extensive that Mr. Leroux cannot complain about the re-opening of those years on the basis of misrepresentations, and the reopening was not the subject of complaint with the Tax Court\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "322  The second area of concern is the characterization of income\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "323  The recharacterization of Mr. Leroux's income for 1993 as between his T-1s and the reassessment comes from Ms. Quance's notes, taken during the initial interview on October 15, 1996. Her approach was apparently adopted and agreed with by Mr. Hansen and followed by Mr. Needham without further investigation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "324  Ms. Quance decided that the income from the logs cleared in 1993 was not capital gains. Both Ms. Quance and later Mr. Needham considered it suspicious that Mr. Leroux reported income in each of the impugned years, but characterized 1993 as capital gains and 1994 and 1995 as business income with associated losses. They did not understand why the logging income should be treated differently in each of the years\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "325  Ms. Quance treated all of the lots as one piece of property for development, although she acknowledged that she was told that different pieces of the property would be used for different purposes. Although Ms. Quance had no information about which portion of the land the logs cleared in 1993 had come from, she testified she was of the opinion that Mr. Leroux was in the business of developing land and therefore the income from the logs must be business income. She acknowledged that Mr. Leroux told her he intended to develop and operate an RV park on part of the land, but repeatedly stated in her evidence that since he bought a large piece of land, he was in the business of land development, even if he was developing different parts of it for different reasons\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "326  Ms. Quance said capital gains is a complicated area and Mr. Leroux had a chance later to make representations when he received the proposal letter. Mr. Leroux did not respond to the proposal letter, but later established during the Tax Court appeal that the logs cleared in 1993 had come from the portion of land to be developed as an RV park, and were thus a capital asset, which was in accord with his T-1 filed in April of 1994 for the 1993 tax year\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "327  Ms. Quance made erroneous and unsupported assumptions in her approach to 1993, but Mr. Leroux did not provide her with any useful information to assist her in understanding why the income from the logs cleared in 1993 should be treated as capital gains. Both Ms. Quance and Mr. Needham could have done more to clarify where the logs came from in 1993. However, Mr. Leroux bears an onus in this situation which he did not fulfil\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "328  Mr. Leroux was asked in cross examination if he ever explained to the auditors that the logging in 1993 was related to the RV park only. He said he explained it to Mr. Hansen when he initially came in to get his GST number in 1993. However, this was never clarified for the auditors in 1996 when it became an issue on the income tax audit\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "329  The problem with the characterization of income for 1994 and 1995 also originates with Ms. Quance. She was in the process of obtaining her status as a Certified General Accountant at the time of the interview with Mr. Leroux. She applied GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) to her characterization of Mr. Leroux's income. Applying GAAP to the 1994 and 1995 years, Ms. Quance decided that expenses incurred in the subdivision could not be deducted from income until the lots were sold. This later turned out to be an erroneous application of the law that was current at the time. The eventual Tax Court settlement was in accord with Mr. Leroux's position on his T-1's filed for 1994 and 1995\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "330  The proposal letter of September 1997, two years before the assessment, had set out the bases upon which CRA intended to reassess Mr. Leroux, but Mr. Leroux did not respond to it and apparently did nothing about it\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "331  In addition, although Mr. Leroux had Deloitte file a Notice of Objection, it was filed in the most general terms. The Notice took issue with the entire reassessment for all three years but included no specific problems, concerns, or disputes\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "332  The accountant from Deloitte who had filled out the 1993 T-1 return had noted \"Prepared without audit from information supplied by the taxpayer\" on the form. The Charles Givens Organization had done Mr. Leroux's taxes in 1994 or 1995, and Mr. Leroux told the auditors that group had lost all his documents (although he later claimed those were copies only)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "333  It is likely Mr. Leroux did not understand the issues surrounding the tax characterizations, but he was given many opportunities to provide CRA with information and he did not do so. It was incumbent on Mr. Leroux to come to grips with the assessment, either himself or through providing full information to Deloitte, and ensure that the issues were properly delineated for the internal appeal\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "334  During the internal appeal, CRA, through Mr. Needham, provided all the working papers and audit reports to Deloitte and Mr. Leroux and received comments back from him. None of those comments related to or contained any information about the issue of the characterization of the 1993 income or the \"matching\" issue for 1994 and 1995\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "335  When the matter was concluded in Tax Court, there was much more information available, both in the way of documents to support business expenses, but also to support the source of the logging in the various years\n",

      "\n",
      "336  It does not appear that Mr. Leroux was deliberately hiding anything - he was cooperative and signed all the authorizations to obtain information. However, he was busy trying to cope with setting up the RV park and simply did not stop and come to grips with what was going on with CRA, nor did he get Deloitte to do so\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "337  The characterization of income based on Ms. Quance's notes, and accepted by Mr. Needham, eventually turned out to be wrong. However, this is not a breach of the standard of care, given the information available to them at the time. The auditors followed their normal processes. The masses of working papers they produced show that they took painstaking care to organize and understand Mr. Leroux's documents. He was given every opportunity to provide more documents and to respond to their concerns but did very little\n",
      "======\n",

      "Penalties and statute barred year\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "339  The large penalties associated with the reassessment arose because Mr. Leroux was found to be grossly negligent. This issue had surfaced during a discussion with Mr. Hansen on June 11, 1997. Mr. Hansen told Mr. Leroux that CRA was statute barred from reassessing him for 1993, but they would be justified in opening up that year and assessing penalties based on gross negligence because of the number of personal items they had found when looking at his claimed business expenses. Mr. Hansen's notes read:\n",
      "I explained that if he was to sign the waiver, there is a possibility that gross negligence would be charged, but that if he did not sign the waiver, we would have to open 1993 due to gross negligence and the penalty would have to be charged\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "340  As already noted, Mr. Leroux did not sign the waiver\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "341  Mr. Needham took over the audit from Mr. Hansen. He was very junior at the time and relied on his supervisor, Mr. Mylnarczyk, to check his work. Mr. Needham's penalty recommendation report states:\n",
      "The amount of expenses claimed on the taxpayer's income tax return greatly exceeded the amount supported by receipts, invoices, and/or other documentation... A prudent taxpayer would have known that these claims were not even close to being accurate.\n",
      "...\n",
      "In 1993, the taxpayer reported a capital gain of $114,783 for the sale of timber from land, which was being developed for resale. The taxpayer stated that he was in the business of developing land. He also stated that the proceeds from the sale of timber were used to finance the development. Thus the taxpayer ought to have known that these proceeds were business income in nature. In addition, the taxpayer has reported the sale of timber as business income in the two subsequent years, 1994 and 1995. This indicates that the taxpayer knew that the sale of timber was business income, and he reported the 1993 sale as a capital gain in order to take advantage of the capital gains deduction and thus avoid tax on substantially all of the proceeds. [emphasis added\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "342  The report goes on to speculate that extra money in Mr. Leroux's bank accounts, which he said were proprietor's loans, were actually earnings from playing in a band, although there was no evidence of this, and Mr. Leroux had been forthcoming and cooperative in his dealings with CRA\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "343  There are a number of problems with the imposition of the penalties in this case\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "344  First, Mr. Needham used the wrong standard for imposing penalties. The penalty section (s. 163(2)) uses the words \"knowingly\" or \"grossly negligent\". Mr. Needham's statement that the characterization of income as capital gains rather than income was something the taxpayer \"ought to have known\" was wrong, a phrase he repeated elsewhere in the report. \"Ought to have known\" is not an acceptable standard. The Minister has the benefit of assumptions in assessing taxes, but bears the burden of proving that a statutorily barred year should be opened, or that penalties are justified. The parties differed on whether this burden was of significance at any stage before the Tax Court proceeding, but regardless of when it arises, CRA must have clear evidence to justify a penalty, including evidence of intent or recklessness; the taxpayer gets the benefit of the doubt (Fourney v. Canada,  at paras. 71 - 81). While Fourney was not available to the auditors at the time this reassessment was completed, the discussion of the test for penalties in that case is based on older cases, the clear wording of the statute, and common sense\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "345  The term \"would have known\" in the context of the business expenses is less objectionable as it implies an inevitable inference arising from established facts\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "346  Second, the penalties were applied to the whole of the income for the various years, ostensibly because the auditors thought the entire characterization of income was grossly negligent. Otherwise they could not assess penalties on the entirety of the income, although it is disturbing that Mr. Needham apparently thought this did not matter. Eventually some of the penalties remained because Mr. Leroux's inclusion of so many personal items in his business expenses and because his failure to document other expenses was simply not defensible\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "347  However, the penalty report purports to cover all of the taxes for each year, including those reassessed as a result of the capital gains and \"matching\" issues. This cannot be so. Those issues, as CRA repeated many times in its defence of Ms. Quance, are complicated. The law was in state of flux regarding \"matching\". To characterize Mr. Leroux's chosen tax treatment as grossly negligent is not simply wrong; it is a misuse of statutory powers, not only to allow huge penalties to be imposed on issues that simply could not be \"grossly negligent\", but to open up statute barred years, which will be discussed further below\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "348  To call Mr. Leroux's tax characterizations \"grossly negligent\" is especially objectionable because, as mentioned above, CRA now uses the complexity of the issues involved in these characterizations as a reason why their decisions on exactly the same issue could never be termed negligent. It is simply not logical for CRA to assess penalties against Mr. Leroux for being grossly negligent in having characterized his income in a particular way and to resist the application of the concept of negligence to their own characterization of the same income, one which was ultimately agreed to be wrong. Or, to put it in the reverse, since CRA now takes the position that the characterization of capital loss versus revenue and the issue of \"matching\" are difficult and complex, it cannot be said that the assumption of contrary positions by Mr. Leroux, positions that were eventually accepted as correct, was grossly negligent. To call them so, and to assess huge penalties as a result, ostensibly for the purpose of getting around a limitation period, is unacceptable and well outside the standard of care expected of honourable public servants or of reasonably competent tax auditors. While being wrong is not being negligent, nor are Ms. Quance's mistakes in fact or law negligent, it is the misuse and misapplication of the term \"grossly negligent\" that is objectionable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "349  The third unacceptable aspect of the imposition of the penalties is that Mr. Leroux was threatened with \"gross negligence\" penalties if he did not sign the statute barred waiver for 1993. He did not sign the waiver, and the unjustified penalties were assessed\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "350  To open a statute barred year, CRA has the onus to show misrepresentation. To assess penalties, CRA must show gross negligence. Conduct that justifies reopening a statue-barred year does not automatically justify a penalty (Fourney at paras. 71-73)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "351  Not only should Mr. Hansen not have threatened the taxpayer with a punitive quid pro quo, but he was not justified in law in equating the two tests. Both Mr. Cheung, the appeals officer, and Ms. Clare, the CRA lawyer at the Tax Court proceeding, did not approve of Mr. Hansen's approach, which was carried through by Mr. Needham\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "352  The penalties for 1994 and 1995 were very high because they were based on the difference between the losses claimed by Mr. Leroux and the eventual tax assessed. It is worth noting that the penalties on the 1995 taxation debt of $5,000 were over $51,000, that is around 900% of the amount of tax payable\n",
      "PERCENT MENTIONED\n",
      "['900%']\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "353  There was no helpful argument presented on the dispute over the interpretation of s. 163(2.1) and whether losses could be taken into account in assessing penalties. Each side just stated their position. While there may be a way of calculating the penalties so one arrives at the reassessed amounts - according to CRA, penalties are calculated on the difference between losses claimed and taxes eventually assessed - the very disproportionality of those sums should have prompted CRA to take a closer look at this file. Instead they simply proceeded with no apparent care or comprehension as to what they were doing to the taxpayer, calling his tax characterizations \"grossly negligent\". CRA must live up to their responsibilities to the Minister and to the Canadian public, nearly all of whom are taxpayers, by applying a little common sense when the result is so obviously devastating to the taxpayer. It is a poor response to say \"we put together our position without regard to the law; leave it to the taxpayer to appeal to Tax Court because we are immune from accountability.\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "354  On top of the huge penalties, there is the continuing spectre of daily compounded interest, which added over $200,000 to the tax debt by the time it got to the Tax Court of Canada. While this is a creation of statute, obviously the auditors are aware of it and the inevitable huge additional burden imposed on the taxpayer. Thus it is even more important that they not act carelessly, thoughtlessly, and without due care, particularly in the imposition of penalties\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "355  In my view, the manner in which penalties for income tax were considered and assessed in this case was a clear breach of the standard of care expected of an auditor of CRA in relation to a taxpayer.\n",
      "Internal Appea\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "356  The third alleged breach is the process used on the internal appeal. As set out above, Mr. Cheung did not take the time to understand or clarify what the differences were between the T-1s filed by Mr. Leroux and the assessment, despite the all-encompassing objection to the income tax assessment filed by Deloitte and the huge penalties. He decided that all of the issues would be clarified by the production of the documents referred to in the GST Notice of Objection filed the year before\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "357  Mr. Cheung's position was that he was not required to look at any ground of appeal that was not spelled out on the Notice of Objection. Mr. Leroux seems to suggest that Mr. Cheung had a duty to go over everything for the three years of his income tax to see if he could come up with anything helpful. I do not accept that Mr. Cheung had an obligation to do that\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "359  There are problems with the internal appeal process, particularly since nothing happened on the GST appeal for over a year and interest was accumulating daily. When Mr. Cheung did turn his mind to the files, he made no attempt to understand the difference between the returns as filed and the reassessments, but simply sent it all back to Mr. Needham. As well, it should have been a simple matter for CRA to send the August 6, 1999 letter again, as requested by Deloitte in the Notice of Objection referred to above. However, Mr. Needham sent all the worksheets to Deloitte and Mr. Leroux made comments on them which Mr. Needham considered before reporting back to Mr. Cheung. Thus there was an open avenue of communication between CRA and Mr. Leroux throughout the appeals process\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "360  Unfortunate as it is, it is up to Mr. Leroux to ensure that CRA understood what he said was wrong with his assessments, and to provide them with all the relevant information needed to support his position. He did not do so in respect of either appeal, and I cannot conclude that Mr. Cheung, faced with the general statements in the Notice of Objection to the income tax assessment, was negligent in not going through all the files to attempt to understand the difference between the returns as filed and the assessments.\n",

Once Thorsteinssons began to deal with Ms. Clare, Mr. Leroux finally produced the missing documentation respecting his contractors and Ms. Clare was able to substantiate input tax credits by using Mr. Leroux's invoices and doing further research. The GST settlement was reached in January of 2003, two and a half years before the income tax settlement\n",

The result was a reduction in GST owing from $82,000 to $57,000 from the original assessment to the final assessment. $16,000 of that was penalties. However, the difference between Mr. Leroux's original filing position, in which he claimed a refund of $18,138 and the final assessment was much greater\n",

Mr. Leroux said the bank refused to give him such a letter as long as the judgments were there. However, the income tax judgment had not yet been registered, and since the purpose of the letter of guarantee was to enable Mr. Leroux to post money to get the GST judgment removed, it does not make sense that the bank would refuse to provide it because of the existence of the judgment if Mr. Leroux had the necessary funds. There was no evidence from the bank about this\n",

Mr. Leroux said all investors refused to become involved once they heard CRA had judgments registered against the property, although both BDC and CRA were open to approaches that would assist Mr. Leroux in this respect. For instance, Mr. Calderon did not agree with Mr. Leroux that BDC refused to discuss receiving security to remove their judgments. As well, in July of 2002, Thorsteinssons received a positive response from Mr. Holmes to their proposal to subordinate CRA's charges to a new lender but this was not followed up with the necessary figures. Another seven months passed before the RV park was sold in February of 2003\n",

      "385  Taking all of this into account, I am not persuaded that Mr. Leroux has demonstrated a causal link between the negligence of CRA in imposing unjustified penalties for income tax which were part of the judgment filed against the property and the impairment of his credit, his difficulties with the mortgage, and the consequent loss of his RV park and home\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "386  Even if there were a link, and the filing of the income tax judgment did lead BDC to foreclose, there was no loss caused by the filing of the judgment that could not have been completely prevented by Mr. Leroux filing an appeal on his income tax assessment. Filing an appeal would have prevented any collections actions, including the filing of the judgment, but Mr. Leroux did not file his appeal for eighteen months, until February of 2002\n",
      "======\n",

      "387  While it appears that Deloitte did make an effort to file an appeal in August of 2001, it was still nine months late, and was after the judgment was already filed. There is no evidence as to when or how Mr. Leroux provided them with instructions to appeal, or why this was not followed up. It was Mr. Leroux's responsibility to appeal on time and he did not do so\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "388  As well, it should have been a fairly simple exercise to alert CRA to the characterization issue for 1993 and the \"matching\" issue for 1994 and 1995, had Mr. Leroux hired Deloitte to investigate the proposal letter or to make proper representations on the internal appeal. The \"matching\" issue was admittedly complicated, but the 1993 capital gains issue could have been usefully discussed if CRA were made aware of the source of the logs\n",

      "======\n",

      "390  Instead it appears that Mr. Leroux did not concentrate in a meaningful way on the issues in the assessments for years. Two years went by between the proposal letter in 1997 and the assessment in 1999. It was another year before the internal appeal was completed and the assessment confirmed in 2000. A further year went by before the income tax judgment was filed against his property in July of 2001, and another seven months passed before the appeal was filed\n",

      "391  An additional argument was made in respect of Mr. Cheung's actions. Mr. Leroux submits that Mr. Cheung should have done a new assessment incorporating Mr. Needham's changes and this would have resulted in Mr. Leroux filing a new Notice of Objection, thus requiring judgments already filed on the property to be vacated. Mr. Needham said the adjustments were about $5,300. In Ms. Clare's proposal, the adjustments, nearly all of which related to GST, were about $5,000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "392  CRA cited Jus d'Or Inc. v. CRA,  to support their position that a new assessment does not nullify a previous collections procedure. In that case an administrative seizure to a bank for source deductions from wages was followed by a new assessment for an even higher amount. That case stands for the proposition that a new assessment does not nullify a previous one if the previous tax is included in the amount reassessed. It does not assist with the issue of the validity of the collections procedures because in that case collection of source deductions was not stayed by an appeal. Also referred to were Alessandro v. Canada, , and Topol v. Canada,  which stand for the proposition that filing an appeal does not require CRA to reverse collections procedures already taken\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "393  Thus while the old assessment would remain valid if replaced by an all encompassing reassessment, and while a subsequent appeal does not invalidate collections actions already taken, it is not clear from these cases whether a judgment registered under an old assessment would be rendered invalid if a new assessment were issued\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "394  However, it is difficult to see how this would have made a difference in this case in any event. The judgment in respect of income tax under the old assessment had not been filed by the time of the Minister's confirmation (August 2000), and was not filed for almost a year (July 17, 2001). While the ability to appeal a new Notice of Assessment would provide another internal appeal, Mr. Leroux could have appealed the Minister's confirmation of his income tax assessment to Tax Court within the 90 days provided by the Income Tax Act and prevented the registration of the relevant judgment, but did not do so until February of 2002. As already mentioned, an appeal of GST does not stay collections proceedings so that judgment would have remained or been immediately replaced in any event\n",

The plaintiff objected to the documents, but actually wanted to rely on many of them, so the court suggested the case proceed with CRA using the affidavits, and if there were points to be made about specific documents, that could be done in argument.

As well, huge and unjustified penalties in respect of income tax were negligently imposed. There were delays occasioned by CRA during which interest continued to be compounded daily. Mr. Crowley recommended a review of the delay which did not occur.

Thereafter he began counseling with another psychologist, Dr. Boissevain, with whom he underwent seven sessions over the next seven months. Dr. Boissevain's treatments were similar to the cognitive therapy earlier provided by Dr. Ellwood, and the plaintiff says he found the mindfulness and meditation helpful for his depressed mood\n",

In spring 2013, he underwent testing for an assessment of upgrading requirements, and it was determined that some upgrading in math was necessary. His plan was to take the math upgrade in the period of May to June 2013, and then enroll in the \"access program\" at Camuson College in the fall 2013. This latter program is designed to prepare students for access to the Electronics and Computer Engineering Technology diploma program at the college. It involved a six-month curriculum of math, physics, and English, as well as computer and electronics study.

This entailed five hours of class work each day, followed by one to two hours of homework. He says he struggled with health problems (the flu-like symptoms referred to above which he attributed to the testosterone shots), and he had an anxiety attack in early December for which he received some counseling from Dr. Boissevain, and also attended a walk-in clinic where his depression medication was increased and an anti-anxiety medication (Pregabalin/Lyrica) was prescribed.

At the time of trial, his plan is to resume the access program at Camosun College in January 2015. However, he is currently continuing to experience low energy, and he thinks it unlikely he will be able to take a full eight subject course load. At current energy levels he thinks he could successfully manage \"maybe two courses\"\n",

The current journeyman rate for electrical work in Edmonton is $37.50 per hour and in Fort McMurray is $42 per hour. One can progress from journeyman status to being a \"sub-foreman/lead hand\", thereafter to a foreman, and then to a superintendent. Lead hands generally make 5% more than the journeyman rate, and a foreman will earn 10% more than the journeyman rate\n",

He confirmed not every journeyman is capable of becoming a foreman, and it is not uncommon for a journeyman to have excellent skills but nonetheless not be foreman material. He also confirmed that it is not uncommon for journeymen to switch fields/areas of practice as they get older e.g. becoming a \"maintenance electrician\" at a facility where the work is mostly with live equipment operations involving regular hours (40 hours a week) for pay that is a little less, but close to the going journeyman rate in the commercial construction field.\n",

      "\n",
      "126  The plaintiff was referred by his counsel to Dr. Semrau for a psychiatric assessment. Dr. Semrau is not one of Mr. Cook's treating physicians. Rather, in preparing his report, Dr. Semrau first reviewed a package of earlier health records, including clinical records and consultation reports from other medical health professionals and a vocational rehabilitation consultant. He then conducted a two-hour psychiatric interview of the plaintiff on April 2, 2014, thereafter producing a 57 page medical-legal report dated June 5, 2014, which was adduced into evidence without objection by the defendants\n",

      "127  Dr. Semrau's evidence can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "the plaintiff was overall healthy and functional before the accident and, had the accident not occurred, it is likely the plaintiff would have continued to do well in terms of his mental health and functioning;\n",
      "as a result of the direct and indirect effects of the January 26, 2010, accident, the plaintiff has developed a Major Depressive Disorder and that, despite treatment, substantial depression has continued which has at times been disabling;\n",
      "the physical injuries sustained in the accident and the related ongoing pain symptomology has led to a loss of self-esteem, discouragement, and demoralization, and a circular reinforcing interaction between disability and depression;\n",
      "the plaintiff also suffers from sleep apnea, which is likely strongly related to the plaintiff's weight, and which is contributing to impaired moods, energy, and mental functioning. The sleep apnea requires further testing and treatment;\n",
      "fatigue is a virtually universal symptom in any significant injury recovery situation, particularly when there is persisting pain. Often there are multiple causes of fatigue, contributing in an additive fashion. In Mr. Cook's case, the most likely explanations for his recent serious fatigue problems are persistent pain, sleep apnea, and depression;\n",
      "the plaintiff 's depression is caused for the most part by the real and substantial ongoing stresses of pain, physical disability, and a disrupted and uncertain educational and employment situation;\n",
      "the serious and chronic nature of the plaintiff's physical symptoms and disability makes the plaintiff's mental health prognosis uncertain but overall very guarded;\n",
      "future mental health treatment for the plaintiff should include antidepressant medication under a doctor's supervision, counseling (10-20 sessions are recommended), and further assessment/treatment of sleep apnea;\n",
      "the direct and indirect effects of this motor vehicle accident have had a major negative impact on the plaintiff's work and educational capacity, but with treatment the plaintiff should be able to find some sort of meaningful occupation in the future\n",

      "collateral sources (family, employers, etc.);\n",
      "medical records; and\n",
      "psychiatric diagnostic testing.\n",
      "Dr. Semrau acknowledged that he had employed only two of the four suggested sources of information (items 1 and 3) and debated with counsel for the defence the utility and value of standardized diagnostic testing in scenarios, such as the present case where multiple physical and clinical symptomology is at play. In his view such testing is over simplistic and no substitute for experienced, in-depth clinical judgment\n",

She was also asked about rehabilitation following full knee replacement surgery and confirmed that, while this can be as little as 3-4 months post-surgery, physiotherapy rehabilitation can sometimes take as long as 12-15 months.

      "140  Dr. Boissevain's impression is that the plaintiff was a compliant, self-reliant patient who did show some improvement as a result of the initial treatments. His impression is that the plaintiff is not completely symptom-free, but the ongoing complaints of fatigue (as of March 2014) were not a mental health issue but rather should be investigated medically\n",

      "144  Dr. Day reviewed a substantial compilation of medical materials respecting the plaintiff's various treatments and assessments since the accident. At the time of his examination, the plaintiff was complaining of ongoing significant disability and was limited in walking to a maximum of four blocks with the help of the cane. He was experiencing significant pain, and the various treatments received to date had not resulted in any significant functional improvements\n",

      "146  Based on his interview, assessment and review of the extensive medical records, Dr. Day opines that the plaintiff sustained significant injuries to his left knee and in particular the anterior cruciate ligament. He believes the significant disability that is now being experienced is directly and causally related to the motor vehicle accident of January 26, 2010. In his opinion, the plaintiff is functionally limited and is not capable of working as an electrician\n",

He does not think bracing or physiotherapy will produce any significantly improved level of function\n",

      "148  On cross-examination Dr. Day confirmed that the total joint replacement surgery produces a dramatic reduction in pain for over 80% of his patients. Indeed, the procedure is perceived primarily as a \"pain-relieving operation\". In addition, while the patient will never regain a full range of motion in the knee and always have some restriction in that regard, the combination of reduced pain and increased mobility allows the vast majority of patients who are not engaged in a heavy physical occupation to return to work\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "152  Dr. Ellwood diagnosed the plaintiff as suffering from a Major Depressive Disorder. The focus of his sadness and pervasive negative outlook was clearly centered on his disrupted professional career, setbacks in expected achievement level, and physical injuries. The plaintiff's mood started deteriorating as his hope for a quick and uncomplicated recovery from his leg injury dwindled\n",

      "154  Dr. Ellwood prescribed a Cognitive Behavior Therapy approach to management of the plaintiff's depressive disorder. This is essentially the same approach referred to by Dr. Boissevain in his testimony and included cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation or, in layman's terms used by Dr. Ellwood, \"thought modification\"\n",

      "\n",
      "156  Dr. Ellwood's opinion is that if the plaintiff's symptoms continued within the mild range of severity, then, although it is a matter of functioning in each case, the plaintiff should be able to work.

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "161  As a result of the above conditions, Dr. Gouws opines that Mr. Cook cannot meet the physical activities of his previous occupation as an electrician. He observes that Mr. Cook has coping difficulties related to his physical and emotional/mood problems, and it is unlikely that his current level of impairment will improve to a point where he will be able to pursue work of more than a light physical demand, or pursue work that requires that he stands for any length of time. In his view, Mr. Cook has very few options left in terms of medical management for his condition, except for interventional total knee replacement, which is not considered a near-term option. He observes that medical/surgical interventions in individuals who have well-established chronic pain conditions often have disappointing results\n",

      "163  On cross-examination Dr. Gouws confirmed that while the plaintiff is totally disabled from working as an electrician, he is not totally disabled from all possible occupations. The whole range of sedentary occupations remain open, including others involving light physical tasks. However, while Dr. Gouws believes there would be significant therapeutic benefit should be plaintiff return to work, he remains quite guarded regarding the plaintiff's ability to do so because he has \"significant barriers\"\n",

      "164  Dr. Gouws notes that the plaintiff was significantly deconditioned with a low aerobic fitness level and a high body mass index. He believes the plaintiff would benefit from an appropriate conditioning and fitness program, which should also be combined with a weight loss program. He observes that the plaintiff's inability to stay physically active and to participate in recreational activities that he enjoyed before the accident has made it hard for him to stay fit. His excess weight is a significant contributing risk factor for his medical conditions including his Type 2 diabetes and sleep apnea. Mr. Cook should make a formal exercise program a priority \"as it is one of the only defences he has to combat his level of pain, impairment and medical comorbidities\".\n",

He again interviewed Mr. Cook on May 13, 2014, over a period of two hours, and the June 7, 2014 report was prepared after a detailed review of the June 5, 2014 report of psychiatrist Semrau.

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "169  In his July 17, 2012 report, Mr. Trainor expresses the opinion that before the accident the plaintiff was\n",
      "... competitively employable as an electrician or in a number of other occupations most likely in fields such as trades, transport and equipment operating; business; sales and services; primary industries; and manufacturing and processing. However the accident has given rise to significant employment barriers that, in my opinion, render him not competitively employable. In other words, there are fewer occupations that are feasible for him and he is not an attractive candidate for employment given, among other things, the significant length of time that he has been off work. If left to his own devices, in the open labor market it is more probable than not he would encounter profound difficulty finding and keeping work. However, if he is provided with some further rehabilitation support, in my opinion his prognosis can be upgraded from poor to guarded. Fortunately, he does possess considerable training potential, which I would see as the way forward for him in terms of improving his employability. In my opinion, a good vocational outcome in this case would be a return to full-time employment in an accommodated position with a sympathetic employer. However, realistically, given the chronicity of his pain, functional limitations and emotional difficulties, the more probable outcome is that he is going to experience difficulty with retraining, finding work and then keeping work\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "170  Taking into account the plaintiff's vocational assets and limitations, Mr. Trainor prepared a list of occupations that, in his opinion, might be within the plaintiff's abilities \"on a non-competitive basis; i.e. with a sympathetic employer who was willing to accommodate as necessary\". One of the occupations listed included the field of electrical and electronic engineering technologist\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "171  By the time of the June 7, 2014 report, Mr. Trainor was aware of the plaintiff's efforts to pursue further education in the area of electronics and computer engineering technology. He noted that the plaintiff \"seems very well motivated to return to college and to continue to pursue his career plan of a career in the electronics field\"; however, the plaintiff \"did express some anxiety about the future and wondered whether he is on the right path\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "172  Mr. Trainor also expressed opinions about the impact of depression on vocational rehabilitation:\n",
      "The majority of depressed persons are able to work, although those who are suffering from a major depression may require a period of absence from the labor force while seeking treatment. Perhaps more significantly, depression is linked in the research literature to problems with: (1) slowness and mistakes in work, (2) poor concentration and forgetfulness, (3) poor timekeeping, (4) increase in unexplained absences or sick leave, and (5) disputes and arguments with colleagues. As a result of his depression, Mr. Cook is more likely to have periods of unemployment and underemployment in his future and he is less likely to achieve the degree of career success that would have been available to him if he was not injured in the subject accident. From a vocational rehabilitation perspective, as a person with physical injuries and depression, the risk of disability is significant i.e. greater than would be the case on the basis of physical limitations alone\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "173  Mr. Trainor's final conclusion is as follows:\n",
      "In my opinion, the vocational prognosis remains guarded given the chronicity of his pain and depression and related unemployment. When I saw him on May 13, 2014 he seems well motivated to get on with his life. I have reassured him that he is on a good track with a viable career plan. The supports recommended in my previous report would, in my opinion, enhance the likelihood of a good outcome, which in this case would be a return to full-time employment in an alternate occupation. However, realistically, given the chronicity of his pain, functional limitations, and emotional problems and taking into account the reality that he has not worked since September 2009, the more probable outcome is one of the ongoing difficulty finding and keeping employment\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "174  On cross-examination Mr. Trainor confirmed that there is currently a good demand in the marketplace for electrical and electronic technologists. He also confirmed that this field tends to be occupied by older workers, and so Mr. Cook's age may not be a barrier to employment\n",

      "\n",
      "175  Mr. Trainor also confirmed that it is possible that the plaintiff may be successful in his retraining program, and that he may be able to return to full-time employment, whether as an electrical/electronic technician or in some other field. He says, however, that there is a lot of \"finger crossing\" (luck and hope) involved in the process and the three requirements for success will be:\n",
      "a realistic occupation in which the plaintiff is interested;\n",

      "\n",
      "183  With respect to the issue of loss causation and how pre-existing risk of loss is to be taken into account, the relevant principles were reviewed and summarized in Hoy v. Williams, , as follows:\n",
      "112 Much judicial ink has been spilled on this subject. Fortunately, a very useful and recent summary of the law in this area can be found in Brewster v. Li,  as follows:\n",
      "[77] In cases of negligence, the plaintiff must establish: (1) that the defendant was the \"cause in fact\" of the damage suffered and (2) that the defendant was a \"proximate cause\" of the damage, \"in other words, that the damage was not too remote from the factual cause. ... The remoteness inquiry assumes that but for the defendant's wrongful act, the plaintiff's loss would not have occurred, but places legal limits on the defendant's liability\" (Hussack v. Chilliwack School District No. 33,  at para. 54, ).\n",
      "[78] The plaintiff must establish causation for both injury and loss. If a defendant did not cause an injury, (s)he is not liable for the losses flowing from that injury. Even if a defendant did cause an injury, (s)he is not liable for any losses or damages that were not caused by the injury. In Blackwater v. Plint,  at para. 364,  [Blackwater BCSC], Chief Justice Brenner, as he then was, adopted the following dichotomy between \"injury\" and \"loss\":\n",
      "\"injury\" refers to the initial physical or mental impairment of the plaintiff's person as a result of the [defendant's act], while \"loss\" refers to the pecuniary or non-pecuniary consequences of that impairment.\n",
      "[79] The basic principle of tort law is that the defendant must put the plaintiff back in the position she would have been in had the defendant's tortious act not occurred (Athey v. Leonati,  at para. 32). The corollary of this principle is that the defendant need not compensate the plaintiff for any loss not caused by his/her negligence or for \"debilitating effects of [a] pre-existing condition which the plaintiff would have experienced anyway\" (Athey at para. 35).\n",
      "[80] Since the burden is on the plaintiff to prove causation, she must establish that the defendant's tortious act caused both an injury (i.e. her pain disorder and/or her depression) and a resulting loss (e.g. non-pecuniary loss or lost wages). \"The former is concerned with establishing the existence of liability; the latter with the extent of that liability\" (Blackwater BCSC at para. 363). In the case at hand, if the plaintiff cannot establish that one of her injuries was caused by the MVA, then she cannot recover from the defendant for the losses that flowed from that injury. Additionally, if the plaintiff cannot establish that the injury caused by the defendant, in turn, caused a certain loss, then she cannot recover from the defendant for that loss.\n",
      "[81] The test for causation in Canada is the \"but-for\" test (Bradley v. Groves,  at para. 37, ; Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke,  at paras. 21-22, ; Blackwater v. Plint,  at para. 78,  [Blackwater SCC]; Clements v. Clements,  at para. 8, ). To assess whether the defendant caused an injury, the trial judge asks if, without the defendant's tortious act, the injury would have resulted. If the answer is \"yes\", the defendant is not liable for the injury or the losses flowing from it (Athey at para. 41). If the answer is \"no\", the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for the whole of the losses flowing from the injury (Athey at paras. 22 and 41).\n",
      "[82] Once causation for an injury is established, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for all of the loss(es) flowing from that injury. The losses \"flowing\" from an injury are those losses which the plaintiff proves, on a balance of probabilities, would not have occurred \"but-for\" the defendant's act (Blackwater SCC at para. 78; Smith v. Knudsen,  at para. 26, ).\n",
      "[83] It is also necessary to recognize that this case engages both \"thin skull\" and \"crumbling skull\" principles. Both these principles were succinctly summarized in Athey:\n",
      "[34] ... The \"crumbling skull\" doctrine is an awkward label for a fairly simple idea. It is named after the well-known \"thin skull\" rule, which makes the tortfeasor liable for the plaintiff's injuries even if the injuries are unexpectedly severe owing to a pre-existing condition. The tortfeasor must take his or her victim as the tortfeasor finds the victim, and is therefore liable even though the plaintiff's losses are more dramatic than they would be for the average person.\n",
      "[35] The so-called \"crumbling skull\" rule simply recognizes that the pre-existing condition was inherent in the plaintiff's \"original position\". The defendant need not put the plaintiff in a position better than his or her original position. The defendant is liable for the injuries caused, even if they are extreme, but reed not compensate the plaintiff for any debilitating effects of the pre-existing condition which the plaintiff would have experienced anyway. The defendant is liable for the additional damage but not the pre-existing damage: Cooper-Stephenson, supra, at pp. 779-780 and John Munkman, Damages for Personal Injuries and Death (9th ed. 1993), at pp. 39-40. Likewise, if there is a measurable risk that the pre-existing condition would have detrimentally affected the plaintiff in the future, regardless of the defendant's negligence, then this can be taken into account in reducing the overall award: Graham v. Rourke, , supra; Malec v. J.C. Hutton Proprietary Ltd., 169 C.L.R. 638, supra; Cooper-Stephenson, supra, at pp. 851-852. This is consistent with the general rule that the plaintiff must be returned to the position he would have been in, with all of its attendant risks and shortcomings, and not a better position. [Emphasis in original.]\n",
      "[84] Recent cases from both the B.C. Court of Appeal and B.C. Supreme Court continue to paraphrase this language. Some examples include: T.W.N.A. v. Canada (Ministry of Indian Affairs),  at paras. 26-37, ; Zacharias v. Leys,  at paras. 13-21, ; Penland v. Lofting,  at paras. 93-97, ; Carr v. Simpson,  at paras. 113-117.\n",
      "113 The T.W.N.A. v. Canada case referred to above was a unanimous decision from a five member panel of the Court of Appeal. It reviewed the principles outlined in Athey v. Leonati, supra, and addressed pre-existing medical conditions and how they affect the assessment of damages. The Athey case articulated the notion of a \"measurable risk\" or \"realistic chance\" of a subsequent medical problem occurring at some point in the future even without the accident that is the subject matter of the lawsuit, noting on that account\n",
      "... a reduction of the overall damage award may [be] considered. This is because the plaintiff is to be returned to his \"original position\", which might have included a risk of spontaneous disc herniation in the future [in any event]. ...\n",
      "(Athey at para. 48, T.W.N.A. at para. 34-35)\n",
      "114 The court in T.W.N.A. held that a defendant need not prove on the balance of probabilities that the pre-existing condition would have actually caused the subsequent loss regardless of the accident. It noted:\n",
      "... a weakness inherent in a plaintiff that might realistically cause or contribute to the loss claimed regardless of the tort is relevant to the assessment of damages. It is a contingency that should be accounted for in the award. Moreover, such a contingency does not have to be proven to a certainty. Rather, it should be given weight according to its relative likelihood. (para. 48)\n",
      "[Underline emphasis added.]\n",
      "115 If the said \"measurable risk\" or \"realistic chance\" can be demonstrated on the evidence, then \"the net loss attributable to the tort will not be as great and damages will be reduced proportionately\" (T.W.N.A. at para. 36 citing Athey paras. 31 - 32).\n",
      "116 Similar principles are articulated in Moore v. Kyba,  at paras. 32 - 37 and where the court also described the operation of the \"crumbling skull\" rule as follows at para. 43:\n",
      "... if the plaintiff had a pre-existing condition and there was a measurable risk that that condition would have resulted in a loss anyway, then that pre-existing risk of loss is taken into account in assessing the damages flowing from the defendant's negligence. ...\n",

      "153 A claim for loss of future earning capacity raises two key questions: 1) has the plaintiff's earning capacity been impaired by his or her injuries; and, if so 2) what compensation should be awarded for the resulting financial harm that will accrue over time? The assessment of loss must be based on the evidence, and not an application of a purely mathematical calculation. The appropriate means of assessment will vary from case to case: Brown v. Golaiy  (S.C.); Pallos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia  (C.A.); Pett v. Pett, .\n",
      "154 The assessment of damages is a matter of judgment, not calculation: Rosvold v. Dunlop,  at para. 18.\n",
      "155 Insofar as possible, the plaintiff should be put in the position he or she would have been in but for the injuries caused by the defendant's negligence: Lines v. W & D Logging Co. Ltd.,  at para. 185. The essential task of the Court is to compare the likely future of the plaintiff's working life if the accident had not happened with the plaintiff's likely future working life after the accident: Gregory v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia,  at para. 32.\n",
      "156 There are two possible approaches to assessment of loss of future earning capacity: the \"earnings approach\" from Pallos, and the \"capital asset approach\" in Brown. Both approaches are correct. The \"earnings approach\" will generally be more useful when the loss is easily measurable: Perren v. Lalari,  at para. 32. Where the loss \"is not measurable in a pecuniary way\", the \"capital asset\" approach is more appropriate: Perren at para. 12.\n",
      "157 The earnings approach involves a form of math-oriented methodology such as i) postulating a minimum annual income loss for the plaintiff's remaining years of work, multiplying the annual projected loss by the number of remaining years and calculating a present value or ii) awarding the plaintiff's entire annual income for a year or two: Pallos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia  (C.A.); Gilbert v. Bottle,  at para. 233.\n",
      "158 The capital asset approach involves considering factors such as i) whether the plaintiff has been rendered less capable overall of earning income from all types of employment; ii) whether the plaintiff is less marketable or attractive as a potential employee; iii) whether the plaintiff has lost the ability to take advantage of all job opportunities that might otherwise have been open; and iv) whether the plaintiff is less valuable to herself as a person capable of earning income in a competitive labour market: Brown v. Golaiy  (S.C.); Gilbert v. Bottle,  at para. 233; Morgan v. Galbraith,  at paras. 53 & 56.\n",
      "159 Though the capital asset approach is not a \"mathematical calculation\", the trial judge must still explain the factual basis of the award: Morgan v. Galbraith,  at para. 56.\n",
      "160 The principles that apply in assessing loss of future earning capacity were summarized by Low J.A. in Reilly v. Lynn,  at para. 101:\n",
      "The relevant principles may be briefly summarized. The standard of proof in relation to future events is simple probability, not the balance of probabilities, and hypothetical events are to be given weight according to their relative likelihood: Athey v. Leonati,  at para. 27. A plaintiff is entitled to compensation for real and substantial possibilities of loss, which are to be quantified by estimating the chance of the loss occurring: Athey v. Leonati, supra, at para. 27, Steenblok v. Funk  at 135 (C.A.). The valuation of the loss of earning capacity may involve a comparison of what the plaintiff would probably have earned but for the accident with what he will probably earn in his injured condition: Milina v. Bartsch  at 93 (S.C.). However, that is not the end of the inquiry; the overall fairness and reasonableness of the award must be considered: Rosvold v. Dunlop,  at para. 11; Ryder v. Paquette,  (C.A.) (Q.L.). Moreover, the task of the Court is to assess the losses, not to calculate them mathematically: Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate  (C.A.). Finally, since the course of future events is unknown, allowance must be made for the contingency that the assumptions upon which the award is based may prove to be wrong: Milina v. Bartsch, supra, at 79.\n",
      "161 The plaintiff may be able to prove a substantial possibility of future loss of income despite having returned to his or her usual employment and even where he has received a raise or obtained a promotion: Perren v. Lalari, supra; Combs v. Bergen, . There is no principle of law requiring the medical evidence to establish an impairment of earning capacity; rather, such impairment is established on the totality of the evidence: Miscisco v. Small, \n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "210  The plaintiff proposes what is essentially a purely mathematical calculation as follows:\n",
      "determine a likely annual income which reflects a foreman's rate, with allowance for overtime and an upward adjustment for non-taxable benefits (accommodation and out-of-town allowances), here calculated to be in the aggregate annual sum of $118,715;\n",
      "deduct an annual amount reflecting the plaintiff's \"residual\" earning capacity following graduation from Camosun College in 2017 and securing employment as an Electrical Engineering Technologist ($53,664, later increased to $67,618), but also factoring in Dr. Semrau's prognosis of a few years of educational/ employment disability related solely to mental health factors; and\n",
      "calculate the present value of the aggregated annual losses to an assumed retirement age of 65 using the recently reduced statutorily mandated discount rate of 1.5%.\n",
      "This calculation generates a figure of approximately $1.2 million which the plaintiff says would be a fair assessment of his loss of future earning capacity in this case\n",
      "PERCENT MENTIONED\n",
      "['5%']\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "211  For their part, the defendants acknowledge that the plaintiff's capacity to earn income in the future has been negatively impacted by the accident, but say that the plaintiff has a significant residual capacity to earn income and that he will, in all likelihood, succeed in his new career in the chosen field of electronic technology. The defendants emphasize that this is not a case where a strictly mathematical approach should be undertaken to assess the plaintiff's losses. Rather, they urge the \"capital asset approach\", which reflects the fact that the plaintiff is not totally disabled, that there are many vocational options available to him, that he will successfully complete his proposed re-education program and re-enter the workforce, and that in any event significant negative contingencies must be factored into the assessment\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "212  The defendants say that, in all the circumstances, a fair award for the plaintiff's loss of future earning capacity in this case would be $500,000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "213  A useful starting point for the evaluation of the loss of future earning capacity in this case is an assessment of what would likely have been the plaintiff's career and employment income if this accident had not occurred. In that regard, given my finding that the plaintiff would have returned to full-time employment in Alberta in the spring of 2010, and given also the significant role played in the plaintiff's self-esteem by his increasing accomplishments as an electrician, it is reasonable to posit the plaintiff continuing in that career for most of the, if not the entire, balance of his working life. It may be, as one of the employers testified, that the physical demands of out-of-town fieldwork on major projects is a \"young man's game\", but the industry also provides avenues for related but less rigorous employment, whether it be as a superintendent or as a maintenance electrician at an indoor facility\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "214  The defendants posits an annual income as an electrician, without allowance for non-taxable benefits, in the vicinity of $87,000 to $90,000. The plaintiff claimed that figure is more properly in the vicinity of $118,000. The present value of such an annual income from the date of trial to the plaintiff's 65th birthday ranges from $1.4 million to $1.85 million\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "215  One possibility, not even discussed by the parties until the court raised it in argument, is that the plaintiff may again fail in his studies and the resulting increasd depression will combine with chronic pain and funectional disability to render the plaintiff competitively unemployable in any field. If that were to occur, the \"arithmetical approach\" to assessing the plaintiff's loss of future earning capacity would warrant an award in the said $1.4 to $1.8 million range before application of contingencies. This, of course, would be a worst case scenario\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "216  The best case mathematical scenario is the one posited by the defendants in argument: the plaintiff will successfully complete his proposed re-education program and re-enter the workforce as a fully employed computer engineering technologist sometime in the year 2017 with earnings in the vicinity of $70,000 per annum. The present value of an annual loss of $25,000 to age 65 would be approximately $392,000, which would then be \"topped up\" for the additional loss of income for the remaining 21/2 years until the plaintiff graduates. This is the arithmetic supporting the defendants' argument that an award of $500,000 for the plaintiff's future loss of earning capacity is a reasonable number\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "217  The capital asset approach to the plaintiff's loss of future earning capacity involves a consideration of the factors identified in Brown v. Golaiy, supra. The plaintiff has chronic pain and significant mobility limitations, both of which may or may not be improved by knee replacement surgery some years into the future. He also suffers from depression and emotional difficulties which will likewise continue into the future. In these circumstances, the evidence establishes that each factor identified in Brown v. Golaiy applies in this case and significantly so\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "218  Whether or not a mathematical calculation is employed as a starting reference point for both pre-accident and post-accident earning capacity, assessment of the loss must also take into account both positive and negative contingencies which should be given weight according to their relative likelihood. Such contingencies must comprise real and substantial possibility and not mere speculation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "219  Positive contingencies for the purpose of this analysis are those that might serve to increase the value of the claim. They include not only those contingencies that would have been applicable to the plaintiff's continued work as an electrician but also those contingencies applicable to future new employment challenges. Such positive contingencies include:\n",
      "the plaintiff may very well have worked as an electrician well beyond the age of 65 (as he stated was his intention);\n",
      "the plaintiff may have received successive promotions to foreman and site superintendent with the related increase in pay scale;\n",
      "the plaintiff's poor physical and mental health may delay and even derail completion of the proposed retraining/re-education and any assumed \"residual earnings\" from such new employment may be delayed, reduced or even not materialize at all;\n",
      "the same physical and mental health challenges may be problematic for the finding and retention of new employment by the plaintiff, as described by Dr. Semrau and Mr. Trainor and/or may result in periods of absenteeism from work again delaying or reducing realization of \"residual earnings\"\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "220  Some of the negative contingencies that should be taken into account and which might decrease the value of loss of future earnings claim include:\n",
      "the plaintiff's pre-existing psychological \"thin skull\" issues (anxiety/panic attacks in scenarios of greater responsibility/stress) may have materialized in any event and resulted in absence from/loss of employment and its related income (although the thin evidentiary basis for this may reduce it to mere speculation, as opposed to a real and substantial possibility);\n",
      "the previous knee injury and the related pre-existing arthritic degeneration in the knee may have resulted in the requirement of knee replacement surgery regardless and thus the end of the plaintiff's career as an electrician in any event (a real possibility, although Dr. Day debated the same);\n",
      "the advent of other non-accident health related problems impairing or disabling employment performance (diabetes, sleep apnea, low testosterone, decreasing energy), possibilities which have actually materialized since the accident;\n",
      "the strong likelihood that knee replacement surgery in the not-too-distant future will substantially decrease or even eliminate the plaintiff's pain, increase mobility, and thereby break the \"vicious cycle\" of mutual symptomology reinforcement identified by Dr. Semrau (a very real possibility, particularly if the \"team effort\" identified by Dr. Gouws is successfully pursued);\n",
      "the successful completion of the plaintiff's \"career plan\" and obtaining long-term employment as an electronics engineering technologist earning an income of the sort posited by the defendants in their calculations\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "221  While I certainly hope that the plaintiff succeeds with his new career plan, I doubt he will do so within the short timeframe that has been suggested. The plaintiff's depression and emotional difficulties underscore the potential fragility of his future aspirations, and his tentative progress to date is very susceptible to derailment. Still, particularly after the knee replacement surgery has occurred, the prospects for successfully treating the plaintiff's mental health challenges should significantly improve, and in turn that should significantly improve his prospects for retraining and securing employment in both skilled and unskilled occupations\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "222  The \"worst-case scenario\" identified earlier in these reasons is not likely going to materialize, but so too is it unlikely that the \"best case scenario\" posited by the defendants will be realized. In my view, a realistic scenario, and one that is fair to both parties in the circumstances, is an award for loss of future earning capacity that reflects a delayed re-entry into the workforce of three to four years while retraining is pursued, and one that reflects a likely 30% reduction in the earnings that would have been realized as an electrician. On a global basis, having regard to all of the evidence as well as the positive and negative contingencies identified above, I assess the plaintiff's damages for loss of future earning capacity in the amount of $850,000.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "224  The defendants agree that the plaintiff incurred the expenses identified in the schedule and also agree that an award of special damages in the aggregate amount claimed is appropriate with one exception\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "225  The exception relates to the prescription of the medication Pregabalin. This is the medication that was prescribed by the physician at the walk-in clinic upon whom the plaintiff attended following his anxiety attack in December 2013. While the amount is small, the defendants seek a ruling on whether the prescription and the need for the medication is properly attributable to the accident. Presumably, the need for the ruling affects not only any cost of future care award for such medication, but also any entitlement on the part of the plaintiff to seek reimbursement of same from the auto insurer, whose disability and medication coverage is at play as a result of the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "226  The defendants claim there is no evidence that the anxiety issues experienced by the plaintiff are related to the accident. They say there is no medical evidence to support the contention that the prescription for Pregabalin results from the injuries sustained in the accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "227  It is correct there is no medical evidence before the court directly linking the Pregabalin prescription to the injuries sustained in the accident. Indeed, since the plaintiff's current family physician did not testify, there is no medical evidence directly supporting the need for the medication in any event\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "228  Having said that, the court is mindful of the comments in Athey v. Leonati, supra, that scientific precision is not always necessary when the matter in issue is a practical question of fact best answered by ordinary common sense. I have already found as a fact that the plaintiff's ongoing depression and his emotional fragility has been caused at least in part (and very probably in whole) by the accident and its medical aftermath. It is only common sense that these mental health related problems caused by the accident can and do contribute to the episodes of disabling anxiety that the plaintiff has experienced and for which medication has been prescribed. It follows that the defendants are liable for the costs of the Pregabalin medication\n",
      "======\n",

      "229  I therefore award the plaintiff's special damages in the amount of $51,256.59, together with pre-judgment interest thereon as prescribed by the Court Order Interest Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 79.\n",

      "======\n",

The second semester of the Access program will cost $1,500 and the cost of the two-year electronics and computing engineering technology program is $14,800. The total is $16,300, which I award as part of the plaintiff's claim for future care/assistance\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "232  While the plaintiff is not presently actively engaged in regular counseling, the defendants themselves submit that he would benefit from this treatment. Dr. Semrau has suggested that the plaintiff will likely require 10 to 20 sessions of further counseling. The amount charged by Dr. Boissevain for the plaintiff's most recent sessions is $170 per session, and I will award the cost of 15 sessions in the aggregate amount of $2,550\n",

      "233  The defendants also agree that active participation in a regular fitness program at a swimming pool and gym facility, and perhaps the occasional assistance from a fitness instructor, would likely help with the plaintiff's overall fitness, weight, pain symptoms, and depressed mood. They suggest an annual cost of $650 is reasonable\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "234  The defendants also agree that continued use of antidepressant medication is reasonable. I have also held that the risk the prescription for anxiety medicine is linked to the accident, and I consider its continued use also to be reasonable. Cymbalta costs $218 a month, and Pregabalin costs $58 every two months. The annual cost is $2,970 per year\n",

      "235  The evidence establishes that there is a high likelihood that total knee replacement surgery will result in a significant reduction in the plaintiff's functional limitations and pain. This in turn may assist in improving the plaintiff's depression and breaking the \"vicious cycle\" referred to by Dr. Semrau in his evidence. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the plaintiff's need for antidepressant medication and assistance with a fitness program will diminish with time, if not be entirely eliminated. The knee surgery is likely required within five years, and so providing for the medication and fitness expenses for a period of seven years is a fair assessment of the plaintiff's future needs in this regard\n",

He was also able to do more sophisticated T-bar ceiling work, and to read blueprints. He worked both as an employee and as an independent contractor. He had left his regular employment with Tri T Wall and Ceiling in about 2009.

The FMEP started pursuing the plaintiff shortly before his marriage began. A court order was entered in November 2006. His common law spouse called him at all hours during the early days of his marriage. His ex-wife described the FMEP proceeding as \"disruptive\", and said that the plaintiff was frustrated and depressed about the process. This led to tensions in the marriage. The marriage effectively ended in October 2012, after the plaintiff assaulted his wife for two hours, and threatened her life. His job had been cancelled that day, which he said was \"the straw that broke the camel's back\" in terms of all the stresses he was facing. He plead guilty to assault, and was placed on probation.

His ex-wife put this at six weeks. He would regularly drink up to a 26 oz. bottle of vodka over two evenings. The evidence was that these alcohol problems did not have any particularly negative effect on his quality of work up to the time of the accident. However, he did miss days of work on occasion.

Mr. Corcoran recommended cognitive behavioural therapy and occupational therapy to address his pain catastrophizing, fear-avoidance and other maladaptive pain management approaches. He concluded that the plaintiff currently presents with the physical capacity to engage in labour or subtrades within light to medium strength ranges, but that he would not be durable with his current mental health presentation.

He also recommended treatment with a psychologist. He expected that this treatment would be of benefit in managing the long-term pain and his Substance Use Disorder.

He noted that in the absence of bony or joint surface injury to the joints, the pain associated with this syndrome is due to an inflammatory reaction, much like a sprain of the ankle or knee. (Dr. Rickards also identified a possible T12 fracture issue, but noted the plaintiff was not presenting with any symptoms in this area.

He noted however that as one ages, a manual labourer will often need to pursue work activity that is less physically demanding, even apart from any accident. He advised that if the symptoms were ongoing, spinal intervention treatments such as medial branch blocks or radiofrequency ablation will usually resolve symptoms. On cross-examination however, he admitted that there is substantial controversy about this proposed treatment approach, and that even the favourable studies show relief in a limited percentage of individuals, less than 60% of those who enter the studies.

However, in cross-examination, Dr. Elliott agreed that: (1) using non-smoker rather than general population statistics, (2) using BC rather than Canada-wide statistics, and (3) accommodating the potential for the plaintiff to decrease his drinking, would each increase the projected life expectancy.

      "Credibility involves an assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness' testimony based upon the veracity or sincerity of a witness and the accuracy of the evidence that the witness provides (Raymond v. Bosanquet (Township) ,  (S.C.C.)). The art of assessment involves examination of various factors such as the ability and opportunity to observe events, the firmness of his memory, the ability to resist the influence of interest to modify his recollection, whether the witness' evidence harmonizes with independent evidence that has been accepted, whether the witness changes his testimony during direct and cross-examination, whether the witness' testimony seems unreasonable, impossible, or unlikely, whether a witness has a motive to lie, and the demeanour of a witness generally (Wallace v. Davis,  (Ont. H.C.); Faryna v. Chorny,  (B.C.C.A.) [Faryna]; R. v. S.(R.D.),  at para.128 (S.C.C.)). Ultimately, the validity of the evidence depends on whether the evidence is consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole and shown to be in existence at the time (Faryna at para. 356)\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "42  If the plaintiff's account of his or her change in physical, mental, and or emotional state as a result of the accident is not convincing, then the hypothesis upon which any expert opinions rest will be undermined: Samuel v. Chrysler Credit Canada Ltd.,  at paras. 15, 49-50\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "43  In this case, despite his scrapes with the law, I found the plaintiff to be generally forthright. The one area in which he was overly defensive and inconsistent was with respect to his drinking, but this is not unexpected in someone whom the doctors agree suffers from Substance Abuse Disorder. His reaction to the accident is in excess of what one would expect, but I conclude this is more the result of the \"pain catastrophizing\" and \"fear avoidance\" noted by the practitioners rather than any actively misleading behaviour. The defendants did not aggressively challenge the plaintiff's fundamental credibility.\n",
      "V. CAUSATIO\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "44  The plaintiff must establish on a balance of probabilities that the defendants' negligence caused or materially contributed to an injury. The defendants' negligence need not be the sole cause of the injury so long as it is part of the cause beyond the range of de minimus. Causation need not be determined by scientific precision: Athey v. Leonati,  at paras. 13-17; Farrant v. Laktin,  at para. 9\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "45  The primary test for causation asks: but-for the defendants' negligence, would the plaintiff have suffered the injury? The \"but-for\" test recognizes that compensation for negligent conduct should only be made where a substantial connection between the injury and the defendants' conduct is present: Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke,  at paras. 21-23\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "46  In special circumstances, the \"but-for\" test proves unworkable, and the law has applied a \"material contribution\" test. As Chief Justice McLachlin wrote in Clements v. Clements,  at para. 46:\n",
      "Exceptionally, a plaintiff may succeed by showing that the defendant's conduct materially contributed to risk of the plaintiff's injury, where (a) the plaintiff has established that her loss would not have occurred \"but for\" the negligence of two or more tortfeasors, each possibly in fact responsible for the loss; and (b) the plaintiff, through no fault of her own, is unable to show that any one of the possible tortfeasors in fact was the necessary or \"but for\" cause of her injury, because each can point to one another as the possible \"but for\" cause of the injury, defeating a finding of causation on a balance of probabilities against anyone\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "47  Causation must be established on a balance of probabilities before damages are assessed. As McLachlin, C.J.C. stated in Blackwater v. Plint,  at para. 78:\n",
      "Even though there may be several tortious and non-tortious causes of injury, so long as the defendant's act is a cause of the plaintiff's damage, the defendant is fully liable for that damage. The rules of damages then consider what the original position of the plaintiff would have been. The governing principle is that the defendant need not put the plaintiff in a better position than his original position and should not compensate the plaintiff for any damages he would have suffered anyway: Athey\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  The most basic principle of tort law is that the plaintiff must be placed in the position he would have been in if not for the defendants' negligence, no better or worse. Tortfeasors must take their victims as they find them, even if the plaintiff's injuries are more severe than they would be for a normal person (the thin skull rule). However, the defendants need not compensate the plaintiff for any debilitating effects of a pre-existing condition which the plaintiff would have experienced anyway (the crumbling skull rule): Athey at paras. 32-35\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "49  In this case, the defendants accept that the plaintiff suffered from facet joint syndrome that was caused by the accident. Furthermore, I conclude that \"but for\" the accident he would not have suffered from the depression, PTSD symptoms, and anxiety. While the Substance Use Disorder also contributed to his psychiatric and psychological difficulties, it is only necessary for the accident to be a material contributor, not the sole contributor. I return to the role of the Substance Use Disorder in terms of establishing realistic baselines below, as it does remain the case that the defendants need only return the plaintiff to his pre-accident condition.\n",

      "[48] ... Whether manifest or not, a weakness inherent in a plaintiff that might realistically cause or contribute to the loss claimed regardless of the tort is relevant to the assessment of damages. It is a contingency that should be accounted for in the award. Moreover, such a contingency does not have to be proven to a certainty. Rather, it should be given weight according to its relative likelihood\n",

      "\n",
      "59  In Polovnikoff v. Banks, , the plaintiff's damages relating to his emotional condition were reduced because of pre-existing and post-accident alcohol abuse, which included binge drinking. Madam Justice Bruce characterized the plaintiff's alcohol use before and after the accident as similar to that of a \"crumbling skull\" situation:\n",
      "[365] The next issue of causation is to determine what role the plaintiff's alcohol consumption played as a pre-existing weakness inherent in his psyche and what role alcohol played in worsening his condition after the July 2001 accident. Based on the evidence before the court concerning the plaintiff's consumption of alcohol before the July 2001 accident, it was an inherent weakness that cannot be regarded as an entirely dormant condition such that it falls within the \"thin skull\" rule. Instead, it is akin to a \"crumbling skull\" situation that at some point in the future could have had an adverse impact on the plaintiff's mental health regardless of the negligence of the defendants. Based upon Dr. Baker's evidence concerning the characteristics of alcohol addiction and the progression of this disease, it is more than just speculation that at some point in the future the plaintiff's mental health may have been adversely affected by his alcohol consumption. Moreover, the fact that the plaintiff increased his use of alcohol after sustaining a brain injury, contrary to the statistical trend for such injuries, increases the likelihood that alcoholism may have in the future led to the symptoms of mental illness exhibited by the plaintiff regardless of the 2001 accident.\n",
      "[366] What is more apparent, however, is that the plaintiff's alcohol consumption after the accident has substantially interfered with the diagnosis and treatment of his psychotic disorder. Since at least 2004 there is evidence of binge drinking and self-medicating with alcohol. There is no cogent evidence that a brain injury leads to alcoholism and Dr. Baker, who is the expert in addiction medicine, testified that the modern scientific view is that alcoholism and mental illness are two independent conditions despite the presence of a large percentage of dual diagnosis patients. Thus while the plaintiff may have increased his alcohol consumption after the 2001 accident to the point where it is clearly causing an adverse effect on his ability to function normally, I am unable to conclude that the defendant's negligence is the cause of this behaviour. While not entirely an unrelated intervening event, it is not causally related to either the brain injury or the mental illness caused by the trauma of the accident. Accordingly, it must be taken into account to reduce the damage award in proportion to its impact on the plaintiff's loss.\n",
      "[367] The impact of the alcohol on the plaintiff's present mental health is not clear on the evidence. Dr. Baker, Dr. Smith, and to some extent Dr. Gopinath, opine that any conclusions in this regard must be based on a lengthy period of hospitalization, during which the plaintiff may be observed, treated and assessed without the influence of alcohol. Nevertheless, because all the experts agree that the symptoms of late stage alcoholism can mirror the symptoms of a psychotic disorder, the continuing alcohol consumption must be regarded as a substantial factor underlying the plaintiff's current mental health difficulties.\n",

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "64  Non-pecuniary damages are awarded to compensate the plaintiff for pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of amenities. The compensation awarded should be fair to all parties, and fairness is measured against awards made in comparable cases. Such cases, though helpful, serve only as a rough guide. Each case depends on its own unique facts: Trites v. Penner,  at paras. 188-189\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "65  In Stapley v. Hejslet, , the Court of Appeal outlined the factors to be considered when assessing non-pecuniary damages at para. 46:\n",
      "The inexhaustive list of common factors cited in Boyd [v. Harris, ] that influence an award of non-pecuniary damages includes:\n",
      "age of the plaintiff;\n",
      "nature of the injury;\n",
      "severity and duration of pain;\n",
      "disability;\n",
      "emotional suffering; and\n",
      "loss or impairment of life;\n",
      "I would add the following factors, although they may arguably be subsumed in the above list:\n",
      "impairment of family, marital and social relationships;\n",
      "impairment of physical and mental abilities;\n",
      "loss of lifestyle; and\n",
      "the plaintiff's stoicism (as a factor that should not, generally speaking, penalize the plaintiff: Giang v. Clayton, )\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "66  The assessment of non-pecuniary damages is necessarily influenced by the individual plaintiff's personal experiences in dealing with his or her injuries and their consequences, and the plaintiff's ability to articulate that experience: Dilello v. Montgomery,  at para. 25\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "67  The correct approach to assessing injuries which depend on subjective reports of pain was discussed in Price v. Kostryba  (S.C.) at 399 by Chief Justice McEachern (quoted with approval in Edmondson v. Payer,  at para. 2). In referring to an earlier decision, he said:\n",
      "In Butler v. Blaylock, [], decided 7th October 1981, Vancouver No. B781505, I referred to counsel's argument that a defendant is often at the mercy of a plaintiff in actions for damages for personal injuries because complaints of pain cannot easily be disproved. I then said:\n",
      "I am not stating any new principle when I say that the court should be exceedingly careful when there is little or no objective evidence of continuing injury and when complaints of pain persist for long periods extending beyond the normal or usual recovery.\n",
      "An injured person is entitled to be fully and properly compensated for any injury or disability caused by a wrongdoer. But no one can expect his fellow citizen or citizens to compensate him in the absence of convincing evidence - which could be just his own evidence if the surrounding circumstances are consistent - that his complaints of pain are true reflections of a continuing injury\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  In this case, I would summarize the significant factors as follows:\n",
      "The plaintiff was 49 years old at the time of the trial and 46 at the time of the accident.\n",
      "The substantial head-on collision caused long-lasting soft tissue injuries and spine facet joint syndrome.\n",
      "The plaintiff's pain has, to this point, disabled him from working in any capacity, and has significantly reduced the quality of his life.\n",
      "The plaintiff suffers from depression as a result of the loss of his ability to work, and to play with his children.\n",
      "The plaintiff's anxiety and physical condition have prevented him from driving, and have made routine chores out in public difficult.\n",
      "While the plaintiff has some prospect for recovery, his prognosis is guarded. Specifically, I find that Dr. Rickard's confidence in the proposed radio frequency ablation treatment is overstated: see Gregory at paras. 56-58.\n",
      "The plaintiff suffered from a pre-existing and active Substance Use Disorder, and he did not seek further counselling for this problem after the accident.\n",
      "Since the accident, the plaintiff suffered from pneumonia, pancreatitis and diabetes, all of which would have occurred in any event.\n",
      "The plaintiff's quality of life was already in a diminished state before the accident, in that he was living with his parents following a marriage breakdown that ended violently, resulting in criminal charges and a return to heavy drinking.\n",

      "Plaintiff's Authorities\n",
      "Sebaa v. Ricci, : The plaintiff was involved in an accident at age 33 (38 at trial). She continued to suffer \"a chronic pain disorder with both psychological and physical workings.\" The prognosis was guarded. There was a realistic possibility that the plaintiff would improve beyond her current state but it was unlikely she would return to her previous level of functioning, mental health, employment, and social engagement. There was no pre-existing Substance Use Disorder or diabetes however, nor had the plaintiff suffered the various legal challenges faced by the plaintiff here. She was awarded $180,000.\n",
      "Kallstrom v.Yip, : A 44-year-old plaintiff who suffered disabling neck and back pain, headaches, and depression as a result of the subject accident. Justice Kent emphasized at para. 352 that the precise label one places on the injuries is largely irrelevant. She was previously a \"happy, successful, active young single mother with a wide circle of friends\" although she \"had some pre-existing issues with pain, depression and sleep, but not to the extent that her lifestyle was significantly impaired\". The court awarded $180,000.\n",
      "Pololos v. Cinnamon-Lopez, : The plaintiff was 41 years old at the time of the accident and 49 at the time of trial. He worked in the construction industry. In the years prior to the accident, he earned $23,000 and $19,400. His earnings for the year of the accident were $8,575 prior to the accident, annualized to approximately $14,000. The accident resulted in soft-tissue injuries to his neck, lower and mid back, bruising on his chest, left arm, pain in both shoulders, arms and elbows, and his tailbone and abdominal pain. He developed sleep disturbance and anxiety, eventually developing depression. Again, there were no substantial pre-existing difficulties that had to be considered. Furthermore, in Pololos, the plaintiff was not able to attend to his personal hygiene, which is not a concern here. The court awarded $180,000.\n",
      "Kim v. Lin, : The 27-year-old plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident. Her injuries included fibromyalgia, chronic pain disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. Her injuries rendered her permanently unemployable in her chosen career as either a dietician or a sanitation technician. There were no material underlying pre-existing conditions. The court awarded $175,000.\n",
      "Defendants' Authorities\n",
      "Lu v. Huang, : The plaintiff was in her 40s, married with one child and employed full time as a senior accounting clerk. She suffered soft-tissue injuries to her neck and back, numbness in her left leg, and nausea. Over time, her nausea and chest pain abated somewhat, but her neck pain and headaches remained the same. She also experienced psychological symptoms, namely depression, which slightly abated by the time of trial. She had issues sleeping. Unlike the present case, the plaintiff was able to return to work part-time after two weeks, and full-time after one year. The court awarded $90,000.\n",
      "Mattice v. Kirby, : The 56-year-old male plaintiff was an automotive mechanic who was involved in a significant rear-end collision. As a result of the accident, the plaintiff suffered chronic soft tissue injuries to his neck and upper back, chronic right ulnar nerve pain, sleep disruption, and psychological symptoms. However, unlike this case, the court rejected the formal diagnosis of depression. The court awarded the plaintiff $90,000 in non-pecuniary damages.\n",
      "Dhillon v. Singer, : The 44-year-old female plaintiff was involved in three motor vehicle accidents. She suffered soft-tissue injuries to her neck, back, and shoulders, sleep disturbances, headaches, and psychological symptoms. As a result of the third MVA, her psychological symptoms were exacerbated to the point that she suffered depression, anxiety, low energy, and issues with intimacy in her marriage. While some of her complaints had reduced by the time of trial, the court concluded that many of her issues were ongoing and likely chronic. However, she was only off work for \"some months\". The court awarded $85,000.\n",
      "Grise v. Jones, : The plaintiff was involved in two motor vehicle accidents. There was evidence suggesting the plaintiff suffered soft tissue injury to his neck, upper back, left shoulder contusion with residual pain and weakness and mild mechanical low back pain. It was unlikely the plaintiff could return to his pre-accident occupation, but there was some indication he could work in a sedentary job. His temperament had changed and he lacked energy and drive. Unlike this case, there were no diagnosed psychiatric disorders. The court awarded $75,000\n",

      "70  I also had regard to the following authorities:\n",
      "Bellaisac v. Mara, : The 29-year-old man suffered low back pain radiating down his legs, had difficulty sitting, walking, standing, and lifting, and suffered depression. However, he was able to work part-time after the accident. The court awarded $140,000.\n",
      "Carver v. Or, : The 62-year-old mechanic suffered from chronic pain. He was found to have no residual earning capacity. The court awarded $115,000, reduced from $130,000 due to some limited pre-existing back problems, and a two-month bout of pneumonia that would have occurred in any event\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "71  Applying the factors above, and with the guidance from the noted case law, I find that the appropriate amount for non-pecuniary damages is $150,000.\n",
      "VIII. PAST LOSS OF EARNING CAPACIT\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "72  The assessment of past wage loss was recently canvassed by the B.C. Court of Appeal in Grewal v. Naumann, . Mr. Justice Goepel wrote the dissent but Madam Justice Smith and Chief Justice Bauman were in agreement on his analysis on this point. Mr. Justice Goepel set out the relevant law to apply when assessing loss of past and future earning capacity and considering hypothetical events:\n",
      "[48] In summary, an assessment of loss of both past and future earning capacity involves a consideration of hypothetical events. The plaintiff is not required to prove these hypothetical events on a balance of probabilities. A future or hypothetical possibility will be taken into consideration as long as it is a real and substantial possibility and not mere speculation. If the plaintiff establishes a real and substantial possibility, the Court must then determine the measure of damages by assessing the likelihood of the event. Depending on the facts of the case, a loss may be quantified either on an earnings approach or on a capital asset approach: Perren v. Lalari,  at para. 32.\n",
      "[49] The assessment of past or future loss requires the court to estimate a pecuniary loss by weighing possibilities and probabilities of hypothetical events. The use of economic and statistical evidence does not turn the assessment into a calculation but can be a helpful tool in determining what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances: Dunbar v. Mendez,  at para. 21\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "73  Compensation for past loss of earning capacity is to be based on what the plaintiff would have, not could have, earned but for the injury that was sustained: Rowe v. Bobell Express Ltd.,  at para. 30; M.B. v. British Columbia,  at para. 49\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "74  The burden of proof for actual past events is a balance of probabilities. An assessment of loss of both past and future earning capacity involves consideration of hypothetical events. The plaintiff is not required to prove these hypothetical events on a balance of probabilities. The future or hypothetical possibility will be taken into consideration as long as it is a real and substantial possibility and not mere speculation: Athey at para. 27; Morlan v. Barrett,  at para. 38\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "75  Mr. Zwinge's reported income is outlined above. As noted, the average for the last five full years was about $32,000. This figure is somewhat inflated in that the plaintiff did not claim his full business expenses for gas, use of his vehicle, or tool repair, either due to lack of knowledge or the loss of his receipts: Grise at para. 25\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "76  The plaintiff suggested that this amount should be increased as high as $48,000 because the plaintiff was working to get his drinking under control prior to the accident, and the five-year sample included the disintegration of his second relationship. But given that his earnings had actually been decreasing over the last three full years, and the plaintiff's alcohol intake had fallen and risen several times before, I see no basis for assuming that his income would have increased substantially from the five-year average for the years preceding the accident. Using the average already ignores the downward trend. As noted above, the question is what he would have achieved, not what he could have achieved under ideal conditions\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "77  Taking all these factors into account, I find that using $32,000 is a reasonable baseline for the assessment of past income loss. Further, by not imposing an express deduction to reflect unclaimed business expenses, it reflects a modest positive contingency in favour of the plaintiff's potential capacity after the marriage breakup. The effect of the pre-existing alcohol abuse problems and other family issues, such as the troubles with FMEP, are already embedded in the actual pre-accident history, such that no further deduction is required on that basis\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "78  This was a significant accident and injury, and one could expect a meaningful period of recovery. The recovery has been longer and more difficult than expected primarily due in part to the overlay of both the psychiatric and psychological conditions, but I find that the accident did materially contribute to these conditions\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "79  The plaintiff's economist Darren Benning illustrated a past wage loss claim of $88,560, using the $32,000 baseline for income. However, this calculation failed to account for $9,133 in retroactive CPP payments that should come back into the analysis. Hence, I would award $97,693 for past income loss, plus applicable interest.\n",
      "IX. LOSS OF FUTURE EARNING CAPACIT\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "80  The legal principles relevant to determining future loss of earning capacity were recently and neatly summarized by Mr. Justice Voith in Pololos v. Cinnamon-Lopez,  at para. 133:\n",
      "To the extent possible, a plaintiff should be put in the position he/she would have been in, but for the injuries caused by the defendant's negligence; Lines v. W & D Logging Co. Ltd.,  at para. 185, leave to appeal ref'd ;\n",
      "The central task of the Court is to compare the likely future of the plaintiff's working life if the Accident had not occurred with the plaintiff's likely future working life after the Accident; Gregory v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia,  at para. 32;\n",
      "The assessment of loss must be based on the evidence, but requires an exercise of judgment and is not a mathematical calculation; Rosvold v. Dunlop,  at para. 18;\n",
      "The two possible approaches to assessment of loss of future earning capacity are the \"earnings approach\" and the \"capital asset approach\"; Brown v. Golaiy  at para. 7 (S.C.); and Perren v. Lalari,  at paras. 11-12;\n",
      "Under either approach, the plaintiff must prove that there is a \"real and substantial possibility\" of various future events leading to an income loss; Perren at para. 33;\n",
      "The earnings approach will be more appropriate when the loss is more easily measurable; Westbroek v. Brizuela,  at para. 64. Furthermore, while assessing an award for future loss of income is not a purely mathematical exercise, the Court should endeavour to use factual mathematical anchors as a starting foundation to quantify such loss; Jurczak v. Mauro,  at paras. 36-37.\n",
      "When relying on an \"earnings approach\", the Court must nevertheless always consider the overall fairness and reasonableness of the award, taking into account all of the evidence; Rosvold at para. 11\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "81  The relevant principles were also summarized by our Court of Appeal in Reilly v. Lynn,  at para. 101:\n",
      "The relevant principles may be briefly summarized. The standard of proof in relation to future events is simple probability, not the balance of probabilities, and hypothetical events are to be given weight according to their relative likelihood: Athey v. Leonati,  at para. 27. A plaintiff is entitled to compensation for real and substantial possibilities of loss, which are to be quantified by estimating the chance of the loss occurring: Athey v. Leonati, supra, at para. 27, Steenblok v. Funk  at 135 (C.A.). The valuation of the loss of earning capacity may involve a comparison of what the plaintiff would probably have earned but for the accident with what he will probably earn in his injured condition: Milina v. Bartsch  at 93 (S.C.). However, that is not the end of the inquiry; the overall fairness and reasonableness of the award must be considered: Rosvold v. Dunlop ,  at para. 11; Ryder v. Paquette,  (C.A.) (Q.L.). Moreover, the task of the Court is to assess the losses, not to calculate them mathematically: Mulholland (Guardian ad litem of) v. Riley Estate  (C.A.). Finally, since the course of future events is unknown, allowance must be made for the contingency that the assumptions upon which the award is based may prove to be wrong: Milina v. Bartsch, supra, at 79\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "82  This is the first head of damage that requires consideration of the proper approach to life expectancy. I have used Mr. Benning's figures for a life expectancy to age 75 in light of the following:\n",
      "I find that on the basis of the evidence presented, a combination of the plaintiff's Substance Use Disorder, diabetes, and chronic pain can reasonably be expected to cause a material impact on life expectancy. While I agree with the plaintiff that the court should not encourage the necessity of expert reports for marginally decreased life expectancy, the combination of all three factors here is sufficiently material to support a deduction.\n",
      "I do not conclude that the B.C. tables must be used in all cases in B.C. The question of life expectancy will always be a question of fact: Sangra (Guardian ad litem of) v. Lima,  at para. 199. In this particular case, the plaintiff was born in Ontario. Dr. Elliott noted that one of the reasons to use national data within Canada is the ease of mobility across the country. Further, to the extent that heredity is a factor in life expectancy, the plaintiff presumably possesses certain Ontario-based characteristics.\n",
      "That said, I am prepared to increase the projected life expectancy beyond the defence's suggestion of 69-70 years, given that the plaintiff is a non-smoker, he did live most of his life in B.C., and there is a substantial possibility of the plaintiff being able to improve his life expectancy through a reduction in his drinking\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "83  I conclude that the appropriate award under this head of damage is $400,000. This is based on the following analysis:\n",
      "I see no basis for concluding that the plaintiff was ever going to make a material jump upwards in his earnings from the approximately $32,000/year he was making in the years prior to the accident. This time period overlapped with a relatively good period in the industry since the run up to the 2010 Olympics. As Mr. Rehm advised, the construction business is cyclical.\n",
      "Again, by using the plaintiff's actual pre-accident performance as a base, that reasonably incorporates the plaintiff's material non-accident related issues, including the medical issues such as diabetes, alcohol abuse, pancreatitis, and gout, as well as the social issues such as his criminal record and his job-shifting efforts to avoid the large outstanding support obligation. It also allows the court to use the actuarial multiplier rather than the economic multiplier, since the actual earnings incorporate the effect of general economic risks in a way that is more specific to the plaintiff's own history.\n",
      "I conclude that it would be difficult for a manual labourer such as the plaintiff to have worked in his position much beyond the age of 65. This conclusion was supported by the evidence of Mr. Rehm, who advised that the work is difficult to sustain after the \"wear and tear\" of many years. The plaintiff may have wanted to work after age 65. However, it is difficult to see how he would have been able to do so beyond that age, even with a lighter duty \"T-Bar ceiling\" focus. There are few if any full time management positions for persons of his educational level that would have avoided the need to do any demanding physical work.\n",
      "I find that the injuries incurred in the accident are such that it is unlikely that he will be able to return to the heavy work he was performing prior to the accident.\n",
      "However, now that the impecuniosity concerns will be removed through the fruits of this judgment, the plaintiff will be in a position to pursue the various treatments recommended by the experts. Once the behavioural and occupational therapy proposed under the future cost of care award below is received, there is a substantial possibility that the plaintiff could find his way back into the work force, at least in a light to medium level minimum wage position on a part time basis, and with assistance from a vocational counsellor. The plaintiff has shown himself to be a good worker, an intelligent individual notwithstanding his limited education, and a motivated person when presented with achievable opportunities. If he can finally get the help he needs, I believe he has a reasonable prospect of pursuing the dignity that will be gained from performing even limited work.\n",
      "A part time minimum wage position commencing after September 2017 would yield about $12,000 per year on a 20 hours/week basis. I conclude that this is the most that can be reasonably projected given his age, education, and present condition.\n",
      "Securing any employment will be difficult, particularly at his age and with his constellation of challenges. I expect it will be some time before he is able to pursue any type of employment. There will likely be gaps in employment thereafter. As such, I apply a 50% contingency to the $12,000 per year, reducing it for assessment purposes to $6,000. I also expect that it will take the plaintiff about two years to put himself on sufficiently solid footing to pursue this limited type of employment.\n",
      "Using a life expectancy to age 75, a loss of $32,000 for the next two years (during the most intense treatment efforts), and then a net loss of $26,000 per year through to retirement at age 65, yields $388,166, calculated using Table 4B of Mr. Benning's July 13, 2016 report using the following formula for the actuarial multiplier: (1965X32) + (14476-1965)X26)\n",
      "PERCENT MENTIONED\n",
      "['50%']\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "84  Hence, applying all the relevant factors, I find that $400,000 is a reasonable assessment of loss of future earning capacity.\n",
      "X. COSTS OF FUTURE CAR\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "85  In Peters v. Ortner, , Madam Justice Harris outlined the general principles to consider when assessing a plaintiff's cost of future care:\n",
      "[141] The plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the cost of future care based on what is reasonably necessary to restore him to his pre-accident condition in so far as that is possible. The award is to be based on what is reasonably necessary on the medical evidence to preserve and promote the plaintiff's mental and physical health: Milina v. Bartsch  (S.C.); Williams v. Low, ; Spehar v. Beazley, ; Gignac v. Rozylo, .\n",
      "[142] The test for determining the appropriate award under the heading of cost of future care is an objective one based on the medical evidence. For an award of future care: there must be a medical justification for claims for cost of future care and the claims must be reasonable: Milina; Tsalamandris v. McLeod,  at paras. 62-63\n",
      "[143] Future care costs are \"justified\" if they are both medically necessary and likely to be incurred by the plaintiff. The award of damages is thus a matter of prediction as to what will happen in the future. If a plaintiff has not used a particular item or service in the past it may be inappropriate to include its cost in a future care award. However, if the evidence shows that previously rejected services will not be or be able to be, rejected in the future, the plaintiff can recover for such services: Izony v. Weidlich,  at para. 74; O'Connell v. Yung,  at paras. 55, 60, 68-70.\n",
      "[144] The extent, if any, to which a future care costs award should be adjusted for contingencies depends on the specific care needs of the plaintiff. In some cases negative contingencies are offset by positive contingencies and, therefore, a contingency adjustment is not required. In other cases, however, the award is reduced based on the prospect of improvement in the plaintiff's condition or increased based on the prospect that additional care will be required. Each case falls to be determined on its particular facts: Gilbert v. Bottle,  at para. 253\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "86  An assessment of damages for cost of future care is not a precise accounting exercise: Krangle (Guardian ad litem of) v. Brisco,  at para. 21\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "87  Here, I conclude that the plaintiff does require the spectrum of non-medication supports proposed by Mr. Corcoran in order to be restored as close as possible to his pre-accident condition. These were valued at $48,107 at a normal life expectancy. The plaintiff noted Dr. Janke's comment that he \"may well\" require ongoing supportive treatment \"if\" he continues to experience significant physical symptoms. I do not find that this doubly qualified recommendation is sufficiently definitive to require an enhancement to the estimate\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "88  The defence challenged the cost of medications on the basis that the medical practitioners seem to accept that these are going to need to be reviewed. The plaintiff proposed to reduce this claim from $56,703 to $30,000 in their final argument\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "89  The defence challenged the need for physiotherapy on the basis that the pain relief provided to date was only temporary: Hollyer v. Gaston,  at para. 129. However, the plaintiff noted that the nature of the proposed future treatment was more directed to achieving lasting results. Furthermore, in Rayner v. David,  at para. 49, the court stated:\n",
      "Massage provides temporary relief from his symptoms. In Milina v. Bartsch  (S.C.), the Court said that an award for future care is based on what is reasonably necessary on the medical evidence to promote the physical and mental health of the plaintiff. Massage therapy is something that the plaintiff has engaged in and it does provide him temporary relief\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "90  I accept that the physiotherapy proposed here is reasonably necessary\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "91  I also note that the defendant did not take the position that any of the care amounts claimed were related solely to the treatment of the Substance Use Disorder. I agree\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "92  Hence:\n",
      "using as a base the present value calculation proposed by the plaintiff's economist Mr. Benning;\n",
      "accepting the plaintiff's reduction to the proposed future medication costs;\n",
      "adjusting downwards for the life expectancy issue, and\n",
      "acknowledging the direction that this assessment is not a precise accounting exercise,\n",
      "I award $70,000 under this head of damage.\n",
      "XI. SPECIAL DAMAGE\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "93  It is well established that an injured person is entitled to recover the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses he or she incurred as a result of an accident. This is grounded in the fundamental governing principle that an injured person is to be restored to the position he or she would have been in had the accident not occurred: X. v.

      "1  The plaintiff, Mr. Chow, is the unfortunate victim of two motor vehicle accidents, neither of which was his fault. The first accident took place in 2002. The plaintiff's vehicle was struck and the impact threw it onto the sidewalk. He suffered significant injuries to his neck, left shoulder, upper and lower back, and most significantly to his lower left quadrant, leaving him with a serious, debilitating chronic pain syndrome\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "2  The 2002 accident was the subject of a trial before Arnold-Bailey J., in April 2006. It settled on the fifth day of trial for a substantial lump sum in satisfaction of all the plaintiff's claims from the date of the accident into the future for income loss, pain and suffering, and cost of care\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "3  On October 30, 2008, the plaintiff was involved in the motor vehicle accident which is the subject of this action. At about 1:05 p.m. on Ferry Street in Prince George, the plaintiff was rear ended by the defendant. The plaintiff had been stopped at a red light waiting to turn left. His young daughter was strapped in her car seat in the back. The defendant, Paul Nolan, a taxi driver who drove with his left foot on the brake and his right foot on the gas, was momentarily distracted. His car crept closer to the plaintiff. Meaning to brake, the defendant inadvertently put his foot on the gas and accelerated two to three feet into the plaintiff's bumper at a speed of about five or six kilometres per hour\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "4  The damage to the plaintiff's vehicle was insignificant, consisting primarily of a bolt from the defendant's licence plate becoming embedded into the vehicle's bumper. However, the plaintiff had been holding the steering wheel with both hands and was stunned, shaken and surprised. He told the defendant driver that he thought something was \"wrong\" with him\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "5  No ambulance or police were called. The parties exchanged information and the plaintiff went home with his daughter. About an hour later he took his daughter to their family physician, Dr. Javed. While there, the plaintiff broke out into a full body spasm and was taken to hospital by ambulance\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "6  The defendants concede that the defendant driver was liable for the accident and that the plaintiff suffered soft tissue injuries in the accident which caused him aggravated neck and back pain for a time, and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. In turn, the plaintiff concedes that his chronic pain syndrome, which takes the form of full body spasms akin to seizures, is a result of the severe injuries he had received in the 2002 accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "7  The parties join issue on whether the 2008 accident aggravated the plaintiff's chronic pain syndrome, and what effect, if any, this had on his functional capacity and quality of life\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "8  The plaintiff submits that the 2008 accident significantly aggravated his chronic pain syndrome and impacted on his daily living. Whereas before the 2008 accident he enjoyed three to four days a week of almost normal function, he now only realizes one to two \"good\" days a month. This translates into losses incurred by the plaintiff under all heads of damage\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "9  The defendants maintain that the plaintiff has not proved that the worsening of his pre-existing chronic pain condition was caused by the 2008 accident. Alternatively, the defendants submit that even if I should find that the 2008 accident caused some exacerbation of the plaintiff's chronic pain condition, the plaintiff's damage claims are unreasonable and do not properly take into account his original position.\n",
      "II. THE EVIDENCE\n",
      "A. Credibilit\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "10  In my view, the best evidence of the plaintiff's condition and status both before and after the October 2008 accident is found in the documentary record created at the time of the April 9, 2006 trial, in the period between April 2006 and October 30, 2008, and from October 30, 2008, to the present\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "11  The viva voce evidence of the plaintiff given at trial before me is less reliable. As a witness, the plaintiff had a tendency to analyze, speculate and reconstruct events. When inconsistent statements from his examination for discovery were put to him at trial, he claimed that he had not been thinking clearly during his examination for discovery because of his medication and chronic pain. He said that the examination for discovery answers, therefore, were rife with inaccuracies. At trial, I found the plaintiff to be articulate and precise in his answers, notwithstanding that he testified he was on medication and in chronic pain during trial. However, if I accept his excuse that his condition and medication caused him to be inaccurate in his previous inconsistent statements made under oath at examination for discovery or made in writing to ICBC, then I must also consider the effect of his condition and medications on the recounting of events in the many oral statements made to his medical practitioners over the years, and on his testimony given at trial before me\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "12  Thus I give less weight to the evidence of the plaintiff where unsupported or contradicted by the documents or evidence of other credible witnesses.\n",
      "B. The Plaintiff's Original Positio\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "13  Before the plaintiff's damages can be assessed, his pre-existing, or original condition as it was in October 2008, before the accident, must be determined and juxtaposed with his post-accident condition. This allows for an analysis of the cause of the differences, if any. If the plaintiff establishes that the worsening of his condition was caused by the 2008 accident, this juxtaposing of condition before and after the 2008 accident also allows for the measurement of any risk of debilitation that the manifest and disabling condition might have effected in any event (Athey v. Leonati, )\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "14  The plaintiff submits that the medical cause of his chronic pain syndrome was never accurately diagnosed, despite the many specialists who examined the plaintiff between 2002 and 2008. In his written submissions, plaintiff's counsel describes the plaintiff's condition as:\n",
      "... totally disabling chronic pain. The severe attacks are similar to a seizure. The typical sequence starts with Mr. Chow having involuntary muscle spasms, which cause rather severe jerking motions to his whole body but primarily from his waist to his head. As the seizure progresses and the pain increases, the jerking movements reduce and Mr. Chow becomes doubled over in pain into a fetal position. He will be moaning and crying out loud at this stage of his seizure\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "15  Having reviewed the video evidence in court, I find that counsel's description of the plaintiff's seizure-like, full body spasms to be fairly accurate. There was no medical evidence with respect to the difference, if any, of the full body spasms exhibited in the 2006 DVD from the 2013 DVD. On the DVDs, they appear to be of the same type and intensity\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "16  For purposes of the 2006 trial before Arnold-Bailey J., Dr. Gill prepared a 28-page medical legal report dated January 13, 2006, and a follow-up report dated August 29, 2006. Highlights of those reports included the following:\n",
      "[January 13, 2006 report]\n",
      "As a result of this motor vehicle accident [2002] Mr. Chow sustained multiple myofacial strains. More specifically ... cervical paraspinal muscles, the tripezius muscles, the thoracic paraspinal muscles and the lumbar paraspinal muscles. In addition the left hip flexor muscles as well as the muscle of the left lower abdominal wall were involved. The injuries to the neck and upper back regions have improved significantly. Though some partial disability continues to remain as a result of injury to the structures almost complete resolution has occurred. Mr. Chow's condition has plateaued in respect to these injuries and thus I expect that Mr. Chow will continue to have some partial disability as a result of these injuries. Mr. Chow's low back region remains much more problematic. He continues to display significant levels of disability as a result of injury to this area ...\n",
      "More significantly Mr. Chow continues to have markedly severe left hip and abdominal wall pain. He has ongoing pain to this region continually and experiences episodes of extremely severe pain three to four times per month. Initially one could determine an aggravating factor in the causation of these episodes; more recently sometimes they seem to occur with no aggravating factor. ...\n",
      "Mr. Chow also remains very significantly depressed ... profoundly depressed. His sleep remains poor. He is very fatigued. His memory and concentration are diminished. His moods remain labile and very low. ...\n",
      "Mr. Chow also has significant erectile dysfunction. The cause of this multi-factorial. Pain is most definitely a significant factor as is the depression. Medications may also be contributing. ...\n",
      "Mr. Chow unfortunately has become opiate dependent. We will have to wean Mr. Chow off the injectible Demerol and the short-acting Dilaudid. ...\n",
      "I anticipate that Mr. Chow will never be pain free ... Mr. Chow remains permanently and totally disabled. I do not see him being able to return to the workplace in any capacity. He remains unable to lift or carry anything greater than approximately 10 to 15 pounds. He remains restricted in his ability to bend or twist his torso. He is restricted from prolonged sitting, standing, walking and driving. His memory and concentration are also severely restricting his ability to work. Mr. Chow is also restricted from performing any heavy household cleaning and yard work.\n",
      "[August 29, 2006 report]\n",
      "Mr. Chow's symptoms have not changed ... continues to have very extreme attack of left hip and groin pain. These occur approximately three to four times per month. ... very little has changed in these attacks since they were first noted shortly after the [2002] motor vehicle accident]. ...\n",
      "It is evident that Mr. Chow has plateaued and I do not anticipate that he will make any further gains. ... Mr. Chow remains totally and permanently disabled ... I do not feel that Mr. Chow is now fit or will be fit ever in the future for any gainful employment\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "17  In 2006, Dr. Gill was of the opinion that the chronic pain was musculoskeletal in origin\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "18  In his January 14, 2013 report prepared for this trial, Dr. Gill stated that by October 2008 the plaintiff's condition was stable. Dr. Gill reported that the frequency of the plaintiff's chronic pain attacks had decreased, but not stopped. This latter statement is not supported by the documentary evidence as will be seen further on\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "19  Dr. Griffin, psychiatrist, in his medical legal report of November 9, 2006, stated that the plaintiff reported that his sex life was virtually absent since the accident, he had severe difficulties with concentration and processing memory and was experiencing painful spasm crises four to six times a month and the frequency was increasing\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "20  Dr. Meloche, in his consultation report of June 5, 2008, stated that the plaintiff was left with discomfort in his lower abdomen and upper thigh that was \"pretty much unchanged\" since the 2002 accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "21  Dr. Sable, psychiatrist, in his May 23, 2006 report, stated that the plaintiff complained of chronic daily pain on a three out of four to four out of six level, and sometimes more for which he had been taking Dilaudid. The plaintiff told Dr. Sable that over the previous five months the \"injections and frequency of his need for opioids had increased.\" His sleep was poor; he was having difficulty with concentration and memory, and with libido and erectile dysfunction\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "22  Dr. O'Connor, in his report of December 10, 2007, referred to ongoing left side pain which worsened after the surgery in 2004. He also referred to ongoing difficulties with erectile dysfunction and decreased short-term memory\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "23  The plaintiff submits that before October 2008, his seizures could be brought under control by injections of Demerol which eventually dulled the pain. The plaintiff testified that he would have side effects including fatigue, dizziness and inability to concentrate, for a day or infrequently as long as 48 hours. The plaintiff also testified that before the 2008 accident the attacks occurred four to six times per month\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "24  The submission and testimony at trial of the plaintiff does not accord with the charts of full body spasms and Demerol injections prepared by the plaintiff and his wife contemporaneously from January 2007 to April 2013. These charts indicate that the plaintiff experienced 61 full body spasms in 2008 before the accident, or approximately six full body spasms per month on average. Furthermore, the plaintiff said on examination for discovery it took him three days to get over the side effects. He refused to adopt this discovery evidence at trial, saying it was only one or two days. Mr. Willy Chow, the plaintiff's brother, deposed that it would take the plaintiff a couple of days to get rid of the effects of the attack and the Demerol\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "25  The plaintiff's charts also showed that the full body spasms and Demerol shots were on the increase in 2008 from 2007. The attacks in 2007 averaged four times per month and the shots averaged five shots per month, as compared with an average of six attacks and seven shots per months in the 2008 year before the October accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "26  I conclude, on the whole of the evidence, that in the time period shortly before the accident on October 30, 2008, the pattern of the plaintiff's full body spasms and corresponding need for Demerol shots was rising slowly with no improvement in the foreseeable future. He continued to attend on Dr. Gill every three to four months for pain and narcotics management. His other injuries from the 2002 accident had substantially resolved except for intermittent muscle strains to his neck, back and extremities from over activity\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "27  I find that it was more likely than not that before the 2008 accident the plaintiff was \"out of commission\" approximately 12 days per month and able to function at a better level on the other days. On these \"better\" days, he was capable of light housekeeping, shopping, laundry, some yard work and lots of cooking. The Chows had moved to Prince George in 2006 and their new life there seemed to agree with the plaintiff and improve his mood. Mr. Chow had grown up in Prince George and he socialized on his better days with old friends and family. His daughter started kindergarten in 2008 and the Chows made new friends with classmate parents\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "28  After he moved to Prince George, the plaintiff took on the role as skip on a curling team, and transported or accompanied his daughter to school and extracurricular activities. He took out a commission to perform marriages. In the spring of 2008 he performed some part-time clerical work for his wife's then employer. Also, on occasion, he cleaned and polished his cars and walked his Sheltie dog. Sometimes these activities caused him increased pain or triggered full body spasms, so he created strategies to assist himself such as using specialized equipment or performing at a slower pace.\n",
      "C. Post-2008 Accident Conditio\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "29  Within a couple of hours of the accident on October 30, 2008, the plaintiff was experiencing a full body spasm. The plaintiff submits that from then on his attacks increased to 12 to 15 times per month and later to 30 times per month. The plaintiff submits that the initial increase in attacks caused his Demerol consumption to rise to the point that Dr. Gill stopped prescribing it in August 2009. Since then the plaintiff and Dr. Gill have experimented with a new drug regime that is less effective with greater side effects. Therefore the plaintiff, except on rare occasions, no longer cooks, does chores, drives his daughter, mows his lawn, removes snow or walks his dogs. His social life has diminished considerably, and he is unable to perform ad hoc office work\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "30  In my view, these submissions present an overly simplified picture of the evidentiary record. The Chows' charts definitely show an increase in full body spasms and drug consumption after the accident, but it is not a straight rise. After the accident, for the first 10 months until the plaintiff was taken off Demerol, he averaged about 15 attacks and 20 shots per month. Then, for the next 13 months while he was on 80 mg. Oxycontin and Dilaudid per day, his full body spasms decreased to an average of about nine per month. In September 2010, Dr. Gill started to decrease the dose of Oxycontin. The decreases continued until December 2011, when the plaintiff no longer used Oxycontin and relied on Dilaudid alone. The number of full body spasms during this 16-month period increased again to an average of 14 per month, and then 13 per month for the first four months of 2012\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "31  The real spike in the number of full body spasms appears from the charts to have started in May 2012 and continued to May 2013. Over this 13-month period, the plaintiff's full body spasms have increased in number to an average of 30 per month\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "32  In summary, for the first 10 months after the accident the plaintiff experienced more than double the average number per month of full body spasms and almost triple the average number of Demerol shots. However, this situation seemed to calm down for the next year while he was on the full dosage of Oxycontin. When Dr. Gill started to reduce the Oxycontin in September 2010, there was a corresponding gradual rise in full body spasms, but it was not until a year and a half later, in May 2012, that the full body spasms started to increase to a range of 30 per month.\n",
      "III. CAUSATIO\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "33  It appears that the plaintiff's medical condition has dramatically worsened over the last year. There was no medical explanation given by any of the expert witnesses for this unusual turn of events, other than the change in the plaintiff's medication\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "34  Dr. Gill wrote in his report of January 13, 2013, that:\n",
      "The increase in pain and opiate use is far greater than one would expect from natural variations in his condition. The increased frequency has been over years and not over a few weeks whereas natural variations occur over a relatively brief period and then return to the base line. For Mr. Chow the aggravation of symptoms is not only dramatic but has been sustained over several years. That evidence is clearly much more than one would ascribe to natural variations\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "35  Dr. Chu, the plaintiff's expert physiatrist, opines in his report of November 5, 2012, that he did not know what could have caused such a degree of pain flare-up. It was not due to any specific musculoskeletal or neurological cause. Dr. Chu found that it was difficult to draw a direct line from a possible injury suffered from the 2008 accident and the severe exacerbation of his chronic pain syndrome and frequency of pain flare-ups\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "36  Dr. Chu also notes that prior to the 2008 accident the plaintiff had a well-established chronic pain syndrome with a severe level of disability, and that today he still has a chronic pain syndrome with a severe level of disability. There was no significant musculoskeletal damage or injury as a result of the 2008 accident and yet the amount of pain or the frequency of flare-ups has increased and his level of disability is somewhat worse\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "37  On cross-examination, Dr. Gill agreed with Dr. Chu that it is difficult to draw a straight line between the accident and the exacerbation of the plaintiff's symptoms\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "38  Dr. Gill deferred to the opinions of Drs. Lau and Dimov of the St. Paul's Hospital Pain Clinic that the chronic pain was caused by neuropathic pain and muscular spasms with an underlying somatoform component\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "39  Somatoform disorders were explained by Dr. Levin, psychiatrist, in his report of July 2, 2012. These occur where the patient complains of physical symptoms which are excessive or for which there is no demonstrable organic basis. There is a tendency to experience emotional distress physically. Unlike factitious disorder, the production of symptoms in somatoform disorders is unconscious and unintentional; the person is not simulating or feigning illness, but believes fully that the illness is real. Dr. Levin agreed with Dr. Dimov that the plaintiff exhibited somatoform components in his presentation\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "40  Dr. Levin further opined in his report that the plaintiff's full body spasms were highly unusual and inconsistent with any psychiatric condition known to him. While Dr. Levin was not implying that the plaintiff was malingering, exaggerating or fabricating his symptoms, there was a significant volitional component in his presentation, to which opinion Dr. Gill agreed in cross-examination\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "41  Dr. Levin also opined that it was most likely that the plaintiff would have had periods of worsening of his abdominal pain and depression in the absence of the accident. This latter statement was based on Dr. Levin's review of the plaintiff's records dating back to 2002 and Dr. Levin's experience with chronic pain patients\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "42  The plaintiff relies on Dr. Gill's opinion that the 2008 accident aggravated the plaintiff's chronic pain syndrome. The defendants argue that Dr. Gill merely used a temporal basis as a means to determine causation. The British Columbia Court of Appeal in Madill v. Sithivong, , has warned that the court is called upon to exercise caution by exclusive or substantial reference to a temporal sequence of events to establish a fact by inference\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "43  The defendants also argue, as per Maslen v. Rubenstein  (C.A.), that the cause of the plaintiff's psychological injuries must lie in an unlawful act of the defendants, rather than the plaintiff's own choice\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "44  It may be that due to the overlapping nature of the plaintiff's soft tissue injuries and chronic pain syndrome, the plaintiff here is not able to establish that \"but for\" the defendant's negligence, the entirety of his injuries would not have occurred. It bears repeating that the vexing question of causation is not decided according to scientific precision, but according to common sense, to a large degree (Snell v. Farrell, ). It also bears repeating that the plaintiff need not prove that the defendant's breach of standard of care is the only cause of the plaintiff's injuries, only that it is \"a\" cause of them (Clements v. Clements, )\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "45  The causation picture here is far from clear, but when I weigh all of the evidence, in its totality, I find that the plaintiff has met the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, that the 2008 accident caused or materially contributed to an aggravation of his chronic pain syndrome\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "46  Similarly, the plaintiff cannot claim for any new injuries in the neck, shoulder or back areas, but I am satisfied that he has proved that the 2008 motor vehicle accident likely caused a flare-up of symptoms in these areas\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "47  Dr. Gill writes that the plaintiff also sustained injuries to his right shoulder from the accident. However, this was based on his comments that the plaintiff never complained to him of right shoulder pain before the accident of 2008. I prefer the opinions of Dr. Hawkins and Dr. Dreyer, orthopaedic surgeons, who opine that the plaintiff's shoulder issues are a result of calcium deposits and degenerative changes and are not part of the plaintiff's chronic pain syndrome, nor are they connected to the 2008 accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "48  I accept Dr. Hawkins' opinion, which was unchallenged, that the plaintiff's carpal tunnel syndrome was likely caused by the 2008 accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "49  The extent of aggravation of the plaintiff's condition is not necessarily reflected in the full increase of pain attacks. Absent the 2008 accident there was still a real and substantial possibility of increased spasms in the future, due to changes in his medication and the nature of chronic pain syndrome. These two latter considerations must be taken into account in the assessment of any damages awarded to the plaintiff for future damages\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "50  I have no doubt that the plaintiff suffered from a \"crumbling skull\" in that his pre-existing condition was manifest and disabling. Therefore, the defendants are only liable to the extent the accident caused an aggravation, or an acceleration of symptoms already apparent\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "51  The parties here have agreed that the damages incurred in the 2008 accident are divisible from the damages incurred in the 2002 accident. Therefore, the devaluation approach is an appropriate method to determine the amount of pain and suffering, loss of income, loss of function and need for care of the plaintiff, if any, that is attributable to the defendants and not the plaintiff's pre-existing condition.\n",

      "52  Prior to the 2008 accident, Dr. Gill had stated that the plaintiff was in constant pain with severe pain attacks three to four times per month, and would never be pain free. He remained permanently and totally disabled with severe restrictions on his physical ability. Dr. Gill was checking him every three or four months\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "53  Drs. O'Connor and Sable listed poor sleep, difficulties with concentration and memory, and erectile dysfunction as some of the plaintiff's complaints in 2006. These were echoed in reports of Drs. Gill and Griffin. Dr. Melouche recorded in June 2008, that the plaintiff's left hip and abdomen pain was \"pretty much unchanged\" since 2002\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",

He testified that after the 2008 accident he was unable to continue with office work and could only perform about 50 marriages per year, for an income of about $2,500 per annum from this source.

      "65  The cases of Steenblok v. Funk ; Palmer v. Goodall ; Kwei v. Boisclair ; and Perren v.

This is not a reasonable assumption in light of the evidence of prognosis. Dr. Chu reported that the plaintiff will return to pre-2008 accident status at some point. Dr. Gill testified that two years is probably too soon to expect recovery to his pre-2008 accident status, but perhaps five years is reasonable\n",

I accept Ms. Gibson's list of items which were submitted by the plaintiff as being reasonably expected to incur as a result of the plaintiff's decrease in function, but they must be restricted to a period of five years. When each of these items is paid for separately, it is much more expensive (almost double), than hiring one person to perform these jobs. Ms. Gibson's suggestion of using an agency person at a rate of $24 per hour at an annual cost of $22,276.80 ($21,216 plus 5% GST) is the most reasonable course of action\n",

      "32  In O'Leary v. Rupert, , Voith J. considered the issue of the defendant landlord's liability under the Act. He set out the relevant statutory provisions:\n",
      "[27] The OLA is also directly relevant. Section 1 of the OLA defines an \"occupier\" in the following terms:\n",
      "\"occupier\" means a person who\n",
      "is in physical possession of premises, or\n",
      "has responsibility for, and control over, the condition of premises, the activities conducted on those premises and the persons allowed to enter those premises,\n",
      "and, for this Act, there may be more than one occupier of the same premises;\n",
      "[28] Section 3 of the OLA sets out the duty of care of an occupier:\n",
      "3  (1) An occupier of premises owes a duty to take that care that in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that a person, and the person's property, on the premises, and property on the premises of a person, whether or not that person personally enters on the premises, will be reasonably safe in using the premises. \n",

      "6 (1) If premises are occupied or used under a tenancy under which a landlord is responsible for the maintenance or repair of the premises, it is the duty of the landlord to show toward any person who, or whose property, may be on the premises the same care in respect of risks arising from failure on the landlord's part in carrying out the landlord's responsibility, as is required by this Act to be shown by an occupier of premises toward persons entering on or using the premises.\n",
      "[30] Section 6(3) of the OLA further expands on the liability of a landlord and provides:\n",
      "For the purposes of this section\n",
      "a landlord is not in default of the landlord's duty under subsection (I) unless the default would be actionable at the suit of the occupier,\n",
      "nothing relieves a landlord of a duty the landlord may have apart from this section, and\n",

      "... That definition contains a number of requirements each of which must be satisfied conjunctively. It is not enough that some of them are satisfied, it must be all. For my purposes the section defines an occupier as,\n",

      "After all, the statutory duty on occupiers is framed quite generally as indeed it must be. That duty is to take reasonable care in the circumstances to make the premises safe. That duty does not change but the factors which are relevant to an assessment of what constitutes reasonable care will necessarily be very specific to each fact situation - thus the proviso \"such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable\".\n",

      "[215] In R. v. Creighton, , McLachlin J. (as she then was) held as follows at paras. 138-139:\n",
      "138 This is not to say that the question of guilt is determined in a factual vacuum. While the legal duty of the accused is not particularized by his or her personal characteristics short of incapacity, it is particularized in application by the nature of the activity and the circumstances surrounding the accused's failure to take the requisite care. As McIntyre J. pointed out in R. v. Tutton, , the answer to the question of whether the accused took reasonable care must be founded on a consideration of all the circumstances of the case. The question is what the reasonably prudent person would have done in all the circumstances ...\n",
      "139 The matter may be looked at in this way. The legal standard of care is always the same - what a reasonable person would have done in all the circumstances. The de facto or implied standard of care, however, may vary with the activity in question and the circumstances in the particular case. The law of civil negligence is helpful in understanding this distinction. In Salmond and Heuston on the Law of Torts (20th ed 1992), at pp. 227-28, the authors explain that the standard of care:\n",
      "will be different in different cases, for a reasonable person will not show the same anxious care when handling an umbrella as when handling a loaded gun. [Beckett v. Newalls Insulation Co. Ltd., [1953] 1 W.L.R. 8, at p. 17] ... But this is a different thing from recognising different legal standards of care; the test of negligence is the same in all cases. So a learner driver must comply with the same objective and impersonal standard as any other driver. [Nettleship v. Weston, [1971] 2 Q.B. 691] So also must a driver who is old or infirm, as distinct from totally unconscious. [Roberts v. Ramsbottom, [1980] 1 W.L.R. 823].\n",

Further, it is trite law that the precise nature of the harm that has unfolded need not be foreseen; only the reasonable possibility of harm and in a general way.

At best Billy and Mark are concurrent tortfeasors, not joint tortfeasors. Of course, the independent wrongful acts of separate persons may operate concurrently to cause the same damage. So, for example, Tekavec argued that Billy's defective repair was the cause of the injury. Certainly the defective repair was a cause of the injury. Although not argued, Tekavec could have asserted that Mark's failure to warn Jack was a cause of the accident. Arguably her failure to warn could be a cause of the injury\n",

The two situations are not analogous. Apportionment between tortious causes is expressly permitted by provincial negligence statutes and is consistent with the general principles of tort law. The plaintiff is still fully compensated and is placed in the position he or she would have been in but for the negligence of the defendants. Each defendant remains fully liable to the plaintiff for the injury, since each was a cause of the injury.

      "The Board's challenge concerns that portion of the damages that was, in the view of Vickers J., caused jointly by Mr. Hammer and the subsequent abusers. Vickers J. held Mr. Hammer liable for the sum total of these damages, stating that \"[a]s long as he [Mr. Hammer] is a part of the cause of the injury, even though his acts alone did not create the entire injury, his responsibility for the [entire] damage that flows from that injury is established\" (para. 57). As an authority for this proposition, Vickers J. cited Major J.'s claim in Athey, supra, at para. 17, that \"[a]s long as a defendant is part of the cause of an injury, the defendant is liable, even though his act alone was not enough to create the injury\" ...\n",
      "In the Board's submission, Vickers J. was incorrect in applying this principle to the case at bar. The principle applies, the Board claims, only where the other cause is non-tortious and is a precondition of the injury, not where it is tortious and occurs subsequently.\n",
      "In my view, the Board's reading of the principle articulated in Athey is overly narrow. After making the claim cited above, Major J. further expanded upon his reasoning, stating at para. 19 that:\n",

      "Stable disruption of the right SI joint; bilateral transverse process fractures of L4 and 5 vertebra; left transverse process fractures of the Li and L2 vertebra;\n",

      "Pelvic x-rays revealed slight malunion with the left hemi-pelvis being approximately 1 to 1.5 centimeters higher than the right; posterior screw is slightly bent in keeping with this shift in position; hip joints are normal on x-ray; lumbar spine x-rays show degenerative changes at L4-5 level and L5-S1 level\n",

      "66  With respect to Jack's prognosis, as it is now three years since the accident Jack's maximal level of recovery has likely been reached. The following observations inform the quantum of damages:\n",
      "Dr. Purnell does not anticipate any significant deterioration with regards to the orthopaedic injuries.\n",
      "Pelvic injury is healed and Dr. Purnell does not anticipate the need for further surgery.\n",
      "Approximately 60% of people with this type of injury will have permanent ongoing discomfort both in the regions of the sacrum and around the pubis.\n",
      "With this injury it is common for pain to be referred to the hip regions and Dr. Purnell thinks this is occurring in Mr. Jack's case.\n",
      "Jack will have permanent numbness on the outer aspect of his left thigh possibly as a result of injury to the lateral outaneous nerve of the thigh which is a common event with pelvic injuries and/or treatment.\n",
      "The numbness on the inner aspect of his knee he reports to be intermittent but is likely to continue. This is in the distribution of the L3 and L4 nerve roots probably due to mild nerve root impingement.\n",
      "Jack will have permanent intermittent low back pain with evidence of degenerative changes at L4 and L5-S1 levels.\n",
      "Dr. Purnell could find no specific reference to left foot injury and on assessment no specific objective findings to relate to a specific diagnosis.\n",
      "Dr. Purnell can only find documentation suggesting a left sided 9th and 10th rib fracture. The areas of tenderness is over his 11th and 12th ribs which are commonly referred to as floating ribs. Dr. Purnell is unsure why he remains specifically tender in these areas, although this is likely related to this injury.\n",
      "Complaints of bowel problems, incisional hernia problems, headaches and erectile dysfunction are outside Dr. Purnell's area of expertise and as such he was unable to make specific recommendations or a prognosis. The incisional hernia problems and headaches are likely results of the injuries.\n",
      "With regard to complaints of neck discomfort there is evidence of pre-existing degenerative changes at the C2 and 3 level. Dr. Purnell could find no documentation to suggest acute injury at the time of the Accident.\n",
      "Jack indicated he has a lot of mood changes over frustration at being unable to do things as well as he used to do them. Despite that, his health questionnaire results indicate that his emotional well being remains at a normal level within the confines of this type of assessment.\n",
      "Although Jack perceives he is markedly affected from a functional point of view as a result of his symptoms, he is managing to hold down a relatively physically demanding job working 84 hours a week. He acknowledges that financial means dictate he has to work. He is performing this work with a degree of discomfort.\n",
      "Jack's main recreational activities were hunting and fishing. These are now done with a degree of pain, and Mr. Jack cannot hunt in the manner he did previously. That is a significant negative consequence of the injuries\n",

      "67  Jack relies on George v. Middlemiss,  (S.C.), suggesting damages of $110,000. In George, Cashman J. described the consequences of the injuries thus:\n",
      "[71] The plaintiff is not the person she was or could expect to be before the motor vehicle accident. There is no real dispute that the plaintiff's injuries were very serious and long lasting. They were near fatal, and will have a significant impact on the plaintiff's life. She faces at least three more operations and possibly as many as five, depending upon the success of a hip replacement. Three of those operations are to remove hardware and screws alone.\n",
      "[72] The plaintiff cannot do many of the things she used to enjoy. Some things she can do to some extent, such as walking, but that is significantly restricted by the injuries suffered in this accident\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "68  Concerning the range for non-pecuniary loss, Cashman J. said as follows:\n",
      "[73] Both counsel have put forward cases in the $90,000 range. Because of the plaintiff's permanent injuries and possible disablement in the future, and with future surgical intervention a virtual certainty, the plaintiff says that the range here should be $150,000. Counsel for the plaintiff points to the similarities between this case and that in Wright v. Mason, , Vancouver Registry No. B893695, March 22, 1991, a decision of Lander, J. where he awarded that plaintiff $160,000 for non-pecuniary damages. Mr. Ridgway concedes that the injuries are very serious with the probable consequences and suggests a range of $90,000 to $110,000\n",
      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "69  The Court awarded $145,000 for non-pecuniary damages. I note that George is an older case, being decided in 1994. The injuries in George were, in my opinion, more severe. In George, Cashman J. relied on Wright v. Mason, a decision of Lander J. where he awarded that plaintiff $160,000 for non-pecuniary damages. Both George and Wright are older cases. While they awarded higher damages the injuries in those cases were more severe. Adjusted for time and severity, the cases support the quantum sought here\n",
      "======\n",

      "70  Macaulay J. considered George in Green v. Wilson,  (S.C.). He considered the injury patterns and ongoing pain to be reasonably comparable to that in George and Parypa v. Wickware,  (S.C.), and Yon v. Tardiff,  (S.C.), awarding $135,000\n",
      "======\n",

      "73  Evidence submitted by the employer estimated his before tax income loss to October 2007 at $43,000. He was unable to return to work until six months post-accident.

      "======\n",
      "\n",
      "76  In 2009 there was an economic downturn and less work available to Jack. There was also less work available to him because he had lost seniority with his employer because of his absence due to injury. Jack also testified that he lost some days because of soreness, where he was simply unable to work. The loss in 2009 from both sources is less, $15,000 gross, or $12,000 net\n",

      "Application by the plaintiff, by way of a summary trial, to determine the defendant's liability for damages he suffered in a motor vehicle accident. In February 2007, the plaintiff was struck by the defendant's vehicle while walking along the side of the road. There was little admissible evidence about the accident. The plaintiff had no memory of the accident as a result of his injuries. A passenger in the defendant's vehicle subsequently died and the defendant suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The defendant argued that he was not negligent. In the alternative, he argued the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. The defendant also argued that several answers provided during his examination for discovery, that were not read in by the plaintiff, should be read into the record. \n",

      " Statements made by the defendant during discovery that were reasonably connected to the questions read in by the plaintiff were to be read in. The evidence established that the defendant was exceeding the speed limit, in dark, foggy and misty conditions and was driving very close to the curb. The defendant's speed and proximity to the curb were the cause of the accident. This was supported by his own evidence that he did not see the plaintiff leave the curb. The plaintiff was contributorily negligent. He failed to take adequate precautions for visibility, failed to walk on the side of the road with a sidewalk, failed to walk facing traffic and failed to take reasonable care of his own safety by falling or stepping onto the roadway. Both parties were in breach of provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act. Where there was no reliable evidence to apportion the parties' negligence, the Negligence Act apportioned blame equally. This conclusion was supported by inferences that could be drawn from the circumstances of the case. It was also consistent with the fact that the duty placed on a motorist to take reasonable care to avoid a collision with a pedestrian was not greater than the duty on a pedestrian to take reasonable care when entering a roadway.\n",

      "Action by Ediger against a physician, Johnston, for damages for personal injuries suffered during her birth. Ediger was 11 years old, and Johnston was her mother's obstetrician and gynaecologist at the time of her birth. Late in the mother's labour, Johnston decided to attempt a rotational mid-level forceps procedure to assist the delivery. Johnston told the mother about the steps he would follow in attempting a forceps delivery, but he did not advise her of the risks associated with it or of possible alternatives. Johnston was not satisfied with the placement of the second forceps blade, and he decided to abandon the forceps attempt. At or around that time, Ediger's heart rate dropped to 50-60 beats per minute in what became a persistent bradycardia. At that low level, a fetal heart rate was expected to result in significant brain injury to the fetus. Every effort was then made to arrange for an emergency Caesarean section. However, on telephoning the anaesthetist, Dr. Boldt, Johnston learned that he was tied up in another emergency procedure. Johnston and the nurses telephoned to find another anaesthetist, eventually finding Dr. Lim. In the meantime, Dr. Boldt stabilized his patient and rushed up to anaesthetize the mother for her emergency Caesarean section. Ediger was born within two minutes of Dr. Boldt's arrival and approximately 18 minutes after Johnston had abandoned the forceps procedure. Ediger was very \"flat\" on her delivery and required resuscitation. She had suffered a catastrophic hypoxic (anoxic) ischemic brain injury from which followed sustained profound neurological compromise. The lack of blood flow and oxygen to her brain resulted in profound asphyxial injury. She was left with spastic quadriplegia and cerebral palsy. Ediger was non-verbal, tube-fed, confined to a wheelchair, and was totally dependent on others for all of her daily needs. Her life expectancy was 38 years. Ediger claimed that Johnston was negligent in attempting the mid-forceps procedure and that he should not have attempted the procedure except as a \"double set-up\" in the operating room, with an anaesthetist and nursing staff standing by at the ready to perform a Caesarean section surgery and delivery, if necessary. Ediger further alleged that Johnston proceeded with the mid-forceps procedure without her mother's informed consent. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed.\n",
      " Ediger was awarded non-pecuniary damages of $260,000, special damages of $40,000, damages for future care of $350,000 until the age of 19, and $650,000 after the age of 19, $950,000 for equipment, therapies and other services, $209,000 for accommodations and renovations, $175,000 for in-trust past and future services provided by the parents, and $590,000 for lost earning capacity. Johnston did not breach the standard of care in deciding to attempt a rotational mid-forceps delivery or in carrying it out without the support of a double set-up. However, the standard of care for mid-forceps procedures required anaesthetic support to be immediately available. Johnston breached the standard of care in proceeding with the attempt without first checking on the availability of back-up for a Caesarean section delivery, if necessary. Had he inquired, he would have learned that the on-call anaesthetist, Dr. Boldt, was fully occupied with a life-and-death situation, and was to remain so for some time, and Johnston could have postponed the mid-forceps procedure until back-up was more quickly available. Despite an interlude of between one and two minutes after the forceps attempt and before the onset of the bradycardia, the evidence established that the umbilical cord compression that caused the bradycardia would not have occurred without the forceps attempt. Because of Johnston's failure to ensure that surgical back-up was reasonably available, the damage was done before Ediger could be delivered by Caesarean section and resuscitated. Ediger's claim in negligence was proven. She also proved her claim based on the absence of her mother's informed consent to the forceps procedure. The mother was told what Johnston had determined to do, but she was not advised of the risks of the procedure or of alternatives to it. While the risks of fetal bradycardia and hypoxia were statistically small, the enormity of the potential consequences made the risks significant and thus material risks that Johnston should have disclosed to the mother before proceeding with the forceps attempt. Had she been properly informed, the mother likely would have chosen either to deliver by Caesarean section or to postpone the forceps attempt until an anaesthetist was available to provide reasonable back-up. Ediger was entitled to base a claim on the lack of her mother's informed consent to the procedure that harmed her while she was a fetus, as a physician's duty of care to a pregnant woman extended also to her fetus.\n",

      "Action by the plaintiff, Furness, against the defendants, Guest and TTL Enterprises, for damages to compensate for personal injuries. In February 2007, the plaintiff alleged that he was struck by the defendants' tractor truck while he attempted to cross the roadway at an intersection controlled by traffic lights. The plaintiff entered a pedestrian crosswalk while the \"don't walk\" signal flashed. At the time of the collision, the pedestrian signal had expired and a green arrow illuminated, permitting Guest to execute a left-turn. His vehicle's bumper struck the plaintiff's knee in the course of attempting the turn. The plaintiff claimed damages in the range of $60,000 to $80,000 for fractures and soft tissue injuries to his knee that caused ongoing pain and other ancillary injuries. He underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in June 2007. His recovery was complicated by a permanent partial shoulder disability and a pre-existing arthritic spinal condition. The plaintiff acknowledged a degree of contributory neglige nce, but submitted that the accident was predominantly caused by the Guest's negligence in failing to see him walking in the crosswalk. The defendants admitted that the plaintiff was struck by the truck, but contended that the accident was caused solely by the plaintiff's negligence in failing to obey the pedestrian traffic signal. The defendants submitted that the applicable range of damages did not exceed $40,000. They contended that the plaintiff failed to mitigate his damages by not following the recommended course of treatment. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed in part.\n",
      " A reasonably skilled truck driver exercising reasonable care for pedestrians would have seen the plaintiff before the collision. Guest failed to keep a proper look out, causing the accident. His omission was negligent and breached s. 181(a) of the Motor Vehicle Act (MVA). The plaintiff's entry into the crosswalk against the \"don't walk\" signal contravened s. 132(3)(a) of the MVA and constituted contributory negligence. It was not established that the plaintiff ran into the intersection or had any opportunity to yield the right-of-way to Guest, and thus his conduct did not breach s. 179(2) of the MVA. The plaintiff's failure to ensure he was seen by Guest increased his degree of fault. Liability was apportioned as to 25 per cent against Guest and 75 per cent against the plaintiff. The plaintiff had substantially recovered from his injuries by the time of trial. There was no medical opinion causally connecting his current complaints to the injuries suffered in the accident. His pre -existing conditions were not exacerbated by the accident, but nonetheless complicated his recovery. No failure to mitigate was proven. Based on the nature and extent of the plaintiff's injuries, he was awarded $40,000 for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life and $1,020 for special damages, subject to apportionment for liability.\n",

      "Action by Veronica Howell for injuries sustained in a hit-and-run accident on January 20, 2014. Howell was crossing the eastbound lanes of a street. She jaywalked between eastbound cars which had stopped for a red light at and intersection. Westbound traffic was also stopped for the red light. Howell had safely navigated the two lanes of stopped eastbound traffic, but as she started to cross the clear westbound lanes, she was struck by a black pickup truck which was travelling eastbound in the westbound lanes. To access the left turn lane, the driver of the pickup truck must have travelled, at least in part, the wrong way in the westbound lanes and over a yellow painted traffic island. The driver of the pickup truck did not stop after striking Howell. He drove up the dedicated left turn lane and then, instead of turning left, turned right in front of the two lanes of stopped eastbound traffic, pulled over for a moment, then sped off. Howell suffered serious life-altering injuries in the accident, including a skull fracture and traumatic brain injury. She now had chronic pain, or a Somatic Symptom Disorder, cognitive issues, and an aggravation of certain pre-existing conditions. Howell alleged that the truck which struck her was driving by Leon Machi. Machi denied that his truck struck Howell or that he was driving it. Howell sought non-pecuniary damages, special damages, damages for past loss of income, damages for loss of the capacity to earn income in the future, an award for the cost of future care, and her costs. Just before the commencement of the trial, Machi filed an assignment in bankruptcy. He was self-represented and only attended a few days of the trial. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed.\n",
      " The statutory stay of proceedings against Machi under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA) was lifted. The trustee and the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia did not object to the lifting of the stay and Howell would be materially prejudiced if the stay was not lifted. The BIA should not interfere with a plaintiff's right to access the proceeds of insurance policies which may be available to cover personal or property damages and would not, in any event, be available to satisfy creditors. Howell was permitted to amend her claim to seek punitive damages. The amendments merely permitted Howell to argue that Machi's alleged behaviour was worthy of the retribution, deterrence, or denunciation that punitive damages achieved. Machi's denial that he was the driver of the truck was unbelievable. Machi's license was suspended on the date of the accident. Machi drove up the westbound lanes and straddled the painted yellow island. He had an extra responsibility to proceed carefully and slowly and to watch out for pedestrians or other eastbound vehicles which might also try to get a jump on traffic and access the dedicated left turn lane. Instead, Machi was travelling at an excessive rate of speed. Howell was jaywalking when she was hit. It was dark at the time of the accident and she was wearing a burgundy jacket and a grey toque which made her less visible. Machi was 75 per cent liable for the accident and Howell was 25 per cent liable. Prior to the accident, Howell was being treated for depression, anxiety and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) without hyperactivity. Howell was a university student with a goal of becoming a librarian or working in publishing. Howell was unable to return to university after the accident and worked at jobs with modest wages. Howell did return to university in 2015 and completed two courses but only with accommodation from the university. The evidence supported the finding that, despite her challenges, Howell was a resilient young woman who had clear future plans and goals and was taking the steps necessary to achieve them. Howell had multi-faceted ongoing cognitive and executive dysfunction. She suffered from an organic brain injury and chronic musculoskeletal pain. She also suffered from severe sleep deprivation and the ongoing effects of depression, anxiety, ADD and post-traumatic stress disorder. Her injuries impacted almost every aspect of her life. Howell was entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount $275,000. It was probable Howell would have achieved her goal of obtaining a Master's degree in Library Science and gone on to work in her chosen field. Her loss of income earning capacity was assessed at $1,950,000. Howell's residual income earning capacity was assessed at $175,000. Her assessed loss of income earning capacity was $1,775,000. Howell was awarded the agreed sum of $14,000 for past income loss. It was left to the parties, and/ or their experts to determine the present value of the cost of future care items approved by the trial judge. Special damages were assessed at $14,781. Howell was awarded punitive damages against Machi of $100,000 based on his failure to stop and the fact that he was driving while his licence was suspended. Howell's damages were reduced by 25 per cent to account for her contributory negligence.\n",

      "Action by Morrow against Outerbridge for damages for medical malpractice. Morrow was a junior hockey player and was considered one of the best in his league. An NHL team drafted him in 2002. At age 19, Morrow received surgery for a shoulder injury from Outerbridge, the junior team's orthopaedic surgeon. Outerbridge inserted two screws in Morrow's shoulder during the surgery but failed to bury them in the bone. He lied in his post-surgery report, failing to note the screws were standing above the bone. Morrow did not recover as expected after the surgery and was in significant pain all the time. Outerbridge refused to admit anything went wrong with the surgery, even when the doctor for the NHL team showed him x-rays that made it clear the screws were sticking out. Morrow because depressed because he was not able to play hockey or do anything without pain. He was eventually cut from his junior team, because his play and attitude deteriorated, and never played hockey again. He was unsuccessful at college and while he worked for a while in the oil patch, could not continue this lifestyle because the work was too physically demanding. He had significant arthritis and limited movement in his shoulder. He was in constant pain. His family and friends noted how he had been a happy person before the surgery but was now completely different. He was diagnosed with depression. All but one expert testified Outerbridge performed the surgery negligently, resulting in the irreparable damage to Morrow's shoulder that ended his hockey career and completely changed his life. The one defence expert refused to say whether or not Outerbridge fell below the standard of care. The evidence about what Morrow could have earned as a professional hockey player was not definitive. Morrow was considered a hard worker but was significantly limited by his injury and pain in the type of work he could do. He did not have a college education so his employment prospects were further limited. A shoulder replacement operation was planned and it was suggested that at least two more shoulder replacements would be necessary during the course of Morrow's life. This was expected to reduce his pain by at least 50 percent. These surgeries involved the risk of infection and nerve damage and would require three to five months of recovery time and up to one year of physiotherapy. \n",

      "Action by Jason Parlby for damages for injuries suffered in an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) accident. Parlby was a passenger in an ATV driven by the defendant, Jamey Pelland. The ATV collided with an RCMP vehicle driven by the defendant, Constable Paul Starr. Constable Starr observed the ATV driving the wrong way down an exit ramp. He pursued the ATV. Rather than stopping, the ATV continued driving. The collision occurred when Constable Starr attempted to overtake the ATV. The ATV left the roadway and travelled down a steep embankment, ultimately coming to rest upside down. Parlby was ejected from the ATV and suffered severe and complex injuries, including brain contusions and multiple fractures. He was taken to hospital, where he underwent surgeries on his spine and left shoulder. Initially, Parlby could not move his legs but after intensive rehabilitation he was able to walk again. At the time of his discharge from rehabilitation, Parlby was diagnosed with an incomplete spinal cord injury along with several related conditions, including a neurogenic bowel and bladder, neuropathic pain, increased tone or spasticity in his legs, as well as a serious injury to the nerves or brachial plexus that innervated his left shoulder and arm. He underwent two further shoulder surgeries. At the time of the collision, Parlby was married with a small child. He was completing an apprenticeship in auto mechanics and working full time for an automotive business. In the fall of 2014, Parlby returned to the automotive business, working largely at the front counter. There was no dispute he was no longer capable of working as an auto mechanic. Parlby alleged the collision was caused by the negligence of both Pelland and Constable Starr. Constable Starr, the Attorney General of Canada and the Minister of Justice (police defendants) denied any liability for the collision. They claimed Pelland was driving while impaired and failed to stop when directed. Parlby's claim for damages included non-pecuniary damages, damages for past and future loss of earning capacity, the cost of future care, in trust damages and special damages. He took the position his injuries had significantly impaired his ability to function, and his condition would deteriorate further as he aged. The police defendants acknowledged that Parlby was injured in the collision, but argued his ongoing symptoms and limitations were more minor than he suggested and any risk of deterioration was not proven. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed.\n",
      " Constable Starr was not engaged in a pursuit either before or at the time he attempted to overtake the ATV. After stopping the police car and then deciding to get ahead of the ATV to warn oncoming traffic, he was engaged in an emergency response and operating an emergency vehicle that involved closing the distance on the ATV before attempting to overtake and pass it. However, Constable Starr's decision to overtake the ATV and block the intersection ahead to protect public safety was reasonable and necessitated by his duty to protect motorists, including the ATV occupants, from a possible collision. He failed to consider the vulnerability of the occupants or the risk of his intervention. Constable Starr failed to drive in a manner that would have allowed him to take evasive action and to pass at a safe distance given the reasonably foreseeable risk that the ATV might move into the oncoming lane. There was no dispute that Pelland's negligent conduct caused or contributed to the collision. The evidence failed to establish that the use of a seatbelt or helmet by Parlby would have prevented or lessened his injuries. The police defendants also failed to establish that Parlby ought to have known that Pelland was impaired. Liability for the accident was apportioned 65 per cent to Pelland and 35 per cent to Constable Starr. Parlby suffered a spinal injury in the accident which resulted in neurological deficits that affected his motor and sensory functioning, caused weakness, stiffness or increased tone and spasticity or spasm in his legs. He was predisposed to a deterioration in his physical condition, and therefore his functioning, as he aged. Parlby suffered significant permanent changes to his urologic system. His spinal cord injury resulted in sexual dysfunction and accompanying psychological symptoms including loss of sexual self-esteem, distress, frustration and self-doubt. He had a very limited range around his left shoulder. Parlby's pain was multifactorial and complex, and likely to worsen with age. His post-injury employment options were significantly limited. Parlby was awarded non-pecuniary damages of $290,000. He was awarded past pecuniary loss of the net amount that resulted from gross earnings of $67,650. The present value of Parlby's future earnings was properly estimated at $1.7 million. From that amount was deducted $434,859 for residual earning capacity. Parlby was awarded $1,265,141 for loss of future earning capacity. He was awarded $1,008,027 for the cost of future care, which included amounts for in-home supports, therapy, rehabilitation, transportation and home maintenance. Parlby's wife was awarded in-trust damages of $35,000. Special damages were estimated at $12,652.\n",

      "HELD: Action allowed.\n",
      " Minhas awarded $76,653 in damages. Minhas was an unreliable and dishonest witness. Any expert's opinions based on information provided by Minhas were likely to be unsupported and there were also serious concerns about the credibility of Minhas's lay witnesses. Minhas failed to prove that he suffered a brain injury as a result of the accident. Minhas had suffered soft tissue injuries to his neck, back and face, but the symptoms were not severe or debilitating. The fact that Minhas did not immediately purchase the anti-inflammatory medications and painkillers prescribed for him suggested that any discomfort was tolerable or easily alleviated. The accident did not cause a fracture of Minhas's jaw. However, there was a causal connection between the accident and Minhas's subsequent jaw surgery, as a chronic problem with Minhas's jaw was exacerbated. Minhas was entitled to compensation for the pain and discomfort of the surgery and also damages flowing from a respiratory infection developed as a result. Minhas was not entitled to recover any award for post-surgical problems with his jaw and/or teeth as these were caused by Minhas's decision to decline treatment. Given Minhas's family history of diabetes and the period of time that passed between the accident and the diagnosis, it was not persuasive that the diabetes was caused by the accident. Also, given inconsistencies in symptoms, dates of onset, the long passage of time, and Minhas's general lack of credibility, Minhas failed to prove that the reported dizziness, tinnitus, balance problem and minor hearing loss were caused by the accident. Minhas's mood and behaviour changes developed over time and coincided with an escalation in his consumption of alcohol and, possibly, prescription medication, and his frustration over the slow pace of litigation. The behavioural changes were not causally related to the motor vehicle accident or the surgery in a manner that was compensable. Minhas was partially disabled from the soft tissue injuries for a month or two after the accident and following the jaw surgery and the respiratory infection he was disabled from work for a further period of two to three months. Minhas was awarded $20,000 for loss of income or the capacity to earn income prior to the commencement of the trial. Minhas's capacity to earn income post-trial was not impaired and he would not suffer a loss of income in future. There was no award for damages for loss of the capacity to earn income post-trial. There was no basis for a trust award, as there was no evidence that family members lost employment income in order to care for Minhas. Special damages of $4,466 awarded. But for the accident, Minhas would not likely have had surgical treatment to address the jaw problems and was therefore entitled to compensation for the associated pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. An appropriate award for non-pecuniary losses was $70,000. Minhas contributed to his injuries by failing to wear his seat belt and the award would be reduced by 20 per cent for contributory negligence, resulting in an award of damages of $76,653.\n",

The defendants in the Glanville action argued that she was partially liable for the accident by making a left turn while Moberg was an immediate hazard in the oncoming lane.

Grant was contributorily negligent. He was aware, or ought to have been aware, that Moberg was intoxicated and chose to ride with him. Grant's own intoxication did not make him an involuntary passenger. Grant was not contributorily negligent as a result of not wearing the shoulder portion of his seatbelt as there was no evidence that Grant's injuries would have been reduced if he had done so. Moberg was responsible for a greater portion of the accident as he was both negligent and reckless. Under Negligent Act liability apportionment, Grant was held 30 per cent responsible for his injuries.\n",

      "Action by the plaintiff, Watkins, against the defendants, Dormuth and the provincial and federal Crown, for damages to compensate for personal injuries. In the early morning of March 2007, the plaintiff's vehicle was struck by a police vehicle in a t-bone collision. The plaintiff was en route to work. She was attempting a left turn at the time the police vehicle attempted to pass her on the left. The police vehicle was one of four deployed in emergency fashion to a particular location as a result of a bait car activation. The plaintiff recalled seeing two vehicles in front of her and turned to avoid the police activity ahead. The police officer testified that he passed on the left into oncoming traffic in accordance with his training, as the natural reaction of drivers was to pull over to the right upon seeing lights and hearing sirens. He testified that the collision was unavoidable once the plaintiff commenced her left turn. The plaintiff submitted that the police officer's negligence was the sole cause of the accident. The defendants submitted that the plaintiff ought to have seen the police emergency lights, heard the police siren and pulled over. The plaintiff, now age 32, continued to suffer from symptoms that included neck and shoulder tightness, mild back pain, and, in particular, distractibility and cognitive difficulties caused by a head injury. The symptoms related to the plaintiff's head injury continued to affect her daily life activities, precluded a return to her employment in a pulp mill and possible employment in the oil fields, limited her involvement in competitive women's soccer and other recreational pursuits, and adversely affected the continuation of her university studies. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed.\n",
      " The police officer did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the risk of harm to the public from exercising emergency vehicle privileges was less than the risk to the public should he not exercise those privileges. The bait car activation could be caused by the opening of a door or trunk and did not necessarily mean the target vehicle was being driven. Police policy recognized that a bait car activation was a non-emergency event. The plaintiff did not breach her duty to yield to an emergency vehicle. The defendants failed to establish the plaintiff ought to have perceived the police vehicle given the vehicle's brief approach time and the unnecessarily aggressive attempt to pass. The officer drove without due regard for safety. The police officer's negligence was the sole cause of the accident. The plaintiff suffered a mild traumatic brain injury in the accident in addition to neck and back injuries. The plaintiff's ongoing cognitive difficulties were due to her brain injury and affected her life significantly. The prognosis for the plaintiff's injuries was that there would be no further improvement. The plaintiff was awarded damages totaling $965,827 comprised of $175,000 for non-pecuniary loss, $238,500 for past loss of income, $525,000 for loss of future earning capacity, $10,750 for costs of future care, and $16,577 for special damages.\n",

      "Action by the plaintiff, Paur, by his Committee, against the defendants, Providence Health Care, Doctor Pickett, and three nurses, for damages for negligence. The plaintiff, age 36, was brought into the St. Paul's Hospital emergency room by police shortly after midnight. He had a history of substance abuse, bipolar disorder and prior suicide attempts. He was employed intermittently as a glass worker. The defendant physician certified the plaintiff under the Mental Health Act, as he had expressed suicidal thoughts and was intoxicated. The physician intended to hold the plaintiff overnight for assessment in the morning after he had sobered up. The plaintiff was kept in the Comox Unit, an area monitored by the three defendant nurses. While two nurses were on duty and one nurse was on a scheduled break, the plaintiff locked himself in the bathroom. He proceeded to open the ceiling tiles and hang himself using his hospital gown. After several minutes passed, a nurse investigated and was unable to open the locked door. Upon opening the door, the plaintiff was discovered hanging and unconscious. The attempted suicide caused a permanent brain injury. At issue was whether the hospital, the emergency room physician and the three nurses were negligent in failing to keep the plaintiff safe from self-harm. If negligence was established, further at issue was the appropriate quantum of damages. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed as against the hospital and two of the three nurses.\n",
      " The physician involved in the plaintiff's care was not negligent with respect to the assessment of the plaintiff and the instructions given to the nurses regarding his care. The hospital housed a large number of suicidal and intoxicated certified patients in the Comox Unit on an involuntary basis. The hospital knew or ought to have known of the foreseeable real risk of a suicidal intoxicated certified patient, such as the plaintiff, attempting suicide by hanging, and the risk of the associated injuries resulting within minutes. The hospital knew or ought to have known that the bathroom in the Comox Unit was unsafe for such a patient, as its ceiling was not ligature-proof. The hospital had no policies or protocols for nursing staff to protect against patients being unmonitored in a locked unsafe bathroom for a period of five minutes or more. The hospital did not exercise ordinary caution in the circumstances and breached its duty to keep the plaintiff safe, thereby causing his injuries. In addition, the two nurses on duty at the time of the hanging failed to meet the standard of care for observing the plaintiff and ensuring his safety. The plaintiff was left unmonitored in the bathroom for long enough to hang himself to the point of unconsciousness, causing catastrophic permanent injuries. The plaintiff's ability to support himself, live without daily supervision and intervention, and obtain basic necessities was permanently lost. Given the paramount objective of ensuring future care, a total lifestyle approach was used to assess damages. Based on the plaintiff's lifestyle and risk factors and using a starting point of 42.1 years, his life expectancy but for the injury was reduced by 17.95 years, and reduced by 9.2 years post-trial. The plaintiff was awarded non-pecuniary damages of $355,300 and special damages of $5,594. His mother was awarded an in-trust claim of $30,000. No damages were awarded for future loss of earning capacity based on opposing contingencies and the coverage of living expenses by the future care award. The parties were directed to discuss the past loss of earning capacity and costs of future care claims based on the court's findings, with further submissions if required.\n",

      "Action for damages for personal injuries sustained when the plaintiff was struck by a train at a level crossing. The defendant CPR was responsible for maintaining the crossing and the defendant CNR operated the train. The crossing did not have a gate and signals, but had signs warning not to stop on the tracks. There was a stop sign prior to the crossing, and then another stop sign after the crossing. Safety concerns were identified over the years and there had been other vehicles hit by trains. The plaintiff conceded she did not stop at the first stop sign, because she thought the tracks were abandoned. The plaintiff testified she could not imagine the tracks were being used when the crossing was so dangerous. The plaintiff sustained an incomplete spinal cord injury and a traumatic brain injury. The plaintiff now used a walker, had ongoing physical issues, fatigue, incontinence and sexual dysfunction, difficulty processing information, making decisions and responding appropriately and developed depression. The 49-year-old plaintiff was highly-educated and was working as a project scheduler earning a base salary of $85,000 at the time of the accident. The plaintiff had not returned to work and the defendants accepted she was no longer competitively employable. The defendants argued that the plaintiff was liable for the accident for her failure to stop at the first stop sign and that if they were liable, the province and city were liable for failing to proceed with a plan to upgrade the crossing, and the plaintiff's employer was liable because the blackberry bushes grew on its property. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed in part.\n",
      " The space between the railway tracks and second stop sign was shorter than the length of regular vehicles and, given the lack of storage space and automated signals, vehicles stopped at the second stop sign were at risk of being struck by a train. CPR was aware of the risk and accepted a safety upgrade was needed, but upgrading the crossing was not feasible when the province and municipality withdrew their support. The bushes growing on the plaintiff's employer's property encroached on the right of way and blocked sightlines at the crossing. The industry standard set out a 10-second warning in the G4-A guidelines, which CPR adopted, but ensuring the sightline was not actually a priority during inspections. Following the accident, CPR cutback and then removed the bushes with relative ease. The plaintiff violated the Motor Vehicle Act in failing to stop at the first stop sign. The CNR train conductor was not in a position to assess the sightline when operating the train, properly sounded the horn, and was not liable. CPR was not liable for failing to upgrade the crossing, so there was no liability on the part of the province or municipality. CPR never expressed concerns to the employer about the bushes so the employer was not liable. The plaintiff's negligence came from an honest but unreasonable belief the tracks were abandoned while CPR's negligence in failing to maintain the sightlines or issue a slow order came from indifference. Liability was apportioned 40 per cent to the plaintiff and 60 per cent to CPR. The spinal cord injury reduced the plaintiff's life expectancy by approximately eight years. The plaintiff's injuries were profound and devastating and she faced the risk of further deterioration with age. She was awarded $330,000 non-pecuniary damages. The plaintiff was awarded $216,586 past income loss. The plaintiff was qualified, motivated and hardworking and would have chosen to remain in the workforce past the regular retirement age. She was awarded $1,166,282 loss of earning capacity. The plaintiff's sister went above and beyond what was expected of a sibling in caring for the plaintiff. She was awarded $50,000 in trust. The plaintiff was awarded $133,898 for the Ministry of Health claim, $133,021 for the subrogated insurance claim, and special damages of $18,000. For cost of future care, the plaintiff was awarded $2,500 for vocational needs, $90,000 for home modifications, a home care award to be calculated, $15,000 for medical/rehabilitation, $2,000 for sexual medicine services, $5,910 for psychological support, $50,055 for occupational therapy, $13,000 for massage therapy, $73,662 for a kinesiologist, $23,071 for physiotherapy and $48,000 for medications.\n",

      "Action for damages for personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. The accident happened in August 2006. The plaintiff pedestrian was struck by defendant's car while he was crossing the street using a cross-walk. The defendant admitted negligence, but argued the plaintiff was contributorily negligent because he failed to look out for his safety and that liability should be assessed equally. The plaintiff claimed that he suffered from ongoing neck and back pain following the accident which impacted his pursuit of recreational activities such as golf and skiing. The plaintiff was a property developer. He suffered no loss of income in the six years following the accident, but argued it would cause him to retire early and claimed a large sum to compensate for loss of earning capacity. The plaintiff claimed past and future loss of work capacity, recovery of costs for therapies, future cost of physiotherapy and ergonomic office equipment and past and future cost of yard work.

      " The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent. He was in the cross-walk before defendant's car went into motion and was entitled to assume the defendant would see him before moving and give way to him. The accident caused the plaintiff's pre-existing, but asymptomatic, neck condition to become symptomatic and permanent. It also accelerated and worsened his pre-existing back condition. After discounting the award on the basis of the plaintiff's pre-existing condition, he was awarded $75,000 for pain and suffering and reduced enjoyment of recreational activities. The pre-trial loss of yard maintenance was valued at $20,000 and the plaintiff's loss of past capacity to perform yard work was valued at $38,700. The plaintiff's capacity to drive business forward was negatively impacted by the long-term effects of the accident. While the value of the loss was difficult to assess, the plaintiff was awarded $300,000 which was comparable to the loss of one year's income. The claims for ergonomic office furniture and golf therapy were dismissed because the plaintiff failed to follow advice to pursue these measures despite being financially capable of doing so. The cost of future care for monthly massage treatments necessary to manage the plaintiff's pain were valued at $11,500. After factoring in the plaintiff age, the loss of future yard maintenance was valued at $32,500 which would compensate the plaintiff for the costs until age 70.\n",

      "Action by a motorist for damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. In December 2008, the parties' vehicles collided in an intersection as the defendant attempted to make a left turn. The plaintiff claimed that when she was close to the intersection, the light turned from green to yellow and she proceeded through. The defendant claimed that he moved into the intersection to make a left-turn and that the plaintiff had entered into the intersection on a late yellow or red light and had veered towards him. Following the accident, the plaintiff experienced pain in her back, neck and head and a numb body. Her pain had continued since the accident and her condition had deteriorated. She currently used a wheelchair for mobility outside her home. The plaintiff was a 67-year-old immigrant from Peru. She was unmarried with three adult children. Until 2008, she had been providing care to special needs children who were living in her home. She operated a home-based massage business from September 2008 until late 2009 or early 2010. The plaintiff had been injured in to previous motor vehicle accidents. Prior to the accident, she was diagnosed with depression, chronic pain, low back pain, hearing loss, vision loss and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Despite her various complaints, she was physically and socially active. The plaintiff sought non-pecuniary damages, past income loss, future income loss, special damages and costs of future care. The defendant denied liability for the accident and took issue with the quantum of damages claimed. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed.\n",
      " Neither party kept a proper lookout and both drove imprudently into the path of the other. The plaintiff was a hazard when the defendant began his turn and thus the defendant was the servient driver and was obliged to surrender the right-of-way. As the defendant bore substantially greater responsibility for the collision, negligence was attributed to him at 80 per cent. The plaintiff appeared to have injuries caused by a number of factors, including the impact of the collision. The plaintiff's pre-existing degenerative disc disease, although substantially asymptomatic, was inherent in her original position. The degenerative changes to the plaintiff's spine were progressive likely would have detrimentally affected her in the future even without the accident. As a result of the accident, the plaintiff suffered minor low back, neck and upper back symptoms from a whiplash type injury. As a result of the accident, the plaintiff re-activated her pre-existing psychological condition, which manifested in chronic pain, as well as depression and psychosis. There were a number of treatments that, when pursued by the plaintiff, were likely to improve her condition. Given that the plaintiff's pre-existing conditions might have become symptomatic without the accident, the award for non-pecuniary damages was reduced by 10 per cent to account for that contingency, with the result that her damages were assessed at $180,000. The plaintiff's ability to earn income after the accident could reasonably have been compromised by her previous health issues and pain. Her past loss of income was assessed at $60,000 less required deductions. The evidence concerning the plaintiff's massage business was inadequate to perform a mathematical calculation of her income before or after the accident. Taking into account the uncertainties of the plaintiff's business prospects before the accident, her income earning capacity from the start of trial forward was minimal. Given her pre-accident health, her employment and business history, $35,000 was adequate for future loss of income. In addition, the plaintiff was entitled to $90,000 for costs of future care and $6,000 in special damages. Given the care that the plaintiff's daughters had provided to her, the plaintiff was award $15,000 in trust for each of her daughters. Given the previous finding on liability, the plaintiff was entitled to 80 per cent of the damages.\n",

      "Action by the plaintiff, Robinson, against the defendants, Leelund and Laine Turner, for damages for personal injuries. A bachelor party was held to celebrate Leelund Turner's upcoming wedding. The group spent an evening in a bar. Leelund was dressed exotically and carried a 32-pound metal ball with a two-foot chain. The ball and chain was supplied by Leelund's brother, Laine. Laine spent his time at the bar apart from the group, consuming non-alcoholic drinks. The plaintiff spent the evening at the same bar drinking with a group of friends. After leaving the bar, the ball and chain was affixed to Leelund's ankle. The brothers encountered the plaintiff, age 19. The plaintiff teased Leelund about his clothes and upcoming nuptials. Laine walked away in an effort to get the group moving. In the meantime, the teasing escalated into an altercation in which Leelund pushed the plaintiff. The plaintiff fell backwards, struck his head on the pavement, was knocked unconscious, and remained in a coma for several days. He suffered a serious traumatic brain injury. The plaintiff sued both Turner brothers, seeking general damages, past wage loss, loss of earning capacity, costs of future care, and an in-trust claim on behalf of his parents. Laine denied that he owed the plaintiff a duty of care to protect him from his brother. Leelund testified that he pushed the plaintiff to remove him from his personal space in a non-excessive manner. He submitted that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent for his injuries. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed as against Leelund.\n",
      " Laine brought the ball and chain to the party and permitted it to be attached to the leg of his intoxicated brother who in turn injured the plaintiff. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff and Laine were not in a sufficiently close or proximate relationship to justify imposition of a prima facie duty of care. Had a duty of care been found, no breach of the standard of care occurred by attaching the ball and chain after leaving the bar, or walking away from the impending confrontation. With respect to the liability of Leelund, his bachelor party apparel was an invitation for derision, but was not an invitation for harassment at close quarters. Leelund owed a duty of care to use reasonable force in his interactions with the plaintiff. The push was abrupt, careless and excessive, and it contributed to the plaintiff's injury. Leelund did not act in self-defence. The doctrine of volenti non fit injuria had no application. However, the plaintiff was contributorily negligent and also provoked the push through his persistent confrontational conduct while intoxicated. Leelund's responsibility for the damages incurred by the plaintiff was reduced by 30 per cent. At the time of trial, the plaintiff, age 24, had made a significant recovery, but nonetheless continued to exhibit cognitive and neurological deficits that caused ongoing permanent disabilities, including mental health challenges that required medication. The injuries had a profound impact on the plaintiff's life, and on his training to become an arborist. Subject to the reduction for contributory negligence and provocation, the plaintiff was awarded $250,000 for general damages, $40,000 for past wage loss, $350,000 for loss of earning capacity, $40,000 for the in-trust claim, and $110,000 for costs of future care.\n",

      " There was no evidence to support the claim that the catheterization was not a medically-indicated procedure, that the re-catheterization was without consent or that the nursing care during the deceased's first hospital visit fell below the standard of care. There was no reliable or cogent evidence to support the claims of negligence or battery against the hospital and nursing staff arising from the deceased's first admission. There was no evidence any delay in triage caused or contributed to the deceased's death. The evidence did not establish the deceased was inadequately monitored by the nursing staff or that they administered incorrect doses of medication. The plaintiff had failed to prove her claims against the nursing staff regarding the second hospital visit. There was no legal basis to bring the nervous shock claim given the underlying claims had not been made out. There was no basis to maintain the claims against the two doctors who were not actively involved in the deceased's care. There was no cogent evidence to support the negligence claim against the doctors involved in the resuscitation efforts. The battery claim against the doctors arising from the failed resuscitation effort was the sole claim to proceed to trial given conflicts in the evidence as to whether the deceased continued to be \"full code\" during the resuscitation.\n",

      "Action by seven plaintiffs against the defendant Plint for damages for sexual abuse and against the defendants, the United Church and the federal Crown, for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of statutory duty. The United Church and the Crown operated residential schools for Indian children. The plaintiffs attended one of the schools They claimed they were frequently sexually abused by Plint, who was the dormitory supervisor. The abuse occurred between 1940 and 1970. Plint raped students and forced them to do fellatio. The plaintiffs were in constant terror of Plint. It was unclear from the evidence if the abuse was reported to Plint's superior. A physician who attended at the school on a daily basis was unaware of any abuse. People in the community where the school was located were also unaware of any abuse. During this period, when an employee was hired, background checks were not conducted. People were not aware of the possibility of sexual abuse. The school was regularly inspected by agents of the Crown. Inspection reports indicated that the school provided a reasonably safe environment for the children. In addition to their claim in negligence, the plaintiffs claimed that the Church and the Crown breached their fiduciary duties in a variety of ways as follows. They removed them from their families and communities. They deprived them of family love and guidance, community support and the knowledge of their language and culture of their nation. They further breached their duty when they placed them in an environment where they were subjected to racial epithets, physical abuse and intolerable living conditions. The Church and the Crown were previously found vicariously liable for Plint's assaults. They claimed that the action was barred by the Limitation Act. No limitation period applied to a cause of action based on sexual misconduct. However, the plaintiffs also advanced claims that went beyond this category. This action was commenced in 1996. The latest date such claims could have been filed was 1993. The plaintiffs did not act for a postponement. They provided no evidence to explain their delay. The Church and the Crown claimed to be entitled to indemnification from each other. The Crown agreed to indemnify the Church for any loss the Church or its employees incurred through their operation of government-owned institutions. The Crown refused to provide a broader, general indemnity. The Crown submitted that more fault had to be apportioned to the Church since it managed the school. However, the Crown decided who was employed as the principal. It also had extensive supervisory authority over the school. The Crown had statutory authority over the children pursuant to the Indian Act. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed in part.\n",
      " Six of the plaintiffs were awarded damages against the Church and the Crown in varying amounts of non-pecuniary and aggravated damages based on vicarious liability. Awards were made to some of the plaintiffs for future counselling costs. The claims based on negligence and breach of fiduciary duty were dismissed. The claim against the Crown based on breach of statutory duty were allowed. Punitive damages were only awarded against Plint. The abuse occurred in secret. Six of the plaintiffs were sexually abused. There was insufficient evidence regarding the seventh plaintiff. Reliable evidence existed that raised serious doubts about the validity of this plaintiff's testimony. Her evidence contained inconsistencies. She also forgot traumatic events that were not easily forgotten. The Church and the Crown owed a duty of care to ensure that children, who had to attend the school, were not subjected to the depredations of sexual predators who worked there. The standard of care had to be assessed in the context of the time period of the abuse. A reasonable adult, who was associated with the school, was not aware of a systemic problem that required further investigation. Consequently, the Church and the Crown did not know, or could not have known, that the plaintiffs were abused. The plaintiffs failed to prove that the school's hiring and supervision standards fell short of reasonable standards that applied at that time. The Church and the Crown also fulfilled their obligation to provide a reasonably safe environment according to the standards of the time. The Church and the Crown did not breach their fiduciary obligations to the plaintiffs. They did not engage in dishonest conduct. Their conduct was not perpetrated for personal advantage in a relationship of trust and confidence. The Crown was the guardian of the plaintiffs under the Indian Act. It owed a duty of special diligence to them. It also exercised virtual absolute control over the lives of Indian people. The Crown failed to discharge its statutory obligations to the plaintiffs. With the exception of the claims for sexual misconduct, the plaintiffs' claims were barred by the Limitation Act. The Church was only entitled to a limited indemnity from the Crown. The Church and the Crown operated the school as a joint enterprise for their own purpose and gain. No right of indemnity existed. Liability was apportioned 75 per cent to the Crown and 25 per cent to the Church. The Crown was the more senior of the two partners. The measure of the plaintiffs' damages was the difference between the position they would have been in, absent the sexual abuse, and the position they occupied because of the abuse. The plaintiffs suffered damages from their compulsory placement in the school. The Church and the Crown were not liable for punitive damages. Punitive damages were not awarded against an employer for employee misconduct in the absence of reprehensible conduct by the employer.\n",

      "Action by the passenger, for injuries sustained on the defendant's bus. The 76-year-old plaintiff testified he stood before his stop, rang the bell and was holding the pole, but the bus stopped suddenly and he struck his head on the pole and then fell to the floor, striking his knees. The plaintiff testified his glasses were dislodged and dental work broken. The plaintiff testified no one tried to help, he did not alert the driver. The plaintiff's friend testified the bus stopped suddenly and she noticed the plaintiff on the floor, though she did not see him fall or hit the pole, and did not recall whether he was wearing glasses or if his dentures came out. The plaintiff claimed he sustained soft tissue injuries to his neck and back, contusions to his right chest and rib cage, strains to both hands, injury to the right side of his head, TMJ, dental injuries, and contusions to both knees, including a post-traumatic cyst that required surgical removal. The three busses on the route at the time identified by the plaintiff denied any incident occurred on their busses. The defendant testified abrupt stops could injure passengers and were to be avoided, and drivers were trained as such. The defendant argued the plaintiff's evidence was unreliable due to pre-existing cognitive impairments, and alcohol consumption. The friend had testified the plaintiff had alcohol on his breath. The plaintiff's family doctor testified the plaintiff had memory problems prior to the accident, cognitive impairment from a stroke, head injury from an assault and came to appointments with alcohol on his breath. However, he denied the plaintiff showed signs of alcohol abuse or that he was completely unreliable. At trial, the plaintiff had no recall of the prior assault or attending examination for discovery. The defendant argued the plaintiff did not prove he was injured on a bus, or that the defendant was negligent, or the plaintiff failed to take adequate care, or his injuries were minor. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed in part.\n",
      " The plaintiff's evidence was approached with caution, but he was able to describe the events of the day in detail, much of which was corroborated by his friend. The plaintiff's doctor gave measured and matter-of-fact evidence, had observed the plaintiff for years, and it was accepted that the plaintiff's memory problems fluctuated and he could provide reliable information. It was accepted that the plaintiff fell onto his knees as a result of the bus abruptly stopping. There was no evidence the driver stopped to avoid a hazard. The driver failed to decelerate smoothly as trained to do, and this was negligent. The driver was not identified, but the defendant was the only carrier on the route, and the drivers were its employees, so it was vicariously liable. The claim against the insurance corporation was thus dismissed. It was not unreasonable for the plaintiff to stand near the exit in anticipation of his stop, and he was holding the pole. While the plaintiff likely consumed alcohol, there was no evidence his consumption contributed to his fall. The plaintiff had pre-existing ankle and knee pain, a head injury, back, neck, hand and shoulder pain. The medical evidence established the plaintiff sustained soft tissue injuries to his neck and back, chest and rib cage contusions, and hand strain, which aggravated pre-existing conditions, but settled within five months. The fall caused contusions to the plaintiff's knees, which aggravated pre-existing knee pain and caused a cyst to form, which required surgical intervention, continued to cause pain and mobility problems and would likely require further surgery. The plaintiff failed to establish face, head, dental injuries or TMJ from the accident. The prognosis for the plaintiff's knee injury was uncertain, and his limited mobility affected his social life and activity. The plaintiff had pain and reduced functioning prior to the accident, but the accident caused impairment. The plaintiff was awarded $40,000 non-pecuniary loss. Future care for dental work was not compensable, but the plaintiff was awarded $500 for medication and transportation for knee surgery. The plaintiff was awarded $521 for special damages for physiotherapy and medications. He did not prove he lost his glasses in the accident.\n",

      "Application by Joinson for personal injury resulting from medical negligence. Within a one-year period, the plaintiff underwent three lower back surgeries. The plaintiff stated that he consented to the first surgery, did not validly consent to the second, and consented to the third. During the first surgery, the operating surgeon, instead of performing the surgery on the left side of L5-S, performed the surgery at the left side of L4-5. The surgeon admitted that he had been negligent in this operation. After the mistargeted first surgery, a second surgery was performed, which the plaintiff states he did not give valid informed consent for as he had not been fully informed of the surgery risks. The plaintiff stated that he should have been offered a bilateral discectomy, instead of a unilateral procedure. As a result, the plaintiff claimed that the second surgery worsened his pain and radicular symptoms, raising the prospect of him requiring a third surgery. The central question to be determined was the nature and extent of the plaintiff's pre-existing underlying degenerative process at L5-S1; and whether, had the plaintiff not undergone his unnecessary second surgery, it would have played the major prospective part in the production of his L5-S1 symptoms and resulting disability. Significantly, over time, the plaintiff's urinary symptoms also worsened. The plaintiff alleged a neurogenic bladder, which he said resulted from the first surgery; and/or to the second surgery; and/or to the combined effect of all three surgeries. The plaintiff sought compensation for pain, suffering, loss of income, loss of earning capacity, cost of future care and special damages, with respect to the first and second surgery. \n",

      "Action by Mair (formerly Leon) against the physician, Tu, for damages for medical negligence. On October 28, 2004, Mair, a 17-year-old labourer at a window manufacturing company and part-time university student, attended at the Chilliwack General Hospital emergency department for suturing of a laceration he had sustained at work. The hand injury occurred at about 1:40 p.m., when Mair was working with a chisel. He cut the posterior of his left thumb and the left middle finger at the knuckle. The company's first aid attendant treated the wounds with saline solution, applied a bandage to the thumb, closed up the finger wound with a butterfly bandage and wrapped it with gauze and tape. The company receptionist drove Mair to the hospital. He arrived there at about 2:00 p.m. After being triaged, Mair was seen by Tu at about 3:40 p.m. Tu applied freezing to Mair's finger by injecting anaesthetic and then led him into the Treatment Room, where there was a sink with a high pressure water supply. Tu turned on the cold water faucet and instructed Mair to hold his hand under the stream of water. Tu intended this to aid in the cleansing of the wound prior to suturing. He then left Mair unattended in the Treatment Room. While Tu was absent, Mair fainted, striking his head on the floor. A bystander informed a nurse that Mair had fainted and he was found on the floor. He was pale and sweaty. He was put on a gurney, and taken to the acute care area. Mair complained of headache. Tu assessed him and he sutured the finger. Because of the possibility that Mair had sustained a head injury, Tu decided to keep him under observation for a few hours. At 6:40 p.m., Mair vomited. He complained of pain in the back of his head, and he drifted off to sleep quickly. Tu suspected Mair had suffered a brain injury, and a CT scan of the head showed evidence of a basal skull fracture and a contrecoup-type injury in the frontal lobes. Mair was transported to Royal Columbian Hospital by ambulance for a neurological consultation. No neurological intervention was deemed necessary, and he was returned to Chilliwack General Hospital and admitted. He was observed overnight and discharged in the morning. A follow-up MRI investigation in November 2004 showed three areas of hemorrhagic contusion and/or scarring in the frontal lobes, and at least thirty additional areas of hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury in the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. At issue was Tu's liability for Mair's brain injury, and the severity of the resulting disability. \n",

      "Action by Zawadzki for damages. On September 17, 2004 Zawadzki was struck from behind, while crossing a street, by a U-Haul truck that was driven by the defendant Calimoso. Calimoso only admitted liability at the beginning of closing submissions and it was subject to Zawadzki's potential contributory negligence. At the time of the accident Zawadzki worked as an automotive technician and he crossed the street, after he looked both ways, to retrieve a vehicle that he was to work upon. Zawadzki was currently 44 years' old. In addition to being a skilled technician he was a very able musician who played drums. He was also very active and was involved in sporting and camping activities. Zawadzki claimed that he suffered lower back pain as a result of the accident. After the accident he drank alcohol excessively. He did not have a drinking problem before the accident. Zawadzki attempted a graduated return to work but such was unsuccessful. He was unable to return to his occupation or even to lighter duties associat ed with that work. He also did not return to his music. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed.\n",
      " Zawadzki was not contributorily negligent when he crossed the street. He took reasonable care for his safety and he acted as a person of ordinary prudence would do. Zawadzki was a steady and reliable worker prior to the accident. He was a well balanced and positive person. Zawadzki had no reported ongoing health issues. He suffered a serious injury to his right elbow as a result of the accident. He required three surgical procedures to deal with the injury and he struggled with chronic pain. Regarding the back pain Zawadzki periodically had some lower back discomfort but he had no real history of back pain in the six or seven year period that preceded the accident. His lower back problems from earlier accidents were resolved. However, almost a year after the accident his back pain resurfaced in a very significant and enduring way. The Court therefore concluded that the back pain was caused by the accident. His ongoing sleep problems were caused by the accident but his headaches did not r esult from them. The accident fundamentally changed Zawadzki's ability to partake in the various activities that gave him pleasure. It also affected his level of social activity. Zawadzki suffered from very significant mood disorders as a result of the accident. The changes were manifested as anger, anxiety and depression. Zawadzki's alcohol abuse was caused by the accident and it was reasonably foreseeable. Zawadzki suffered from various cognitive difficulties that were not caused by his head injury. The prognosis for those cognitive difficulties was very uncertain. As a result of the accident Zawadzki lacked the ability to continue to work as an automotive technician. Zawadzki failed to properly mitigate his damages. Non-pecuniary damages were assessed at $180,000. That award was reduced by 20 per cent to a $144,000 because of Zawadzki's failure to mitigate. Zawadzki could have worked as a service writer for his employer. A service writer dealt with customers, identified problems with their vehicles and th en he generated a computer service order. He was required to pursue this line of work, despite his disinterest in it. Past wage loss was determined to be $246,625, and due to his failure to mitigate, it was reduced to $206,312. Based on the fact that Zawadzki would retire at the age of 60 his future wage loss was determined to be $400,000. This was reduced by 20 per cent, to $320,000, to reflect his failure to mitigate. Future care costs were determined to be $130,690. Special damages were assessed at $18,035, which made the total award $819,037.\n",

      "Application by the defendant Crown for a determination of questions of law based on its defences to the action by the plaintiffs, K&L Land Partnership and related entities. Application by the plaintiffs for a determination that the Crown owed them a duty of care. In 2005, the plaintiffs purchased lands for development purposes from the third party, Armstrong. In 2007, the plaintiffs learned that the Crown, through the Department of National Defence, had historically used the lands for military training purposes and that unexploded munitions possibly remained on the lands. The last death caused by unexploded munitions on the lands occurred in 1973. The Crown sent information to the plaintiffs in 2007 and 2011 regarding the risk and its intent to conduct a risk assessment on the lands. The plaintiffs instead abandoned their development plans. The plaintiffs sued the Crown for economic damages caused by a failure to warn. Additional claims were raised in trespass and nuisance. The Crown raised limitation and statutory authority defences and sought a pre-trial determination. The plaintiffs sought a summary trial determination of the duty of care issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Applications dismissed.\n",
      " The plaintiffs' claims were not barred by the ultimate limitation period in the Limitations Act. Any duty to warn arose from the Crown's knowledge of the danger rather than the conduct that created the danger. The alleged loss caused by any breach of the duty to warn occurred when the plaintiffs purchased the lands in 2005. The claims based in trespass and nuisance were not barred by the ultimate limitation period due to the continuing nature of the claims. The plaintiffs' claims were not barred by the six-month limitation period in s. 269(1) of the National Defence Act, as the plaintiffs did not rely on any breach of duty by any person exercising a statutory duty or authority under the Act or its regulations. Neither s. 24 of the 1953 Crown Liability Act, nor s. 13 of the current Crown Liability and Proceeding Act barred the plaintiffs' claims, as the claims involved causes of action that arose subsequent to 1953, and the Crown had physical control of the lands on several occasions thereafter. The defence of statutory authority in s. 8 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act was unavailable, as there was nothing that provided authority for the Crown to leave unexploded munitions on tracts of land for an indeterminate period of time. Nor was there anything to support a conclusion that the alleged nuisance was the inevitable result of the exercise of statutory authority. The issue of whether the Crown owed the plaintiffs a duty of care was not suitable for summary disposition. It was not established that resolution of the issue would create efficiencies, as the issue of liability would required a trial in any event.\n",

      "Action by Heuring for damages arising from injuries as a result of a motor vehicle accident that happened while Heuring was cycling in October 2011. Smith, the defendant, denied liability on the basis he had not breached the requisite standard of care. Smith submitted Heuring had not followed traffic rules, including disobeying a stop sign, illegally riding across an intersection and veering into the crosswalk, where Smith's vehicle came into contact with Heuring. Heuring stated he had stopped approximately 10 feet back from the stop sign or stop line before entering the intersection, and that he had ridden his bike through the crosswalk without dismounting. Smith stated he was proceeding slowly and carefully through the intersection, but had not looked around a pillar \"blind spot\" in his vehicle to observe Heuring. Heuring, 59 at the time of the accident, was employed as a steamfitter in a hospital and also took separate union jobs. Heuring returned to work full-time in February 2012, but had some residual limitations and was unable to take an available union job. He testified he had intended to retire from the hospital in the summer of 2012 to focus solely on union work, but that changed after the accident. Heuring argued that prior to the accident he did not suffer from any ongoing physical complaints, but now had pain in his low back, hips and right knee. He claimed his ability to partake in recreational activities and household chores was now limited. Alternatively, Smith argued Heuring should be held 75 per cent at fault for the accident. Heuring submitted liability should be apportioned in the range of 5-15 per cent against him. Heuring claimed for non-pecuniary damages, past income loss, reimbursement for lost sick benefits, loss of income earning capacity (past and future), cost of future care, and special damages. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed.\n",
      " On the issue of liability, both Heuring and Smith had departed from the standard of reasonable care and fault should be apportioned to each. Heuring violated the Motor Vehicle Act and the resulting heightened common law duty of care. Smith also should have taken greater care and been more vigilant in observing the traffic. Liability was apportioned 40 per cent against Heuring and 60 per cent against Smith. On the issue of causation, the evidence did not support the conclusion that Heuring was not suffering from ongoing physical complaints and symptoms to his back and hips prior to the accident. Heuring's pre-accident and post-accident medical and treatment records reported very similar physical complaints. Heuring had suffered a soft tissue injury, but it did not render his pre-existing osteoarthritis symptomatic. On a balance of probabilities, Heuring's soft tissue injuries resolved no later than the summer of 2015. $40,000 was an appropriate award for non-pecuniary damages. Heuring's net income loss relating to missed opportunity at the union job was $11,825; his net past income loss from the hospital was $6,643. He was entitled to compensation for loss of sick leave benefits: $3,775. There was a real and substantial possibility Heuring would have retired in 2012 but for the accident; he was entitled to $50,000 for past loss of earning capacity. Heuring had not proven entitlement to damages for future loss of earning capacity. Treatment and mileage expenses incurred from the date of the accident to the end of June 2015 were proper special damages; the parties could agree or pursue an accounting. Total damages were $112,244, reduced by 60 per cent.\n",

      "Action by McKerr seeking damages from Connie, a mammography technician. McKerr had no pain or significant problems with her breast when she scheduled herself for a mammography on October 3, 2008. Connie was the experienced technician who performed the procedure. The clinic was busy with one mammography machine not working that day. McKerr claimed Connie was rushing the procedure and did not stop when she cried out in pain when her left breast was compressed during the procedure. Connie had no recollection of the specific mammogram, but testified she would stop a procedure if a woman indicated she was in severe pain. McKerr complained to the clinic within days because she was experiencing a lot of pain. She was referred to her family doctor, who advised her to attend for further investigation of the suspicious mammography results and a possible injury to her breast. McKerr left for Mexico but her pain increased while there, such that she had to hire a driver to bring her back to Canada in December 2008. By then, she was experiencing pain in her shoulder as well, and her breast had a large detectable mass in it. She was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer in January 2009. She underwent chemotherapy and a mastectomy. Breast cancer recurred in 2011, necessitating further chemotherapy and surgery. By the time of trial, McKerr's cancer had metastasized and was considered incurable. She presented expert evidence that a trauma to a breast with cancer cells in it could speed the growth and spread of cancer cells. Connie provided expert evidence to the contrary. \n",

      "Action by unit owners against the builder, engineering firm and the strata corporation. The plaintiffs purchased the unit from a previous owner in 2000 and began to notice water damage in 2004. The corporation sent a contractor who did repairs to the unit. The corporation retained the engineering firm for an assessment and the 2007 report noted there were deficiencies in the building envelope but described them as localized and relatively minor to repair. It recommended remedial work and a more comprehensive inventory assessment. The strata corporation instead proceeded with replacing roofs. By 2008, the plaintiffs claimed to have discovered mould in their unit, which was making them ill. The corporation recalled the engineering firm for a more comprehensive investigation and concluded the entire complex required building envelope remediation. The plaintiffs moved into a temporary residence in 2009 but the repairs were not completed until 2011. The plaintiffs then sold their unit. The plaintiffs alleged negligent design and construction by the builder, breach of duty and nuisance by the strata corporation, and negligence, negligent misrepresentation and nuisance against the engineering firm. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action dismissed.\n",
      " The plaintiffs failed to call any expert evidence, so there was no admissible evidence on whether their unit contained mould. Photographs simply showing black areas on walls were not sufficient proof. The plaintiffs also failed to call expert evidence on the standard of care for a builder and did not demonstrate negligence. The corporation regularly received repair requests from owners and dealt with them as best it could within budgetary constraints. When it became clear that significant building envelope problems existed, the corporation scheduled a meeting to attempt to pass resolutions to raise funds, which failed. It was clear the plaintiffs and corporation had a difficult relationship, but there was no evidence the plaintiffs were treated different than other owners or unfairly. It was pure speculation that the outcome would have been different had the firm been retained months earlier as the plaintiffs claimed it should have been. Given the roof was a localized repair recommended by the firm and the corporation was receiving increasing complaints about roof leaks, it acted reasonably in retaining a roofing consultant as a first priority. The corporation did not learn that vinyl siding was a bigger issue until 2008 and then quickly brought the firm back in for a more comprehensive assessment. The corporation investigated the plaintiffs' complaints, retained a contractor and an expert and sprayed for mould. The open walls in the unit were the plaintiffs' own doing and fixing them was not dependent on building envelope work. The plaintiffs were not misled on the status of repairs and there was no evidence of negligence or breach of agreement by the corporation. The corporation was not responsible for the rain or installation of detailing, and responded to complaints, so did not commit nuisance. The only expert evidence on the standard of care expected from the firm was called by the firm, and the expert opined it had been met. While it was easy to criticize the 2007 report in hindsight, that did not make it negligent. There was no evidence the report was misleading or untrue at the time, or that the outcome could have been different had it then identified issues the plaintiffs claimed should have been identified. The firm was a consultant and did not own or use the land in a manner that could sustain a nuisance claim.\n",

      "Determination of liability for injuries sustained by the claimant in a motor vehicle accident. The claimant was two years old at the time. The defendants were the owner and operator of the vehicle. The third parties were Nelson, who was caring for the claimant that day, and the grandparents, whom the claimant lived with. The defendants gave Nelson and the claimant a ride home, then ran over the claimant when they drove forward on the circular driveway to leave. The claimant's great uncle was home at the time and testified the vehicle pulled up and Nelson entered the house, followed by the defendant driver, carrying a stroller, while the claimant was playing unsupervised with a ball near the vehicle. The great uncle testified he saw the claimant crawl under the vehicle as the defendants were preparing to leave, and he yelled to the defendants, but too late. The defendant owner was in the passenger seat at the time and testified neither she nor the defendant driver exited the vehicle at the house. The owner testified she saw the claimant playing ball near the front door, but was nursing her own baby so was not really paying attention. The owner testified the driver checked the mirrors before pulling away and stopped immediately when they felt a bump. The claimant was lying under the vehicle, crying and bloody. The driver testified he saw Nelson hold the claimant's hand and take him into the house before unloading the vehicle, and that he saw the claimant standing in the doorway, but did not see him again. The driver denied exiting the vehicle, and testified he checked his mirrors and over his shoulder before driving away and did not see anyone nearby and the front door was closed, so assumed everyone was inside. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Liability apportioned equally between the defendants and Nelson.\n",
      " The defendants acknowledged they owed the claimant a duty of care based on reasonable foreseeability; this admission was also an acknowledgement the claimant was close enough to the vehicle that they owed a duty regardless of whether they assumed he was in the house. While there were gaps in the great uncle's version of events, his evidence was preferred over the defendants' evidence, which was contrived and largely reconstructed after the fact. The defendants had little recollection of goings on while parked, yet claimed to clearly remember the front door being shut and no one outside when they left. The great uncle's observations from the front door were more reliable, and his version was also supported by the owner's admission she saw the claimant playing ball. Whether or not the defendants ever left the vehicle, the claimant ended up underneath it. Nelson was equally available to either party to call, and was an interested party, so no adverse inference was drawn from the claimant's failure to call her. In summary, the defendants drove Nelson and the claimant home, and Nelson left the vehicle with the claimant playing unsupervised outside. The front door remained open while the groceries were being unloaded and the defendants paid little attention to what was going on. The great uncle saw the claimant go under the vehicle and called to the defendants, but they did not hear, and ran over the claimant. The presence of a child on or near the road gave rise to a duty to take special precautions due to the unpredictability of a young child's actions. In the circumstances, it was incumbent on the driver to not just check his mirrors and shoulders, but also to determine where the child was before he drove away; he could have asked another adult or got out and checked the perimeter of the vehicle. The driver failed to take reasonable precautions to ensure the claimant was not harmed, and the owner was vicariously liable under s. 86(1) Motor Vehicle Act. There was no evidence the grandparents were home or that Nelson was generally irresponsible and they should not have left the claimant with her, so the grandparents were not liable. Nelson had the same duty as a parent in the circumstances, and was negligent in leaving a two-year-old child playing unsupervised near a vehicle.\n",

      "Application by the Province defendants to strike portions of the plaintiff's statement of claim and dismiss the claims for damages based on negligence and breach of Charter rights. The plaintiff, Ivan Henry, spent 27 years in jail following his 1983 conviction on ten counts of sexual assault. He was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indefinite period of incarceration. In 2010, the Court of Appeal quashed the convictions and entered acquittals on all counts. The plaintiff sought damages for loss of liberty, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, lost income, and subjugation to prison life. He claimed against three sets of defendants alleging violations of his ss. 7, 10 and 11(d) Charter rights. The claims against the City of Vancouver defendants related to the police investigation and alleged that the City was negligent in failing to disclose similar post-arrest sexual assaults to the prosecution. The claims against the federal Crown alleged that it was negligent in the consideration of his applications for review of the convictions. The claims against the Province alleged that Crown counsel was negligent and engaged in malicious prosecution and misfeasance in public office throughout the course of the trial and appeal process. The Province submitted that the actions of Crown counsel in the course of a criminal prosecution were immune from civil liability other than through the tort of malicious prosecution. The Province sought dismissal of the claims based on negligence and breaches of the Charter. The Province relied on the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Application allowed in part.\n",
      " A Crown prosecutor did not owe a duty of care to an accused person in respect of the conduct of a prosecution. There was sufficient foreseeability and proximity supporting the existence of such duty. However, broader policy reasons, particularly the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity, negated a duty of care, subject to the presence of malice or abuse of office. It was plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim in negligence had no reasonable prospect of success and was thus dismissed. The plaintiff's claim for Charter damages incorporated acts and omissions that were either done maliciously, or with the knowledge that such conduct was unlawful and would probably cause injury to the plaintiff. Given the founding of the allegations on malice, it was not appropriate to strike the portion of the pleadings alleging a breach of Charter rights.\n",

      "Application by the Public Guardian and Trustee defendant to strike the claim. The plaintiffs in the proposed class action were under the care and custody of the province as minors and claimed to have received injuries in foster care due to tortuous and criminal acts. The Crown was also named as a defendant, and the plaintiffs claimed both the Crown and PGT failed to pursue compensation on their behalf, either civilly or under the Criminal Injury Compensation Act. The plaintiffs alleged breach of statutory duty, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, bad faith and misfeasance in public office. The PGT argued it had no positive duty to pursue claims for compensation on the plaintiffs' behalf. The plaintiffs argued their claims were similar to those advanced in a certified class action in Alberta and it would be premature to strike. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Application allowed in part.\n",
      " It was notable that the defendants in the Alberta claim had conceded there was a cause of action. The plaintiffs did not identify any specific statutory duty that the PGT breached, and the breach of statutory duty claim was bound to fail as there was no separate tort for this, and the governing legislation did not impose any duty on the PGT to seek compensation on behalf of children injured while in care; rather s. 7(2) of the Public Guardian and Trustee Act said it could do so in certain circumstances. The breach of statutory duty claim was struck. While the amended notice of claim referred to a failure to implement policies, the central element of the pleading was the PGT's alleged failure to obtain financial compensation for the plaintiffs and class members. Even with proper amendments, the claim relating to policies was bound to fail as implementation of policies was a statutory duty. As for the negligence claim, the PGT had specific obligations under the Act when acting as the property guardian of young persons in care, including making decisions in their best interests. This gave rise to a duty of care. The allegation that the PGT failed to properly consider whether to pursue compensation on behalf of young persons was not contrary to policy considerations, and the fact that the limitation period to seek damages for tortuous conduct did not begin to run until the minor reached the age of majority did not lead to the inexorable conclusion the minor suffered no loss from the PGT's failure to pursue compensation on their behalf; in fact, the plaintiffs alleged lost evidence, potential limitation defences and inability to use money sooner. Furthermore, the plaintiffs' claim under the Criminal Injury Compensation Act may be time barred. The negligence claim was not bound to fail, but was not properly pleaded with respect to the particulars of the duty and standard of care and was too vague, so the plaintiffs were granted leave to amend. The relationship between minors in care and the PGT in its capacity as property guardian was fiduciary in nature, and breach of fiduciary duty could be made out on the allegations the PGT failed to protect the plaintiffs, caused greater difficulty in their legal cases, placed the defendants' interests above the plaintiffs, and failed to consider the plaintiffs' legal rights. However, the fiduciary duty pleadings also contained many defects given the lack of details on the fiduciary relationship, specific duties and obligations, so leave to amend was granted. The bad faith claim was struck as this was not a stand-alone cause of action. The misfeasance in public office claim was struck as it was manifestly deficient, as the plaintiffs did not allege the PGT's conduct was deliberate or unlawful, and this claim was fundamentally inconsistent with the negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims that alleged the PGT owed private law duties.\n",

      "Action by a pedestrian for damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle-pedestrian accident and third party claim against the plaintiff's mother for contribution for negligent parenting. The 10-year-old plaintiff was struck by the 80-year-old defendant while attempting to cross the road in an unmarked crosswalk near her school. Prior to crossing the road, the plaintiff and her friends stopped at the curb and waited for traffic to stop. Three vehicles stopped in the curb lane and the plaintiff and her friends began to cross the road at a brisk pace. The defendant approached the intersection, but did not stop, and struck the plaintiff. The defendant alleged that she was travelling at approximately 30 km/h in the area, which she knew was a school zone. She did not expect the plaintiff and her friends to cross where they did as she believed there was no crosswalk there. The defendant denied having any vision problems. However, she had recently had cataract surgery and, at a follow up appointment the day after the accident, was found to have a cataract in her right eye. The defendant denied liability. Alternatively, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff was negligent and her own negligence caused her injuries. The defendant further claimed that the plaintiff's mother was negligent in failing to teach the plaintiff how to safely cross roads and, on the day of the accident, failed to supervise the plaintiff properly. \n",
      "\n",
      "HELD: Action allowed and third party claim dismissed.\n",
      " The defendant was focussed on what was occurring directly in front of her at the expense of what was occurring to her right, and had failed to notice traffic slowing in the curb lane signalling the likely presence of children on the roadway or about to enter it. Therefore, she overtook slowing traffic in the curb lane and failed to slow enough to allow her to respond to the possible emergence of children from the curb. In the circumstances, the defendant should have stopped beside the vehicles stopped in the curb lane before proceeding further. The plaintiff breached her duty under s. 179(3) of the Motor Vehicle Act. She did not have the right of way. The plaintiff had the right of way when she stepped onto the road. She likely could not see the defendant's approaching vehicle when she stepped into the intersection. She was entitled to expect that traffic in the next lane would stop for her, and she did not lose her right of way. The plaintiff was not negligent as she did not act in any way, such as running out in front of the defendant's vehicle, which would have prevented the defendant from responding and stopping her vehicle in sufficient time to avoid striking the plaintiff. The plaintiff's failure to walk a little slower and to stop before crossing the defendant's lane of traffic constituted an error of judgment and a momentary lapse in awareness, not contributory negligence. The traffic safety instructions given to the plaintiff by her mother met the standards that a reasonably prudent parent would find enough to equip a well-behaved 10-year-old child of average intelligence and without any relevant disability to cross an unmarked crosswalk safely.\n",

In January 2008, the defendant's vehicle collided with the plaintiff's vehicle as the plaintiff proceeded through an intersection. The plaintiff testified that he proceeded on a green light and denied that the light had changed to yellow as he approached the intersection. He testified that the light remained green after the impact. The defendant testified that the light was green for his direction of travel. The plaintiff, age 53 at the time of the accident, experienced headaches, vision impairment and back pain in the aftermath of the accident. He returned to part-time employment as a millwright in May 2008 and worked his way back to full-time employment on light duties. He aggravated his back in a 2009 workplace accident and was laid off due to an economic slowdown. A vocational assessment determined the plaintiff was unable to return to full duties as a millwright.

The plaintiff testified he struck the gas cap of the defendant's vehicle but damage was actually to the bumper.

The defendant denied making a u-turn and testified she turned to the left when struck.

The defendant entered the plaintiff's lane giving him no time to react and was negligent. However, the plaintiff was 25 per cent liable for not noticing the defendant had her turn signal on. The medical evidence established the plaintiff sustained a low back injury with nerve root involvement and continued to experience pain. The plaintiff was able to perform daily activities but was restricted from strenuous activity and the pain impaired his quality of life. The plaintiff had severe degeneration and recurring back and leg pain prior to the accident so the non-pecuniary award was reduced by 15 per cent for pre-existing injury. The plaintiff was entitled to $85,000 non-pecuniary damages. The plaintiff was able to continue his delivery business until his contract was terminated for unrelated reasons. The plaintiff did rely increasingly on subcontractors, however, which caused $10,000 past loss of income. The 49-year-old plaintiff was still unemployed and no longer capable of physical labour. Given the plaintiff's age, language barrier and injuries, he would likely be restricted to unskilled, part-time work. The plaintiff was entitled to $125,000 for future income loss.

The accident caused a major disruption to the plaintiff's life at a vulnerable time. She suffered a broken left leg, which fully healed within nine months, and soft tissue injuries to her spine. Her self-image and self-confidence were damaged as a result of struggling to catch up with her school work, leading to depression and major depression. The depression was now in the moderate to severe range and continued to affect her daily life. For a significant period of her late teens and early twenties, she had not been able to fully enjoy and engage in school, leisure or work. The prognosis for improvement in her psychological and psychiatric functioning was guarded, but not hopeless. There was a real and substantial possibility that the plaintiff's lost capacity would result in a pecuniary loss. Although she was an average student, she worked hard and was ambitious. A capital asset approach was used to assess the loss, given her age at the time of the accident and her circumstances. The award for cost of future care included contingency deductions to reflect the likelihood that the plaintiff would not incur the expenses, given her previous approach to recommended therapy and medication. The plaintiff did not fail to mitigate her damages. There was no evidence of recommendations with respect to her psychological and psychiatric problems until more than three years after the accident.\n",

      "Action by the plaintiff, Mackey, against the defendant, the Province, for damages to compensate for personal injuries. In 2007, the plaintiff, age 17, was part of a school choir visiting Victoria from Arizona. While en route to a performance, the plaintiff climbed a concrete baluster on a railing along the perimeter of a pedestrian plaza overlooking the waterfront. He swung around a lamppost that proved to be severely corroded. The lamppost came loose and the plaintiff fell from approximately 20 feet to a concrete walkway. The plaintiff suffered a traumatic brain injury and was hospitalized for five weeks. The Province, through a now-dissolved Crown corporation, owned and managed the plaza, including the railing and lamppost. The Province issued third party claims against the School district and chaperones responsible for the plaintiff and other students at the time of the accident. The Province took the position that the accident was wholly the fault of the plaintiff, or the plaintiff and the third parties. The plaintiff claimed that but for his injury, there was a real and substantial possibility he would have become an orthopedic surgeon. The Province submitted that the plaintiff's employment prospects were unchanged, as he was an average student who was and remained capable of modest employment. \n",
      "HELD: Action allowed.\n",
      " The lamppost was never inspected or maintained. Annual painting allowed the underlying corrosion to continue unchecked. The skirt of the lamppost was never bolted to the baluster for support. The plaintiff's accident would not have occurred, but for the state of the lamppost. However, the accident would not have occurred but for the plaintiff climbing the baluster and swinging around the lamppost. The Province was negligent and the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. The plaintiff's conduct was more blameworthy than that of the Province, as he mounted a safe railing with a dangerous drop. The Province could not escape liability, as the lamppost was an accident waiting to happen. Liability was apportioned 35 per cent to the Province and 65 per cent to the plaintiff. No liability was attributable to the third parties, who behaved reasonably throughout. The accident caused a substantial permanent brain injury that adversely impacted the plaintiff's bright future prospects. Although the plaintiff was able to marry and have a family, his injury left him immature, and unable to work in jobs requiring significant executive function, intellectual dexterity, and full emotional stability. The Province's submission that his past scholastic performance barred him from eventually becoming a surgeon was rejected. The plaintiff's exceptional drive and determination gave him a 60 per cent chance of achieving his career prospect, but for the accident. Prior to adjustment for his contributory negligence, the plaintiff was awarded $250,000 CAD for non-pecuniary damages, $15,000 CAD for an in-trust claim, $20,000 USD for costs of future care, and $4.53 million, USD, for loss of future earning capacity.

      "Action by Madill for damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident that occurred on June 28, 2004. Madill was a passenger in a vehicle that was driven by the defendant Howard. Howard was Madill's employer. The defendants Douang and Somchit Sithivong owned a vehicle that was driven by the defendant Linda Sithivong and that collided with Howard's vehicle. Linda's vehicle struck the rear passenger door where Madill was seated. Madill was 43 years' old and he was 37 at the time of the accident. Before the accident Madill and his wife led a very active lifestyle and they shared a passion for motorcycles. Madill was a very valuable employee. After the accident he changed significantly. His personality was different and, he could only work on a part-time basis. Madill was no longer able to drive his motorcycle because he suffered loss of balance. He was also unable to continue with his gardening, golfing, piloting and skydiving activities. Madill suffered debilitating headaches since the accident. He claimed that the mild traumatic brain injury he suffered affected his ability to work and all aspects of his life. \n",

      "HELD: Action allowed.\n",
      " The Sithivongs were fully responsible in negligence for the accident. Howard was not contributorily negligent. He had no chance to avoid the collision. Regarding non-pecuniary damages Madill and his wife were both credible witnesses. Madill experienced a significant change in his life and in his lifestyle. His loss of enjoyment of life was apparent. Linda's negligence materially contributed to Madill's injuries. Madill experienced headaches before the accident but they were manageable. They did not interfere with his work or with his extremely active lifestyle. The post-accident headaches were completely different. Madill suffered a mild traumatic brain injury, that was permanent, and the changes to his life were the result of injuries sustained in the accident. He did not exaggerate or make up his injuries, memory problems, loss of balance and his chronic headaches. Madill was awarded $110,000 for non-pecuniary damages. There was insufficient evidence to determine what past wage loss had occurred that would be attributable to the accident. Madill was awarded $650,000 for loss of earning capacity. His ability to earn and to work was no longer the same as it was before the accident. He was less valuable to potential employers. He was still employable but he was not as competitively employable than before the accident.\n",
